    description "This is the most powerful weapon in existence, greater even than the Drak's dreaded Antimatter Cannon. It symbolizes the Monads' quest for perfect engineering, and it is very nearly perfect itself. It generates very little heat and uses a complex system of prisms and lenses to maximize its firepower. For obvious reasons, the Drak destroyed all copies of the Energy Lens System, and killed those who knew its secrets. Still, there are rumors that some ancient Lens Systems may yet survive."
