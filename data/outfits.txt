	"cooling" 5
	description "When trying to cram as many high-powered outfits as possible into a ship, occasionally you reach the point where it is sporadically overheating and shutting down. In that case, you may need to install one of these."

	"mass" 10
	"outfit space" -10
	"cooling" 12
	description "This system is a step up from ordinary cooling ducts; it circulates water in between an external radiator and your ship's hottest internal components to keep them from overheating."

	"mass" 40
	"outfit space" -40
	"cooling" 69
	description "Liquid helium is the ultimate in cooling technology. Given how much space this cooling system takes up, you may be better off just installing more efficient, low-heat components instead, but where that is not an option, this cooler can handle almost anything you throw at it."

	category "Systems"
	cost 20000
	thumbnail "outfit/tiny shield"
	"mass" 15
	"outfit space" -15
	"shield generation" .2
	description "This is the standard shield generator for fighters and interceptors, as well as for many non-combat starships. Although it is possible for a ship to have no shield generator at all, recharging its shield matrix only when landed in a hospitable spaceport, life in deep space is unpredictable enough that most pilots find shield generators to be well worth the space they take up."

	category "Systems"
	cost 35000
	thumbnail "outfit/small shield"
	"mass" 22
	"outfit space" -22
	"shield generation" .32
	description "This is a slightly more powerful shield generator than the standard model installed in most small ships. If combat lasts long enough, the increased recharge rate is enough to give you an edge, but recharging your shields completely will still take a long time."

outfit "D41-HY Shield Generator"
	category "Systems"
	cost 65000
	thumbnail "outfit/medium shield"
	"mass" 30
	"outfit space" -30
	"shield generation" .51
	description "This is a more powerful shield generator designed for ships that are likely to see frequent combat, or that have such a large shield capacity that recharging them would take a long time with a smaller generator."

	category "Systems"
	cost 120000
	thumbnail "outfit/large shield"
	"mass" 45
	"outfit space" -45
	"shield generation" .82
	description "This shield generator is powerful enough that in combat against some particularly weak ships, they may not even be capable of depleting your shields as fast as they recharge."

outfit "D94-YV Shield Generator"
	category "Systems"
	cost 200000
	thumbnail "outfit/huge shield"
	"mass" 60
	"outfit space" -60
	"shield generation" 1.31
	description "This is the most powerful shield generator available in human space. Because of their large size, D94-YV shield generators are mostly used in large warships, but you can fit one in a smaller ship if you are willing to sacrifice engine power or weaponry to make space for it."

outfit "S-270 Regenerator"

	"mass" 12
	"outfit space" -12
	"shield generation" .6
	"energy generation" -.3
	"heat generation" 2
	description "A shield regenerator works by subtly modifying the geometry of your shield matrix in order to make your shields more malleable and therefore much easier to recharge. Unfortunately, this causes your shields to also become less efficient, which draws energy away from your other systems, even when not charging shields, and creates heat."

outfit "S-970 Regenerator"
	category "Systems"

	thumbnail "outfit/large regenerator"
	"mass" 37
	"outfit space" -37
	"shield generation" 2.3
	"energy generation" -.9
	"heat generation" 6
	description "The S-970 Shield Regenerator is an advanced type of shield recharging technology. Unfortunately, its power needs are rather high, and the shifts it makes in your shield configuration also result in some feedback that causes heat to build up in the regenerator, even when your shields are at full strength."

	"outfit space" -10
	"ramscoop" 1
	description "In the early days of space exploration, when ships could travel through half a dozen systems before encountering an established colony where they could refuel, ramscoops were an essential piece of equipment, harvesting plasma from the solar wind to refill your hyperspace fuel tanks. Although you can install more than one ramscoop, additional ramscoops on a single ship are not as effective as the first."

	category "Systems"
	cost 320000
	thumbnail "outfit/catalytic ramscoop"
	"mass" 16
	"outfit space" -16
	"ramscoop" 7
	description "Ramscoop technology has been almost unchanged for centuries, because with nearly every system in human space settled there has not been a pressing need for ships to generate their own fuel. But with the Free Worlds war making travel once again more difficult, some engineers in the Deep recently invented a much-improved ramscoop for use in their merchant fleets."

	"jump speed" .2
	"hyperdrive" 1
	description "This mysterious box sits quietly at the heart of your ship, thinking its own inscrutable thoughts. When it comes time to travel between the stars it sets off a nuclear fusion reaction powerful enough to level an entire city, and then somehow tucks the resulting explosion in between the folds of regular space-time like a wasp stinging an oak leaf to lay her eggs inside. Your ship rides the resulting ripple in the fabric of space."
	description "	They say that fewer than a dozen human beings alive today understand the inner workings of the hyperdrive."

	"mass" 30
	"outfit space" -30
	"scram drive" .2
	"hyperdrive" 1
	description "A Scram Drive is a specially designed hyperdrive that works even if your ship is traveling at a much higher speed, at the expense of using more fuel. If you are being pursued by pirates (or just want to get somewhere in a hurry) that extra bit of speed can make a big difference."


outfit "Cargo Scanner"
	category "Systems"
	cost 8000

	"mass" 1
	"outfit space" -1
	"cargo scan" 300
	description "This scanner allows you to scan the cargo holds of the ship you are currently targeting, as long as you are flying close enough to it. Patrol crafts use cargo scanners to detect illegal contraband."

	category "Systems"
	cost 24000
	thumbnail "outfit/outfit scanner"
	"mass" 2
	"outfit space" -2
	"outfit scan" 500
	description "This scanner allows you to determine what outfits are installed in the ship you are currently targeting, if you are willing to risk flying close enough to it to get a reading! The Republic Navy uses these scanners to detect when ships are equipped with illegal weaponry."

	"outfit scan" 400
	"cargo scan" 200
	"atmosphere scan" 100
	description "This is Republic military technology, a collection of scanners designed to fit perfectly inside one of their surveillance drones. Since the outputs are fairly standard, you could connect it to your own ship's systems if you want."

	"outfit space" 15
	"cargo space" -20
	description "A mass expansion allows you to sacrifice some cargo space in order to make room for more outfits, in situations where you need just a bit more space to install a particular system. It does not increase your weapon or engine space unfortunately."

	"outfit space" -20
	description "If you really want to make space for a few more passengers (or crew members, if you're trying to capture other ships), you can expand the living space of your ship into the area usually reserved for outfits."

	"bunks" 2
	"outfit space" -12
	description "Captains who do not care particularly much about the comfort of their passengers or crew can usually find a way to shove a bunk bed in behind the power generator or to hang a few hammocks from the engines as a makeshift way to make space for more people."

	thumbnail "outfit/interference plating"
	"mass" 4
	"outfit space" -4
	"scan interference" .5
	description "If you're in the habit of carrying illegal cargo or outfits, this plating increases the odds that a scan of your ship will fail to detect it. The more of these you install, the better your chances of evading detection. They won't keep anyone from noticing if you're flying an unlicensed ship, however."


outfit "Laser Rifle"
	category "Hand to Hand"
	cost 8000
	thumbnail "outfit/laser rifle"
	"capture attack" .6
	"capture defense" .8
	description "A laser rifle is a step up from the sidearms that crew members typically carry for defense against pirates: more powerful, and more accurate as well. For each of these rifles that one of your crew is wielding, your odds of capturing another ship or defending your own ship from boarders are increased substantially."

outfit "Fragmentation Grenades"
	category "Hand to Hand"
	cost 17000
	thumbnail "outfit/fragmentation grenades"
	"capture attack" 1.3
	"capture defense" .3
	description "Fragmentation grenades are an only marginally legal weapon for hand-to-hand combat when boarding a ship, useful for flushing out defenders who are hunkered down in defensible choke points inside their own ship. They are much less useful as a defensive weapon, but still better than nothing."

	"capture attack" 2.8
	"capture defense" .8
	"illegal" 1000000
	description "This is a highly illegal weapon for hand to hand combat when boarding an enemy ship. Because chemical weapons are banned by interstellar law, you can be severely fined for getting caught in possession of nerve gas canisters. But, they do clear out an enemy ship quicker than just about anything else..."


outfit "Local Map"

	cost 1000
	thumbnail "outfit/map"
	"map" 12
	description "This data chip contains complete information on the twelve star systems closest to this one: planets, ports, governments, trade prices, available services, etc. You can get all the same information just by exploring those systems yourself, but having a map can save you from making wrong turns if you are trying to travel through new territory to reach a certain system quickly."


outfit "Pilot's License"
	category "Special"
	cost 50000
	thumbnail "outfit/license"
	description "Without a pilot's license, you cannot purchase a ship on a Republic planet. And if you buy an unlicensed ship on another planet and then bring it into Republic space, you can be fined until you cough up the money for a license. Needless to say, this policy is not terribly popular with freelance merchant captains."
