			`As you conduct your business in the spaceport a very unusual sound suddenly rings out from a great many directions at once and you see coalition citizens of all types pause in their business and glance around with surprise and concern. Your translator snatches a couple of half-formed sentences to the effect of, "famine?" and "Ki Patek Ka?" which you recognize to be the Kimek homeworld. Such commentary vanishes within a handful of seconds though. As one, every screen or projector in the port flicks to the same broadcast, transmitting in perfect sync. People shuffle to ensure they have a view and your translator begins to do its best to relay to you the content of the message.`
			`	The message is not short and follows a thorough structure, informing you that this is a civic emergency broadcast, explaining from where the emergency has arisen, providing context on what exactly is at risk, and detailing the cause, expected consequence, and desired call to action. It is... profoundly professional.`
			`	It would seem that on Third Umber, a world naturally devoid of either a functioning biosphere or hydrosphere, an ambitious project has been underway for some time to turn a deep and secluded equatorial valley into a contained ecosystem. You learn that Kimek, while capable of reproducing and raising their larval young in birthing pods, naturally would spend their first year or so as a grub underground. The project has been a long-term effort in establishing a 'Grubbing Ground'. A relatively controlled environment with a functional but contained, and more importantly protected, ecosystem capable of supporting Kimek grubs in their infancy as a way to better support the billion or so inhabitants; a workforce who are otherwise dependent on immigration or comparatively resource-intensive birthing pods for rearing subsequent generations.`
			`	The world is relatively stable. In the inhabited areas this cool, dry world is so naturally sterile as to nearly be considered a sort of natural cleanroom. However, rarely, storms of surprising intensity occasionally sweep out of the polar areas, usually after being agitated by solar flux. While these storms pose no threat to the massive multi-storey, arcology-style structures that the Kimek favor for both accommodation and industry, it seems that there was a miscalculation in the designing of the project, and one such storm has slipped in and scoured the valley with frozen air and carbon sleet carried from the pole. Months of work on the final support structures has been lost, though the bulk of the project remains securely intact.`
			`	More problematically though, the delicate, freshly built ecosystem within the valley has been savaged. Whole species frozen to local extinction in a few short hours of furious bluster.`
			`	The developing ecosystem, the work of multiple years of effort, has been gutted only six months out from the date when the first grubs would expect to emerge into their final nymph phase above ground. A situation which would promptly see most of them starve in the current situation. The grubs would all have been burrowed deeply enough to endure the storm, but swift action needs to be taken to ensure their safety when they emerge.`
			`Significant funds have been allocated to rapidly bolster the project. The broadcast ends with a statement that, while government resources would obviously be mobilised to prevent the humanitarian disaster, the scale and urgency of the situation was such that all pilots, if they're able, are called upon to render assistance in transporting supplies until the crisis is resolved. Such jobs should appear on the boards within a day.`

			`As you approach to land this time you are instead directed to a small landing pad set up some considerable distance away from the spaceport, nearly a fifth of the way around the planet in fact. The reason for this becomes swiftly evident as high ridges rise around your ship and a truly massive structure slides into view.`
			`	Spanning between two peaks that stand above the ridge now flanking your ship, and set against the backdrop of a yet higher ridge with peaks of its own, a single monstrous construction stands a dizzying nearly eleven kilometers tall from the valley floor to the wavering, artificial ridge line created by its highest reaches. A ridge line which traces a path just over two kilometers in length from one side of the mountainous valley wall to the other.`
			`	The core of the structure is quite typical of Kimek design. A slightly irregular and blocky structure, wide at the base and tapering only extremely incrementally as each level stacks upon the previous one, reaching from the valley floor to perhaps eight kilometers off the ground. Its matte white exterior gleams brilliantly, standing out amongst the grey rocky crags surrounding it. Once your eyes have a second to adjust though you can focus on what surrounds it.`
			`	Flanking the artificial structural core, and extending far above it to the ridge line, is something which looks undeniably organic. A towering wall of burnt ocher with flecks of deep green that seems to have a lumpy texture, until you approach it closely enough to see that whatever it is is in fact millions of the same modular type structure mounded one atop the other in an interlocking slope which envelops the artificial core at the base and soars at a sheer angle well beyond it. On final approach to the landing pad you note with surprise, that the flecks of green are in fact leaves. Short pinnate fronds of something fern-like growing straight out of the ocher hued structure.`
			`	One of the geoscapers appears at your shoulder. "The living wall is impressive is it not?"`
			choice
				`	"It's alive?"`
					goto alive
				`	"It's enormous!"`
			`	"It is the most massive cavern-root structure ever built by Kimek. A project, greatly ambitious it is," confirms the Kimek.`
			label alive
			`	"The cavern-root tree from stagnant swamps native is, cultivated in prehistory by those who braved to endure the cold polar islands during great strife of Ki Patek Ka. Forms warm open spaces underground. Good microbiome it fosters, made good fake burrows before learn to build better Kimek did. Tricked into growing above ground it can be with geotextiles and moisture gel. Ancient building technique still use by religious sect, make one grow into next, join to make greater whole, made larger by smart Kimek today."`
			choice
				`	"Larger feels like an understatement."`
				`	"Can a tree that large truly support itself?"`
			`	The Kimek tilts its head and your translator seems to take a slightly longer time to process their next statement. "On other side valley floor lies against it, kilometers of roots stretch out and water table intersects with foundation. Prevents outflow from valley does cavern-root mound, plenty to sustain itself. Hard to tell also because such great height, but nearly kilometer thick at base it is. Very strong natural structure is, made like," and here the translator seems to pause lengthily for a second before continuing, "honeycomb."`
			`	The Kimek focuses your ship display on a section near the top where you now suddenly notice that the wavering property of the ridge line was not at all intentional, "Damaged by storm there it has been. Reason for our presence it is."`
			`	Before you can raise further question though the Kimek wordlessly turns to leave as the final landing procedure completes and the specialists begin rapidly disembarking. Outside Rounded Purple B14 emerges and gesticulates at you until you go outside to meet him.`
			`	"Returned to us you have Captain, great appreciation have I," says Rounded Purple B14.`

mission "Double Haze Soup"
	The experts you brought earlier have been making progress and now some of them have identified something they think they need. You are sent to collect a large shipment of non-pressurised gas containers containing atmosphere from Double Haze, rich in its bacterial soup, to enhance the ecosystem of the valley.
	
mission "Witness the Birthing"
	You are thanked (and rewarded) again for all of your assistance. You are invited to (optionally) witness the great birthing. This ends the mission chain either way. If you witness it you get to see tens of thousands of Kimek crawl their way out of the ground and engage in a feeding frenzy on the tuberous plantlife and supplementary piles of food distributed about the valley. You will find that the digestive juices they vomit up onto their food bond with soil particles, creating a thin impermeable layer that prevents all their juices and dissolved food from seeping into the soil before they can eat it. This layer is later eaten by a soil bacterium, so that the soil isn't just covered in a permanent layer of kimek digestive juices.




"Young Kimek only emerge from underground when it has recently rained and the air is humid. Adult Kimek would learn to take food back to their burrow in the dry season. Of course, that became unnecessary when we developed houses."
