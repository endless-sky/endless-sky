			`As you conduct your business in the spaceport a very unusual sound suddenly rings out from a great many directions at once and you see coalition citizens of all types pause in their business and glance around with surprise and concern. Your translator snatches a couple of half-formed sentences to the effect of, "famine?" and "Ki Patek Ka?" which you recognize to be the Kimek homeworld. Such commentary vanishes within a handful of seconds though. As one, every screen or projector in the port flicks to the same broadcast, transmitting in perfect sync. People shuffle to ensure they have a view and your translator begins to do its best to relay to you the content of the message.`
			`	The message is not short and follows a thorough structure, informing you that this is a civic emergency broadcast, explaining from where the emergency has arisen, providing context on what exactly is at risk, and detailing the cause, expected consequence, and desired call to action. It is... profoundly professional.`
			`	It would seem that on Third Umber, a world naturally devoid of either a functioning biosphere or hydrosphere, an ambitious project has been underway for some time to turn a deep and secluded equatorial valley into a contained ecosystem. You learn that Kimek, while capable of reproducing and raising their larval young in birthing pods, naturally would spend their first year or so as a grub underground. The project has been a long-term effort in establishing a 'Grubbing Ground'. A relatively controlled environment with a functional but contained, and more importantly protected, ecosystem capable of supporting Kimek grubs in their infancy as a way to better support the billion or so inhabitants; a workforce who are otherwise dependent on immigration or comparatively resource-intensive birthing pods for rearing subsequent generations.`
			`	The world is relatively stable. In the inhabited areas this cool, dry world is so naturally sterile as to nearly be considered a sort of natural cleanroom. However, rarely, storms of surprising intensity occasionally sweep out of the polar areas, usually after being agitated by solar flux. While these storms pose no threat to the massive multi-storey, arcology-style structures that the Kimek favor for both accommodation and industry, it seems that there was a miscalculation in the designing of the project, and one such storm has slipped in and scoured the valley with frozen air and carbon sleet carried from the pole. Months of work on the final support structures has been lost, though the bulk of the project remains securely intact.`
			`	More problematically though, the delicate, freshly built ecosystem within the valley has been savaged. Whole species frozen to local extinction in a few short hours of furious bluster.`
			`	The developing ecosystem, the work of multiple years of effort, has been gutted only six months out from the date when the first grubs would expect to emerge into their final nymph phase above ground. A situation which would promptly see most of them starve in the current situation. The grubs would all have been burrowed deeply enough to endure the storm, but swift action needs to be taken to ensure their safety when they emerge.`
			`Significant funds have been allocated to rapidly bolster the project. The broadcast ends with a statement that, while government resources would obviously be mobilised to prevent the humanitarian disaster, the scale and urgency of the situation was such that all pilots, if they're able, are called upon to render assistance in transporting supplies until the crisis is resolved. Such jobs should appear on the boards within a day.`

mission "Mound Reconstruction"
	Upon returning you are asked to go and collect a large shipment of geotextiles and cavern-root seeds from the homeworld. The isolated valley was made so by building a mound-city in the main mountain pass that allowed the weather systems to flow in and out of the valley, but the city (still largely uninhabited and not technically finished) was damaged by the storm. The mound-city is a traditional, though now rarely used, building method using a plant from their world that creates underground chambers in which it fosters a specific micro-biome for procesing nutrients in nutrient-poor environs (it's native to cold, stagnant swamps near the poles of their homeworld). With the aid of geotextiles they can manipulate it into building very stable, earthquake resistant, hive-like structures many dozens of stories taller than it would naturally grow in nature. They now need to repair and expand the one here to better seal off the valley.
		Note: update planet description here
	
mission "Creche Herders"
	With the mound-city provisioned you're asked to go and collect a number of creche herders, Kimek who specialise in the raising of freshly matured Kimek emerging from their underground grub state. Their ship has been waylaid by Heliarch demands, leaving them without transport and the great birthing is imminent. 
	
mission "Double Haze Soup"
	The experts you brought earlier have been making progress and now some of them have identified something they think they need. You are sent to collect a large shipment of non-pressurised gas containers containing atmosphere from Double Haze, rich in its bacterial soup, to enhance the ecosystem of the valley.
	
mission "Witness the Birthing"
	You are thanked (and rewarded) again for all of your assistance. You are invited to (optionally) witness the great birthing. This ends the mission chain either way. If you witness it you get to see tens of thousands of Kimek crawl their way out of the ground and engage in a feeding frenzy on the tuberous plantlife and supplementary piles of food distributed about the valley. You will find that the digestive juices they vomit up onto their food bond with soil particles, creating a thin impermeable layer that prevents all their juices and dissolved food from seeping into the soil before they can eat it. This layer is later eaten by a soil bacterium, so that the soil isn't just covered in a permanent layer of kimek digestive juices.




"Young Kimek only emerge from underground when it has recently rained and the air is humid. Adult Kimek would learn to take food back to their burrow in the dry season. Of course, that became unnecessary when we developed houses."
