	description `These hardy little cargo ships are the perfect size for young Arachi just setting out into the sky with dreams of one day building their own merchant fleets.

	description `Arach cargo ship hulls are legendary for their durability. It is not uncommon for a large Arach family to convert a freighter that is no longer space-worthy into a planet-side dwelling, and even in the harshest of conditions these converted houses can last for hundreds of years with little or no exterior maintenance.`

	description `The Arach Hulk is an ungainly, lumbering behemoth of a ship, but with its side pods removed it becomes the much more maneuverable Spindle. Because of its much lower cargo space, usually the only reason a fleet would include a Spindle is if they are planning on picking up new cargo pods at their destination.`

	description `During their time battling the Quarg, the Coalition focused on producing the strongest, toughest warships they could, so fightercraft were out of the question. Now, however, the Heliarch's shield matrix and hull integrity technology is much more advanced, and they have recently experimented with such ships. The Judicator was made for transportation of these new fighters.`
	description `	Alongside their six fighter bays, Judicators come with a large bunk count and higher cargo space than other Heliarch warships, thus doubling as a logistics vessel for transporting troops and equipment.`

Most of the ceilings are too short for a Saryd to stand up straight, and the beds are too small for an Arach to stretch their legs out comfortably.`
