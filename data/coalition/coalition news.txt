			"A news broadcast shows footage of many Heliarch agents arresting a group of terrorists. The Heliarch who was supervising the operation is later interviewed, explaining that the new prisoners were found to have stolen government equipment."
			"The news show a Heliarch consul giving a short speech in a ship launching ceremony. After they finish, the brand new Heliarch warships are shown heading to their first patrol."
			"All the spaceport screens momentarily swap to a broadcast from the Heliarch government, where they show a video of several dozens of arrested criminals. The Heliarch host describing the event mentions their sentences range from 40 years to life, prompting varying reactions from the civilian spectators."
			"During one of the more busy hours on the spaceport, the news details the crimes of a recently arrested terrorist group: arson, kidnapping, theft of government equipment, possession of weapons, conspiring against the Coalition, attacking both government and civilian properties, subversion... The list goes on for a few more minutes."
			`After the latest report on how the Heliarchs arrested some terrorists on a nearby world, the news shows various short clips with the same message, asking the public to "stay vigilant" and report any and all suspicious activity.`

			"A local screen shows a stressed Saryd working at a computer late at night. The door creaks, and she looks back to find her children peeking. She puts them to sleep and then goes to bed herself. After waking up, she finds nobody around the house. She goes outside, seeing the children, along with their father, admiring the sun rising."
