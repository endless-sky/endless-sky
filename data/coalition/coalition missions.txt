On many Coalition worlds, all three species live together in harmony, which is made easier by the fact that each species prefers a very different climate and thus gravitates to different parts of a planet. They are ruled by individuals known as the Heliarchs.`
		conversation
			`This planet seems to be inhabited by at least three different sentient species. First are giant beetles, about a meter tall, who scurry quickly toward your ship and swarm around it, gawking at you, as soon as you land. The second species, even more disturbing than the beetles, are giant spiders. And the third species are centaurs. Not just something vaguely resembling centaurs; they look like they could have stepped right off the page of a story book from ancient Earth.`
			`	One of the spiders walks up to you, stretching its legs to raise its face and many eyes to the level of your own face, and says something to you in a gloopy sort of burbling language that you don't understand. The beetles, meanwhile, are talking to each other in a different language, all clicks and chittering. And the centaur stands quietly at a distance and keeps glancing back toward the spaceport as if waiting for someone.`
			`	And eventually, someone does arrive: a beetle, a spider, and a centaur all wearing yellow armbands and some sort of electric box hanging on a chain around each of their necks. They walk up to you, and the centaur speaks. After a brief delay, the box around its neck says, "In the name of the Heliarchs, who drove out the oppressors, who maintain peace, we the human visitor greet."`
			choice
				`	"Thank you."`
					goto next
				`	"How do you know my language?"`
			`	The spider speaks, and the box around its neck translates. "Our nearest and most recent neighbor you are. The Heliarchs in their great wisdom, all things that come to pass in our region of space, they are aware of."`
			label next
			`	Speaking through its own translation box, the beetle says, "To the seat of the Heliarch government must you go. Once to the Heliarchs you have become known, in many ways to our society, contribute you may."`
			`	The centaur pulls out a map printed on a thin sheet of plastic. You recognize it as a star map of this region. Lines mark out three different territories, and where they meet are three star systems colored yellow. The centaur points to the southernmost of the three. "Where you must go, here it is," it says.`
			choice
				`	"Thank you. I will go there."`
					goto end
				`	"Can you tell me more about yourselves, first?"`
			`	The spider says, "The wise Heliarchs, all your questions they will answer."`

Thousands of years ago, the Heliarchs led their three species to band together and drive the Quarg out of Coalition space. The Heliarch centers of government are the three Quarg ringworlds that they captured in that war. They are the only ones in Coalition space who are allowed to have weapons on their starships, and they act as a sort of police force, maintaining peace between the Coalition species.`

			`Your first view of the landing area confirms beyond a doubt that this is a Quarg ringworld, not just an imitation of one. The interior architecture is unmistakable. But no Quarg are present here, only the three species of the Coalition. Soon after you land, a delegation approaches your ship: again, one of each species, but these are wearing golden circlets around their heads. The circlets are not merely decorative, but seem to contain some electronics as well.`
			`	Again, the centaur speaks first. "To our territory, to welcome you we are glad," it says.`

For six thousand Earth years now, in prosperity and freedom from Quarg constraint and in friendship with each other we have lived."`

"A second Coalition you are forming!" says the centaur, tapping its hooves on the floor in excitement. "Once again, foiled the Quarg are. A secret way for species to work together, they have overlooked. Great things, from this may come."`
			label end
			`	You talk with them for a while longer, and learn that the centaurs are called "Saryds," and are the oldest of the three species. The beetles are the "Kimek," and come next, and the spiders are called "Arachi," and were the last of the three to discover spaceflight.`
			`	They tell you that the best way to learn more about them is to visit their worlds, and to see for yourself how the three species live in friendship and equality. They also offer to give you jobs to do in their territory, so that you may become a "valuable contributor" to their society.`

			`As the athletes leave your ship and hand you your pay of 300,000 credits, Pairri stretches her legs, trying to get on eye-level with you.`
			`	You crouch, and she says, "Incapable of arriving on time, a mutual friend of ours was. Available, their ticket is."`
			`	They extend one of their legs to you, holding a small, coin-like piece, with a symbol like the one of the old Olympic games on Earth, only this one only has three rings, all interlocked with each other.`
			`	"Very long and tiring, for a first timer the games can be, as if in an hour, to read an entire novel one were to" Tumub says. "Understand, we would, if too busy to watch them, you are."`

			`	"A grand, cooperative match, at the end of it all takes place," Ulmodi further details. "Teams consisting of all three species, formed they are. A joyous, unmatched experience, the last spectacle is."`
			`	Needing to hastily leave to prepare for their turn at the games, they can't tell you much about what each one of the sports consist of, but assure you that you will like them. You find a Heliarch agent, and they quickly point you to the line where people are checking in with their own tickets. The line must be thousands long, but you barely spend ten minutes in it, the Heliarchs taking care of admissions being incredibly efficient and keeping things organised.`
			`	After that, you find yet another Heliarch, who shows you where you should go for each competition; three massive transports, similar in design to old-school bullet trains, each taking you to a different 'arena' for a different type of game.`
			`	They also explain that you'll take a separate train to go to the 'grand spectacle' at the end of it all, which will be available for boarding in any one of the three arenas after those matches are done. You thank them for the explanation, and decide on which train to take.`

			`	You arrive at a massive, stadium-like structure, only it's actually shaped like a half moon. The place overlooks a huge valley, with many small drones flying over it, and transmitting live footage to the dozens of cinema sized screens, for those that can't get a clear view through the glass.`
			`	You notice a structure similar to the starting area seen in horse races, on one of the sides of the track. A few minutes pass, and the massive crowd is in uproar as an alarm sounds, and the doors open: several Saryd leave the structure, having wheeled machines, similar to chariots, attached to them. They are also carrying bows and arrows.`
			`	The race is erratic, the contestants being allowed to take any of the several paths across the increasingly dense forest in the valley, while they attempt to shoot arrows at some projected targets that appear for short periods of a few seconds while they pass close to them. Eventually, you have to turn and look at the massive monitors, as it becomes impossible to follow the race by looking out the window.`
			`	As you turn to look, one of the participants' "chariot" hits one of the trees, and they slow down, eventually coming to a full stop. Although the drones following each Saryd isn't transmitting the sound (the only sounds being voices of who you believe are commentators, though you can't understand their language), it is clear from his overall expression and the way he threw the readied arrow at the ground makes you realize he has probably been disqualified.`
			`	While they move to a more convoluted part of the woods, with several tall brambles and many ledges, the targets start appearing at a progressively faster rate. One of the monitors focuses on one particular racer, who manages to not miss a single shot in a segment with seven different targets in a row. Looking at a smaller, but still massive screen with pictures of the contestants, you see that the picture of this racer rises many positions. It seems that hitting these targets count for gaining points during the race.`
			`	You couldn't count how many there were at the start of the race, due to the sheer number of Saryds and the way they rapidly changed course multiple times during the competition, but as the race approaches its end, and some of the contestants cross a stream serving as the finish line, you manage to identify that there are thirty that made it. The drones end their transmission, as the monitors cut to a group on the ground that starts interviewing the ones that made it.`
			`	After some short statements from the first three arriving contestants, you see that Ulmodi is up next, it seems he arrived in fourth place. You think the entire event is over, as the crowd starts dispersing (again with Heliarch agents overseeing everything), but instead of heading back to the train, they're moving to a separate section of the odd stadium.`
			`	You go with the crowd, and are shown to a room with many elevators. Eventually, everyone descends to the valley below, and follow a path to an actual, full-size stadium, and a massive one at that.`
			`	Awkwardly sitting in the middle of all these alien beings, it hits you that you're probably the first human ever to witness these games. You eye the stadium grounds, oddly it has some small mounds, and six holes: four in the corners, and two across the middle of the longer side of the rectangular grounds.`
			`	Roughly half an hour passes, and a Kimek sitting next to you, who thankfully had a translation device, explains that the contestants are resting. A couple more minutes pass, and the thirty Saryds enter the grounds, and are divided into six teams, each donning a different color, and equipped with what looks like some fancy polo mallets. You see that Ulmodi is on the blue team. Several large spheres are placed at the center of the stadium, with one member of each team around them, forming a circle.`
			`	The game starts, some sort of mix between polo, billiards, and golf. The teams trot around for a while, then rapidly rush to the spheres once they see an opening in the others' defenses. As they hit the spheres with their mallets, they roll around the mounds, curving all over, sometimes even accidentally being flung to the audience.`
			`	Eventually one of them enters one of the holes, which lights up with the color of the team that made the shot: the red team has scored a point. Many of the crowd stand up and a multitude of screams echo across the arena, you're not sure if everyone here is a fan of the red team, or if they all will cheer whenever someone gets a point. The sphere is brought back up automatically via a tube close to the hole, and it's back in the game.`
			`	Points keep rolling in as the teams score goals, with eventually the blue team getting their fifth point. The crowd gets even crazier than before, and the entire blue team comes together and celebrates, while the other five teams aren't quite as enthusiastic. The commentators say something, and the helpful Kimek sitting beside you once again helps you understand it all.`
			`	"The winning score, they have reached! The winners, the blue team are!" They say, still in the cheering mood. After everyone settles down, the members of the teams are shown in the replay screen, going from the team that scored the least, all the way to the blue team at the end. Ulmodi is placed third, which must mean a lot, considering him and the other two above him celebrate by running laps around the inside of the stadium.`
			`	All things said and done, all teams gather together once again, for a moment of comradeship. They leave the arena, and so the crowd starts to leave the stadium.`
			`	You get back to where the train dropped you, and see that another one has arrived on the opposite side. A Heliarch agent explains that it is the one that leads to the final arena, where the cooperative game will take place.`

			`	The overly packed train takes you to a savanna plain, where you are faced with a colossal skyscraper. The interiors are like multiple stadiums stacked one on top of the other, and at the center, many inner rings, held in place by beams connecting them to the area with all the seats. Hundreds of Heliarch agents work to keep the nonstop stream of Kimek entering in an orderly fashion, and allocate everyone to their seats.`
			`	You ask one of the agents about the multiple 'floors' and rings, and they say that, due to their high population, the Kimek naturally end up having way more athletes come to the games than the other species, so their own competition is set here, with twenty stadium-floors.`
			`	"To other floors, at any point you may go," they say. "To the elevators, you must go, if to see another floor, you wish."`
			`	You ask them for a way to find out where Pairri will be competing; seeing as you don't really understand any of this, you should at least stick to a floor where someone you know will be participating.`
			`	They point you to a separate group of agents inside, working with many computers and helping the neverending flow of Kimek find their own preferred floors. Eventually, they point you to the sixteenth floor, and you head to the elevators, which are just as packed as the train was. You get to your seat, in the middle of hundreds of Kimek. You see the occasional group of Arach, and the loner Saryds stand tall amidst the crowds waiting for the matches to begin.`
			`	Some extending bridges connect with the ring, and tons of Kimek start gathering on the massive arena. Heliarch agents stay in the middle, as the crowd is divided into two teams. By the looks of it, each team must have several hundred Kimek. The Heliarchs leave, and after a long whistle the two teams charge at one another.`
			`	In the starting seconds, dozens of Kimek fall from the ring, onto the nets on the side, and are helped back to the surrounding seats by several workers. It seems this first stage works like a collective sumo match. After enough have fallen out, another whistle is heard, and everyone stops fighting. Heliarch agents get back on the ring and reorganize those that remain into two teams once again. This time about a minute passes before anyone falls off, the fighters have some actual personal space to work with this time, so they're probably much more comfortable fighting this way.`
			`	This process repeats a few more times, until finally all the ones that remained after everything are gathered in the center of the ring. You estimate that about less than one percent of the ones that first entered. Everyone leaves the ring, and you're standing there in confusion for a while, unsure if the game has ended.`
			`	You feel something tap the top of your head, and turn around to see an Arach sitting behind you, "Confused, the human visitor is?" Their little box translates.`
			`	You nod, and they decide to briefly breakdown the competition during this break. "Numerous, the Kimek are, so more athletes, they have," they say. "Tens of thousands, at first enter. Redone, the teams are, once in half, that number is cut."`
			`	They further tell you that once the number of Kimek in the ring reaches two hundred and fifty, the game only stops again once only one hundred remain. That brings you to now, when the hundred enter the ring once again, and are all set to fight individual matches, over some miniature rings drawn on the floor of the main one. This time they all are wearing some sort of goggles over their heads, perhaps as protective gear.`
			`	You find Pairri is set to fight close to where you're sitting, so you get a good view of her fights. While she is short even by Kimek standards, she stands her ground and manages to beat some slightly larger opponents, driving them out of the circular limit of the rink.`
			`	Above the large arena, some monitors depict the fighters and seem to show their score: fighters that lose a match don't leave altogether, instead they rotate counter-clockwise, fighting others to try and climb back up to the winning spots.`
			`	Eventually, after many of these rounds and rotational swap outs, Pairri and her next opponent wait as the other forty-eight finish their own fights, then move to the center of the field.`
			`	"Undefeated, the both of them are," the Arach behind you says. "The floor victor, the winner of this final match will be."`
			`	The whistle sounds again and Pairri charges at her slightly larger opponent, pressuring them and getting them close to the edge. They redirect the force by going to their side, and both start a battle of attrition close to the limits of their rink. Her opponent repositions themself to the middle, and tries to charge at her, but she closes the gap and they start wrestling in the middle. After a while they get back to the border, with Pairri pressing the other Kimek once again, as they get closer and closer to being out of bounds. Suddenly, her opponent manages to grip her with their frontal legs, and by lifting their own body up with the other four, just barely launching her up.`
			`	Pairri falls just outside the ring, and shortly after the other Kimek also falls on their back, touching the ground outside the limiting line. You hear the whistle once again, and as the both of them get up and approach each other for what must be the Kimek equivalent of a handshake, it becomes clear that Pairri lost, considering she touched the ground first.`
			`	Heliarch agents make sure everyone leaving the floor proceeds in an orderly fashion, and you take the elevators back down, returning to the entrance. Once again you see another train, and the Arach that talked to you confirms that it leads to where the cooperative game will take place, just before they board the one leading to the Saryd game.`

			`	When the train stops, you find yourself inside a building akin to a spaceport, only the ships are a mix between a helicopter and a raft. Other visitors start getting on the flying platforms, and you go for one of them. The rafts have adjustable seats, their default position being perfect for the Arachi, but moving a few parts makes them capable of accommodate Kimeks and even Saryds. You manage to also get your own seat to be good enough for a human to use.`
			`	Once the 'rafts' are full, they leave their docks and start flying outwards, and as soon as you're outside, you're greeted by a lush rainforest, as you fly beside some massive trees, bird-like creatures with funneled beaks flying to and from them and the carpet of green below. In the distance, you see what appears to be an ocean, but one of the Heliarch agents in charge of the raft says that it's actually a river.`
			`	Getting closer and closer to a spot where multiple of the colossal trees are in close proximity to one another, you arrive at the same time as some slightly smaller rafts, these ones with symbols on their coverings, a different one for each. The Heliarch agents on your own raft are too busy getting the raft positioned, from the looks of it, so you ask a Saryd seated next to you, after noticing they're carrying a translation box.`
			`	"The multiple Arach houses, the symbols they represent," she says. "To be patrons of atheletes, is a custom of members of the great houses."`
			`	The different rafts all start slowly lowering their altitude, getting close to the center of the area with the massive plants. They resemble oak trees, but with leaves many times the usual size, and many vines hanging from the branches, and even extending to other trees.`
			`	When they're finally close enough, you see that the vast majority of the 'vines' are actually ropes, as they connect all trees in a intricate, scattered web. Dozens of medium-sized rafts position themselves under the ropes, four rafts for each, and start moving away from each other, revealing a net connected to both rafts. Finally, one final flying platform comes in, being above everyone else, and having multiple large screens under it, serving as the monitors on which the symbols you saw on the contestants' rafts are shown, and shortly after each one of them, a list of Arachi follows.`
			`	"Damaged, the forest would be, if grand colosseums here were built," the Saryd says. "Those moving sections, every year are prepared. For the games, they are designed."`
			`	The participants' rafts hover near the top of the largest, central tree, and all of them leave, staying at the very top of the crown, as the rafts move away. As the spectator rafts start passing closer to the top of the tree to see the contestants, you spot Tumub amidst the crowd. He sees you, and stands up higher by stretching his legs, perking his head up to say hi. You also notice that there's a symbol painted on the top of his abdomen, one of the symbols representing an Arach house, with the painting depicting multiple Arach legs, interlocked with each other, as if forming a tightly knit web.`
			`	You are told by the Saryd that it is the symbol for house Debdo, the Arach house that specialises in the service industries. They're about to pinpoint the other symbols and tell you which house each one represents, but a short siren is heard, and the contestants start moving down the main tree. You do your best to follow Tumub's movements, yet shortly after the game begins you lose his position, as the groups of Arach all move rapidly to other trees, holding onto the ropes.`
			`	They spread out to different trees, some ropes leading directly to the top, others attached to the middle or even lower trunk, and then they climb up to the top. Whenever a group is at the top, they start looking in the middle of the leaves, sometimes nearly burrowing themselves in them.`
			`	Eventually some find some shiny, colored rings, which they attach to their legs, and then carry on to other trees, some going for a clockwise route around the main tree, some going counter clockwise, some even going back to the central tree, and then taking another route from there.`
			`	After a couple Arach have already 'cleared' three different treetops, as they struggle to get across the straight rope leading to their fourth, their legs appear to give out, as they fall down to the nets below. You look to the size, seeing that the Heliarchs on the raft are passing a few of the rings to the people here, as if to let everyone see the weight the athletes have to support with each one. When one of them finally gets to you, you hold it with both arms, and still almost let it fall down. The Heliarch explains that they are made similarly to the hulls of Arach ships, so they are incredibly dense, incredibly heavy metals all in one alloy.`
			`	As more and more competitors clear the trees of the needed rings, it becomes clear that one needs to get a ring from each tree to 'pass'. The order at which they approach the trees shows to be part of their strategy, as the ropes leading to sections that require climbing prove to be impossible for those with too many rings. When only thirty Arach remain, they're all at the top of the central tree, having collected all the rings. You see Tumub is amongst them, as the rings are removed and a scoreboard ranks the time each one took: Tumub is placed fifth, tied with another Arachi.`
			`	As a last part of the game, the thirty that passed are presented with heavy suits of armor, brought in by three separate cargo rafts. They all don the bulky suits, and all the rafts with nets leave their positions, getting all in a long, straight line. Two more larger rafts head to the middle, and move apart, revealing a very thin metallic pipe, connected to the both of them. The Arach are brought to the pipe, where they stand still, having to balance themselves on their legs while all the weight of the armor is upon them.` 
			`	"A testament of one's endurance, this stage is," the Saryd says. "Proud of their ships' and their own resilience, the Arach are. To hold on the longest, the objective is." A minute is about to pass when the first ones start falling to the nets, one after the other. Two minutes in and only four remain, only to fall a few seconds after.`
			`	The final results come in, and Tumub actually climbed up to the second spot now. He, the one ranked above him, and seven others celebrate vigorously, as if they have been qualified for something. A heavy storm being on its way, the judges and commentators speak quickly, and soon after everyone is back on a raft, being transported back to the initial building.`
			`	When you step off the raft, you see that aside from the train that brought you here, the one to the final games is also parked. As she leaves the raft too, the Saryd that was sitting next to you walks toward it for boarding.`

Hundreds of Heliarch agents work to keep the nonstop stream of Kimek entering in an orderly fashion, and allocate everyone to their seats.`
			`	You ask one of the agents about the multiple 'floors' and rings, and they say that, due to their high population, the Kimek naturally end up having way more athletes come to the games than the other species, so their own competition is set here, with twenty stadium-floors.`
			`	"To other floors, at any point you may go," they say. "To the elevators, you must go, if to see another floor, you wish."`
			`	You ask them for a way to find out where Pairri will be competing; seeing as you don't really understand any of this, you should at least stick to a floor where someone you know will be participating.`
			`	They point you to a separate group of agents inside, working with many computers and helping the neverending flow of Kimek find their own preferred floors. Eventually, they point you to the sixteenth floor, and you head to the elevators, which are just as packed as the train was. You get to your seat, in the middle of hundreds of Kimek. You see the occasional group of Arach, and the loner Saryds stand tall amidst the crowds waiting for the matches to begin.`
			`	Some extending bridges connect with the ring, and tons of Kimek start gathering on the massive arena. Heliarch agents stay in the middle, as the crowd is divided into two teams. By the looks of it, each team must have several hundred Kimek. The Heliarchs leave, and after a long whistle the two teams charge at one another.`
			`	In the starting seconds, dozens of Kimek fall from the ring, onto the nets on the side, and are helped back to the surrounding seats by several workers. It seems this first stage works like a collective sumo match. After enough have fallen out, another whistle is heard, and everyone stops fighting. Heliarch agents get back on the ring and reorganize those that remain into two teams once again. This time about a minute passes before anyone falls off, the fighters have some actual personal space to work with this time, so they're probably much more comfortable fighting this way.`
			`	This process repeats a few more times, until finally all the ones that remained after everything are gathered in the center of the ring. You estimate that about less than one percent of the ones that first entered. Everyone leaves the ring, and you're standing there in confusion for a while, unsure if the game has ended.`
			`	You feel something tap the top of your head, and turn around to see an Arach sitting behind you, "Confused, the human visitor is?" Their little box translates.`
			`	You nod, and they decide to briefly breakdown the competition during this break. "Numerous, the Kimek are, so more athletes, they have," they say. "Tens of thousands, at first enter. Redone, the teams are, once in half, that number is cut."`
			`	They further tell you that once the number of Kimek in the ring reaches two hundred and fifty, the game only stops again once only one hundred remain. That brings you to now, when the hundred enter the ring once again, and are all set to fight individual matches, over some miniature rings drawn on the floor of the main one. This time they all are wearing some sort of goggles over their heads, perhaps as protective gear.`
			`	You find Pairri is set to fight close to where you're sitting, so you get a good view of her fights. While she is short even by Kimek standards, she stands her ground and manages to beat some slightly larger opponents, driving them out of the circular limit of the rink.`
			`	Above the large arena, some monitors depict the fighters and seem to show their score: fighters that lose a match don't leave altogether, instead they rotate counter-clockwise, fighting others to try and climb back up to the winning spots.`
			`	Eventually, after many of these rounds and rotational swap outs, Pairri and her next opponent wait as the other forty-eight finish their own fights, then move to the center of the field.`
			`	"Undefeated, the both of them are," the Arach behind you says. "The floor victor, the winner of this final match will be."`
			`	The whistle sounds again and Pairri charges at her slightly larger opponent, pressuring them and getting them close to the edge. They redirect the force by going to their side, and both start a battle of attrition close to the limits of their rink. Her opponent repositions themself to the middle, and tries to charge at her, but she closes the gap and they start wrestling in the middle. After a while they get back to the border, with Pairri pressing the other Kimek once again, as they get closer and closer to being out of bounds. Suddenly, her opponent manages to grip her with their frontal legs, and by lifting their own body up with the other four, just barely launching her up.`
			`	Pairri falls just outside the ring, and shortly after the other Kimek also falls on their back, touching the ground outside the limiting line. You hear the whistle once again, and as the both of them get up and approach each other for what must be the Kimek equivalent of a handshake, it becomes clear that Pairri lost, considering she touched the ground first.`

			`	You arrive at a massive, stadium-like structure, only it's actually shaped like a half moon. The place overlooks a huge valley, with many small drones flying over it, and transmitting live footage to the dozens of cinema sized screens, for those that can't get a clear view through the glass.`
			`	You notice a structure similar to the starting area seen in horse races, on one of the sides of the track. A few minutes pass, and the massive crowd is in uproar as an alarm sounds, and the doors open: several Saryd leave the structure, having wheeled machines, similar to chariots, attached to them. They are also carrying bows and arrows.`
			`	The race is erratic, the contestants being allowed to take any of the several paths across the increasingly dense forest in the valley, while they attempt to shoot arrows at some projected targets that appear for short periods of a few seconds while they pass close to them. Eventually, you have to turn and look at the massive monitors, as it becomes impossible to follow the race by looking out the window.`
			`	As you turn to look, one of the participants' "chariot" hits one of the trees, and they slow down, eventually coming to a full stop. Although the drones following each Saryd isn't transmitting the sound (the only sounds being voices of who you believe are commentators, though you can't understand their language), it is clear from his overall expression and the way he threw the readied arrow at the ground makes you realize he has probably been disqualified.`
			`	While they move to a more convoluted part of the woods, with several tall brambles and many ledges, the targets start appearing at a progressively faster rate. One of the monitors focuses on one particular racer, who manages to not miss a single shot in a segment with seven different targets in a row. Looking at a smaller, but still massive screen with pictures of the contestants, you see that the picture of this racer rises many positions. It seems that hitting these targets count for gaining points during the race.`
			`	You couldn't count how many there were at the start of the race, due to the sheer number of Saryds and the way they rapidly changed course multiple times during the competition, but as the race approaches its end, and some of the contestants cross a stream serving as the finish line, you manage to identify that there are thirty that made it. The drones end their transmission, as the monitors cut to a group on the ground that starts interviewing the ones that made it.`
			`	After some short statements from the first three arriving contestants, you see that Ulmodi is up next, it seems he arrived in fourth place. You think the entire event is over, as the crowd starts dispersing (again with Heliarch agents overseeing everything), but instead of heading back to the train, they're moving to a separate section of the odd stadium.`
			`	You go with the crowd, and are shown to a room with many elevators. Eventually, everyone descends to the valley below, and follow a path to an actual, full-size stadium, and a massive one at that.`
			`	Awkwardly sitting in the middle of all these alien beings, it hits you that you're probably the first human ever to witness these games. You eye the stadium grounds, oddly it has some small mounds, and six holes: four in the corners, and two across the middle of the longer side of the rectangular grounds.`
			`	Roughly half an hour passes, and a Kimek sitting next to you, who thankfully had a translation device, explains that the contestants are resting. A couple more minutes pass, and the thirty Saryds enter the grounds, and are divided into six teams, each donning a different color, and equipped with what looks like some fancy polo mallets. You see that Ulmodi is on the blue team. Several large spheres are placed at the center of the stadium, with one member of each team around them, forming a circle.`
			`	The game starts, some sort of mix between polo, billiards, and golf. The teams trot around for a while, then rapidly rush to the spheres once they see an opening in the others' defenses. As they hit the spheres with their mallets, they roll around the mounds, curving all over, sometimes even accidentally being flung to the audience.`
			`	Eventually one of them enters one of the holes, which lights up with the color of the team that made the shot: the red team has scored a point. Many of the crowd stand up and a multitude of screams echo across the arena, you're not sure if everyone here is a fan of the red team, or if they all will cheer whenever someone gets a point. The sphere is brought back up automatically via a tube close to the hole, and it's back in the game.`
			`	Points keep rolling in as the teams score goals, with eventually the blue team getting their fifth point. The crowd gets even crazier than before, and the entire blue team comes together and celebrates, while the other five teams aren't quite as enthusiastic. The commentators say something, and the helpful Kimek sitting beside you once again helps you understand it all.`
			`	"The winning score, they have reached! The winners, the blue team are!" They say, still in the cheering mood. After everyone settles down, the members of the teams are shown in the replay screen, going from the team that scored the least, all the way to the blue team at the end. Ulmodi is placed third, which must mean a lot, considering him and the other two above him celebrate by running laps around the inside of the stadium.`
			`	All things said and done, all teams gather together once again, for a moment of comradeship. They leave the arena, and so the crowd starts to leave the stadium.`
			`	You get back to where the train dropped you, and see that the cooperative game train is ready to depart too. The Kimek that spoke to you finds you again, and says farewell as they head into the train leading to the Arachi game.`

As the spectator rafts start passing closer to the top of the tree to see the contestants, you spot Tumub amidst the crowd. He sees you, and stands up higher by stretching his legs, perking his head up to say hi. You also notice that there's a symbol painted on the top of his abdomen, one of the symbols representing an Arach house, with the painting depicting multiple Arach legs, interlocked with each other, as if forming a tightly knit web.`
			`	You are told by the Saryd that it is the symbol for house Debdo, the Arach house that specialises in the service industries. They're about to pinpoint the other symbols and tell you which house each one represents, but a short siren is heard, and the contestants start moving down the main tree. You do your best to follow Tumub's movements, yet shortly after the game begins you lose his position, as the groups of Arach all move rapidly to other trees, holding onto the ropes.`
			`	They spread out to different trees, some ropes leading directly to the top, others attached to the middle or even lower trunk, and then they climb up to the top. Whenever a group is at the top, they start looking in the middle of the leaves, sometimes nearly burrowing themselves in them.`
			`	Eventually some find some shiny, colored rings, which they attach to their legs, and then carry on to other trees, some going for a clockwise route around the main tree, some going counter clockwise, some even going back to the central tree, and then taking another route from there.`
			`	After a couple Arach have already 'cleared' three different treetops, as they struggle to get across the straight rope leading to their fourth, their legs appear to give out, as they fall down to the nets below. You look to the size, seeing that the Heliarchs on the raft are passing a few of the rings to the people here, as if to let everyone see the weight the athletes have to support with each one. When one of them finally gets to you, you hold it with both arms, and still almost let it fall down. The Heliarch explains that they are made similarly to the hulls of Arach ships, so they are incredibly dense, incredibly heavy metals all in one alloy.`
			`	As more and more competitors clear the trees of the needed rings, it becomes clear that one needs to get a ring from each tree to 'pass'. The order at which they approach the trees shows to be part of their strategy, as the ropes leading to sections that require climbing prove to be impossible for those with too many rings. When only thirty Arach remain, they're all at the top of the central tree, having collected all the rings. You see Tumub is amongst them, as the rings are removed and a scoreboard ranks the time each one took: Tumub is placed fifth, tied with another Arachi.`
			`	As a last part of the game, the thirty that passed are presented with heavy suits of armor, brought in by three separate cargo rafts. They all don the bulky suits, and all the rafts with nets leave their positions, getting all in a long, straight line. Two more larger rafts head to the middle, and move apart, revealing a very thin metallic pipe, connected to the both of them. The Arach are brought to the pipe, where they stand still, having to balance themselves on their legs while all the weight of the armor is upon them.`

			`	When the train stops, you find yourself inside a building akin to a spaceport, only the ships are a mix between a helicopter and a raft. Other visitors start getting on the flying platforms, and you go for one of them. The rafts have adjustable seats, their default position being perfect for the Arachi, but moving a few parts makes them capable of accommodate Kimeks and even Saryds. You manage to also get your own seat to be good enough for a human to use.`
			`	Once the 'rafts' are full, they leave their docks and start flying outwards, and as soon as you're outside, you're greeted by a lush rainforest, as you fly beside some massive trees, bird-like creatures with funneled beaks flying to and from them and the carpet of green below. In the distance, you see what appears to be an ocean, but one of the Heliarch agents in charge of the raft says that it's actually a river.`
			`	Getting closer and closer to a spot where multiple of the colossal trees are in close proximity to one another, you arrive at the same time as some slightly smaller rafts, these ones with symbols on their coverings, a different one for each. The Heliarch agents on your own raft are too busy getting the raft positioned, from the looks of it, so you ask a Saryd seated next to you, after noticing they're carrying a translation box.`
			`	"The multiple Arach houses, the symbols they represent," she says. "To be patrons of atheletes, is a custom of members of the great houses."`
			`	The different rafts all start slowly lowering their altitude, getting close to the center of the area with the massive plants. They resemble oak trees, but with leaves many times the usual size, and many vines hanging from the branches, and even extending to other trees.`
			`	When they're finally close enough, you see that the vast majority of the 'vines' are actually ropes, as they connect all trees in a intricate, scattered web. Dozens of medium-sized rafts position themselves under the ropes, four rafts for each, and start moving away from each other, revealing a net connected to both rafts. Finally, one final flying platform comes in, being above everyone else, and having multiple large screens under it, serving as the monitors on which the symbols you saw on the contestants' rafts are shown, and shortly after each one of them, a list of Arachi follows.`
			`	"Damaged, the forest would be, if grand colosseums here were built," the Saryd says. "Those moving sections, every year are prepared. For the games, they are designed."`
			`	The participants' rafts hover near the top of the largest, central tree, and all of them leave, staying at the very top of the crown, as the rafts move away. As the spectator rafts start passing closer to the top of the tree to see the contestants, you spot Tumub amidst the crowd. He sees you, and stands up higher by stretching his legs, perking his head up to say hi. You also notice that there's a symbol painted on the top of his abdomen, one of the symbols representing an Arach house, with the painting depicting multiple Arach legs, interlocked with each other, as if forming a tightly knit web.`
			`	You are told by the Saryd that it is the symbol for house Debdo, the Arach house that specialises in the service industries. They're about to pinpoint the other symbols and tell you which house each one represents, but a short siren is heard, and the contestants start moving down the main tree. You do your best to follow Tumub's movements, yet shortly after the game begins you lose his position, as the groups of Arach all move rapidly to other trees, holding onto the ropes.`
			`	They spread out to different trees, some ropes leading directly to the top, others attached to the middle or even lower trunk, and then they climb up to the top. Whenever a group is at the top, they start looking in the middle of the leaves, sometimes nearly burrowing themselves in them.`
			`	Eventually some find some shiny, colored rings, which they attach to their legs, and then carry on to other trees, some going for a clockwise route around the main tree, some going counter clockwise, some even going back to the central tree, and then taking another route from there.`
			`	After a couple Arach have already 'cleared' three different treetops, as they struggle to get across the straight rope leading to their fourth, their legs appear to give out, as they fall down to the nets below. You look to the size, seeing that the Heliarchs on the raft are passing a few of the rings to the people here, as if to let everyone see the weight the athletes have to support with each one. When one of them finally gets to you, you hold it with both arms, and still almost let it fall down. The Heliarch explains that they are made similarly to the hulls of Arach ships, so they are incredibly dense, incredibly heavy metals all in one alloy.`
			`	As more and more competitors clear the trees of the needed rings, it becomes clear that one needs to get a ring from each tree to 'pass'. The order at which they approach the trees shows to be part of their strategy, as the ropes leading to sections that require climbing prove to be impossible for those with too many rings. When only thirty Arach remain, they're all at the top of the central tree, having collected all the rings. You see Tumub is amongst them, as the rings are removed and a scoreboard ranks the time each one took: Tumub is placed fifth, tied with another Arachi.`
			`	As a last part of the game, the thirty that passed are presented with heavy suits of armor, brought in by three separate cargo rafts. They all don the bulky suits, and all the rafts with nets leave their positions, getting all in a long, straight line. Two more larger rafts head to the middle, and move apart, revealing a very thin metallic pipe, connected to the both of them. The Arach are brought to the pipe, where they stand still, having to balance themselves on their legs while all the weight of the armor is upon them.`

			`	The race is erratic, the contestants being allowed to take any of the several paths across the increasingly dense forest in the valley, while they attempt to shoot arrows at some projected targets that appear for short periods of a few seconds while they pass close to them. Eventually, you have to turn and look at the massive monitors, as it becomes impossible to follow the race by looking out the window.`
			`	As you turn to look, one of the participants' "chariot" hits one of the trees, and they slow down, eventually coming to a full stop. Although the drones following each Saryd isn't transmitting the sound (the only sounds being voices of who you believe are commentators, though you can't understand their language), it is clear from his overall expression and the way he threw the readied arrow at the ground makes you realize he has probably been disqualified.`
			`	While they move to a more convoluted part of the woods, with several tall brambles and many ledges, the targets start appearing at a progressively faster rate. One of the monitors focuses on one particular racer, who manages to not miss a single shot in a segment with seven different targets in a row. Looking at a smaller, but still massive screen with pictures of the contestants, you see that the picture of this racer rises many positions. It seems that hitting these targets count for gaining points during the race.`
			`	You couldn't count how many there were at the start of the race, due to the sheer number of Saryds and the way they rapidly changed course multiple times during the competition, but as the race approaches its end, and some of the contestants cross a stream serving as the finish line, you manage to identify that there are thirty that made it. The drones end their transmission, as the monitors cut to a group on the ground that starts interviewing the ones that made it.`

			`	Awkwardly sitting in the middle of all these alien beings, it hits you that you're probably the first human ever to witness these games. You eye the stadium grounds, oddly it has some small mounds, and six holes: four in the corners, and two across the middle of the longer side of the rectangular grounds.`
			`	Roughly half an hour passes, and a Kimek sitting next to you, who thankfully had a translation device, explains that the contestants are resting. A couple more minutes pass, and the thirty Saryds enter the grounds, and are divided into six teams, each donning a different color, and equipped with what looks like some fancy polo mallets. You see that Ulmodi is on the blue team. Several large spheres are placed at the center of the stadium, with one member of each team around them, forming a circle.`
			`	The game starts, some sort of mix between polo, billiards, and golf. The teams trot around for a while, then rapidly rush to the spheres once they see an opening in the others' defenses. As they hit the spheres with their mallets, they roll around the mounds, curving all over, sometimes even accidentally being flung to the audience.`
			`	Eventually one of them enters one of the holes, which lights up with the color of the team that made the shot: the red team has scored a point. Many of the crowd stand up and a multitude of screams echo across the arena, you're not sure if everyone here is a fan of the red team, or if they all will cheer whenever someone gets a point. The sphere is brought back up automatically via a tube close to the hole, and it's back in the game.`
			`	Points keep rolling in as the teams score goals, with eventually the blue team getting their fifth point. The crowd gets even crazier than before, and the entire blue team comes together and celebrates, while the other five teams aren't quite as enthusiastic. The commentators say something, and the helpful Kimek sitting beside you once again helps you understand it all.`

After everyone settles down, the members of the teams are shown in the replay screen, going from the team that scored the least, all the way to the blue team at the end. Ulmodi is placed third, which must mean a lot, considering him and the other two above him celebrate by running laps around the inside of the stadium.`

Hundreds of Heliarch agents work to keep the nonstop stream of Kimek entering in an orderly fashion, and allocate everyone to their seats.`
			`	You ask one of the agents about the multiple 'floors' and rings, and they say that, due to their high population, the Kimek naturally end up having way more athletes come to the games than the other species, so their own competition is set here, with twenty stadium-floors.`
			`	"To other floors, at any point you may go," they say. "To the elevators, you must go, if to see another floor, you wish."`
			`	You ask them for a way to find out where Pairri will be competing; seeing as you don't really understand any of this, you should at least stick to a floor where someone you know will be participating.`
			`	They point you to a separate group of agents inside, working with many computers and helping the neverending flow of Kimek find their own preferred floors. Eventually, they point you to the sixteenth floor, and you head to the elevators, which are just as packed as the train was. You get to your seat, in the middle of hundreds of Kimek. You see the occasional group of Arach, and the loner Saryds stand tall amidst the crowds waiting for the matches to begin.`
			`	Some extending bridges connect with the ring, and tons of Kimek start gathering on the massive arena. Heliarch agents stay in the middle, as the crowd is divided into two teams. By the looks of it, each team must have several hundred Kimek. The Heliarchs leave, and after a long whistle the two teams charge at one another.`
			`	In the starting seconds, dozens of Kimek fall from the ring, onto the nets on the side, and are helped back to the surrounding seats by several workers. It seems this first stage works like a collective sumo match. After enough have fallen out, another whistle is heard, and everyone stops fighting. Heliarch agents get back on the ring and reorganize those that remain into two teams once again. This time about a minute passes before anyone falls off, the fighters have some actual personal space to work with this time, so they're probably much more comfortable fighting this way.`
			`	This process repeats a few more times, until finally all the ones that remained after everything are gathered in the center of the ring. You estimate that about less than one percent of the ones that first entered. Everyone leaves the ring, and you're standing there in confusion for a while, unsure if the game has ended.`
			`	You feel something tap the top of your head, and turn around to see an Arach sitting behind you, "Confused, the human visitor is?" Their little box translates.`
			`	You nod, and they decide to briefly breakdown the competition during this break. "Numerous, the Kimek are, so more athletes, they have," they say. "Tens of thousands, at first enter. Redone, the teams are, once in half, that number is cut."`
			`	They further tell you that once the number of Kimek in the ring reaches two hundred and fifty, the game only stops again once only one hundred remain. That brings you to now, when the hundred enter the ring once again, and are all set to fight individual matches, over some miniature rings drawn on the floor of the main one. This time they all are wearing some sort of goggles over their heads, perhaps as protective gear.`
			`	You find Pairri is set to fight close to where you're sitting, so you get a good view of her fights. While she is short even by Kimek standards, she stands her ground and manages to beat some slightly larger opponents, driving them out of the circular limit of the rink.`
			`	Above the large arena, some monitors depict the fighters and seem to show their score: fighters that lose a match don't leave altogether, instead they rotate counter-clockwise, fighting others to try and climb back up to the winning spots.`
			`	Eventually, after many of these rounds and rotational swap outs, Pairri and her next opponent wait as the other forty-eight finish their own fights, then move to the center of the field.`
			`	"Undefeated, the both of them are," the Arach behind you says. "The floor victor, the winner of this final match will be."`
			`	The whistle sounds again and Pairri charges at her slightly larger opponent, pressuring them and getting them close to the edge. They redirect the force by going to their side, and both start a battle of attrition close to the limits of their rink. Her opponent repositions themself to the middle, and tries to charge at her, but she closes the gap and they start wrestling in the middle. After a while they get back to the border, with Pairri pressing the other Kimek once again, as they get closer and closer to being out of bounds. Suddenly, her opponent manages to grip her with their frontal legs, and by lifting their own body up with the other four, just barely launching her up.`
			`	Pairri falls just outside the ring, and shortly after the other Kimek also falls on their back, touching the ground outside the limiting line. You hear the whistle once again, and as the both of them get up and approach each other for what must be the Kimek equivalent of a handshake, it becomes clear that Pairri lost, considering she touched the ground first.`
			`	Heliarch agents make sure everyone leaving the floor proceeds in an orderly fashion, and you take the elevators back down, returning to the entrance.

			`	In the starting seconds, dozens of Kimek fall from the ring, onto the nets on the side, and are helped back to the surrounding seats by several workers. It seems this first stage works like a collective sumo match. After enough have fallen out, another whistle is heard, and everyone stops fighting. Heliarch agents get back on the ring and reorganize those that remain into two teams once again. This time about a minute passes before anyone falls off, the fighters have some actual personal space to work with this time, so they're probably much more comfortable fighting this way.`
			`	This process repeats a few more times, until finally all the ones that remained after everything are gathered in the center of the ring. You estimate that about less than one percent of the ones that first entered. Everyone leaves the ring, and you're standing there in confusion for a while, unsure if the game has ended.`
			`	You feel something tap the top of your head, and turn around to see an Arach sitting behind you, "Confused, the human visitor is?" Their little box translates.`
			`	You nod, and they decide to briefly breakdown the competition during this break. "Numerous, the Kimek are, so more athletes, they have," they say. "Tens of thousands, at first enter. Redone, the teams are, once in half, that number is cut."`
			`	They further tell you that once the number of Kimek in the ring reaches two hundred and fifty, the game only stops again once only one hundred remain. That brings you to now, when the hundred enter the ring once again, and are all set to fight individual matches, over some miniature rings drawn on the floor of the main one. This time they all are wearing some sort of goggles over their heads, perhaps as protective gear.`
			`	You find Pairri is set to fight close to where you're sitting, so you get a good view of her fights. While she is short even by Kimek standards, she stands her ground and manages to beat some slightly larger opponents, driving them out of the circular limit of the rink.`
			`	Above the large arena, some monitors depict the fighters and seem to show their score: fighters that lose a match don't leave altogether, instead they rotate counter-clockwise, fighting others to try and climb back up to the winning spots.`
			`	Eventually, after many of these rounds and rotational swap outs, Pairri and her next opponent wait as the other forty-eight finish their own fights, then move to the center of the field.`
			`	"Undefeated, the both of them are," the Arach behind you says. "The floor victor, the winner of this final match will be."`
			`	The whistle sounds again and Pairri charges at her slightly larger opponent, pressuring them and getting them close to the edge. They redirect the force by going to their side, and both start a battle of attrition close to the limits of their rink. Her opponent repositions themself to the middle, and tries to charge at her, but she closes the gap and they start wrestling in the middle. After a while they get back to the border, with Pairri pressing the other Kimek once again, as they get closer and closer to being out of bounds. Suddenly, her opponent manages to grip her with their frontal legs, and by lifting their own body up with the other four, just barely launching her up.`
			`	Pairri falls just outside the ring, and shortly after the other Kimek also falls on their back, touching the ground outside the limiting line. You hear the whistle once again, and as the both of them get up and approach each other for what must be the Kimek equivalent of a handshake, it becomes clear that Pairri lost, considering she touched the ground first.`
			`	Heliarch agents make sure everyone leaving the floor proceeds in an orderly fashion, and you take the elevators back down, returning to the entrance. Once again you see another train, and the Arach that talked to you confirms that it leads to where the cooperative game will take place, just before they board the one leading to the Saryd game.`

			`	You arrive at a massive, stadium-like structure, only it's actually shaped like a half moon. The place overlooks a huge valley, with many small drones flying over it, and transmitting live footage to the dozens of cinema sized screens, for those that can't get a clear view through the glass.`
			`	You notice a structure similar to the starting area seen in horse races, on one of the sides of the track. A few minutes pass, and the massive crowd is in uproar as an alarm sounds, and the doors open: several Saryd leave the structure, having wheeled machines, similar to chariots, attached to them. They are also carrying bows and arrows.`
			`	The race is erratic, the contestants being allowed to take any of the several paths across the increasingly dense forest in the valley, while they attempt to shoot arrows at some projected targets that appear for short periods of a few seconds while they pass close to them. Eventually, you have to turn and look at the massive monitors, as it becomes impossible to follow the race by looking out the window.`
			`	As you turn to look, one of the participants' "chariot" hits one of the trees, and they slow down, eventually coming to a full stop. Although the drones following each Saryd isn't transmitting the sound (the only sounds being voices of who you believe are commentators, though you can't understand their language), it is clear from his overall expression and the way he threw the readied arrow at the ground makes you realize he has probably been disqualified.`
			`	While they move to a more convoluted part of the woods, with several tall brambles and many ledges, the targets start appearing at a progressively faster rate. One of the monitors focuses on one particular racer, who manages to not miss a single shot in a segment with seven different targets in a row. Looking at a smaller, but still massive screen with pictures of the contestants, you see that the picture of this racer rises many positions. It seems that hitting these targets count for gaining points during the race.`
			`	You couldn't count how many there were at the start of the race, due to the sheer number of Saryds and the way they rapidly changed course multiple times during the competition, but as the race approaches its end, and some of the contestants cross a stream serving as the finish line, you manage to identify that there are thirty that made it. The drones end their transmission, as the monitors cut to a group on the ground that starts interviewing the ones that made it.`
			`	After some short statements from the first three arriving contestants, you see that Ulmodi is up next, it seems he arrived in fourth place. You think the entire event is over, as the crowd starts dispersing (again with Heliarch agents overseeing everything), but instead of heading back to the train, they're moving to a separate section of the odd stadium.`
			`	You go with the crowd, and are shown to a room with many elevators. Eventually, everyone descends to the valley below, and follow a path to an actual, full-size stadium, and a massive one at that.`
			`	Awkwardly sitting in the middle of all these alien beings, it hits you that you're probably the first human ever to witness these games. You eye the stadium grounds, oddly it has some small mounds, and six holes: four in the corners, and two across the middle of the longer side of the rectangular grounds.`
			`	Roughly half an hour passes, and a Kimek sitting next to you, who thankfully had a translation device, explains that the contestants are resting. A couple more minutes pass, and the thirty Saryds enter the grounds, and are divided into six teams, each donning a different color, and equipped with what looks like some fancy polo mallets. You see that Ulmodi is on the blue team. Several large spheres are placed at the center of the stadium, with one member of each team around them, forming a circle.`
			`	The game starts, some sort of mix between polo, billiards, and golf. The teams trot around for a while, then rapidly rush to the spheres once they see an opening in the others' defenses. As they hit the spheres with their mallets, they roll around the mounds, curving all over, sometimes even accidentally being flung to the audience.`
			`	Eventually one of them enters one of the holes, which lights up with the color of the team that made the shot: the red team has scored a point. Many of the crowd stand up and a multitude of screams echo across the arena, you're not sure if everyone here is a fan of the red team, or if they all will cheer whenever someone gets a point. The sphere is brought back up automatically via a tube close to the hole, and it's back in the game.`
			`	Points keep rolling in as the teams score goals, with eventually the blue team getting their fifth point. The crowd gets even crazier than before, and the entire blue team comes together and celebrates, while the other five teams aren't quite as enthusiastic. The commentators say something, and the helpful Kimek sitting beside you once again helps you understand it all.`
			`	"The winning score, they have reached! The winners, the blue team are!" They say, still in the cheering mood. After everyone settles down, the members of the teams are shown in the replay screen, going from the team that scored the least, all the way to the blue team at the end. Ulmodi is placed third, which must mean a lot, considering him and the other two above him celebrate by running laps around the inside of the stadium.`
			`	All things said and done, all teams gather together once again, for a moment of comradeship. They leave the arena, and so the crowd starts to leave the stadium.`
			`	You get back to where the train dropped you, and see that the cooperative game train is ready to depart too. The Kimek that spoke to you finds you again, and says farewell as they head into the train leading to the final game.`

			`	Up close, this train is a bit larger than the other ones, and the design appears to mimic that of the Heliarch warships, a mesh of all Coalition styles. It takes you to an area very similar to a spaceport, where you are directed to boarding one of the tens of dozens of ring-shaped flying rafts. Seating down, you notice that the seats, which face the inside of the 'ring', are mobile, as the entire thing can spin around. You can't help but feel uneasy being on a gigantic alien roundabout that doesn't seem to match safety regulations.`

			`	She seems to be about to say something else, but the ring starts moving, taking off and leaving the docks. Out in the open, you're overlooking a massive track, separated from the rest of the wilderness by a perfectly rectangular border of trees. Immediately under you are the contestants, twenty groups of three. As the ring flies higher up, small monitors light up in front of you, and Pairri inputs the proper commands in, so that yours focuses on Tumub's and Ulmodi's group.`
			`	Up above, you can finally see the entire stage: a long, mostly flat stretch of land, leading to a rocky wall, cut to form a perfect right angle with the ground. At the top, there is a river bank, with many logs laid on the ground. The river itself is not terribly big, but the current seems to be potent enough that the boats moving around the waters have some difficulty turning at times.`
			`	The twenty teams line up, with the Saryds in front of a row of chariots, and the other two of each team being on top of said chariot. Zooming in on Tumub, you see that he is helping the Kimek of their group check a bag with some tools, while he himself has one on his back.`
			`	"In many ways we differ, when it comes to physical form," Pairri speaks to you. "Different tasks, each member is assigned. For the sake of fairness, it is so."`
			choice
				`	"What are they carrying in those bags?"`
				`	"So are those chariots for the 'task' of the Saryds?"`
			`	A loud airhorn interrupts Pairri as she is about to answer, and the Saryds start galloping towards the wall. The Kimeks and Arachs of each chariot do their best to stay on, as the alien centaurs give their all to the race.`
			`	After slowing down about two thirds of the way to it, they all arrive at the wall nearly at the same time. The Saryds immediately lay down to rest, as the Arachs unstrap the chariot from their colleagues bodies. Meanwhile, all the Kimeks are already climbing the wall, carrying their small bags.`
			`	The Kimek reach the top relatively quickly, moving up with great speed; once at the top, they open their bags, revealing a multitude of what seem to be carpenter tools, and a lot of rope.`
			`	"To cross the great river, one of the goals of the game is," says Pairri. "For our great agility, us Kimek are known. To build the raft, our task is."`
			`	Back down where the chariots are, the Arachs have started to prepare for a climb, having a large piece of cloth attached to some elastic-like fabric, which they wear over their bodies like some climbing equipment. The Saryds nestle themselves on the cloth, and after a few short test climbs, to see if everything is stable, the Arach start climbing.`
			`	Tumub's movements appear very calculated, never having more than one leg not touching the wall at a time, carefully looking for the best spots to anchor himself on, and continue carrying Ulmodi's much larger frame up the stone barrier.`
			`	As soon as they finish the climb, the Saryds get up, unstrap the fabric from the Arachs, and start carrying their exausted companions toward the now nearly complete raft. The Saryds lay the Arachs beside the raft, and help the Kimeks properly secure the ropes. The Kimeks and Saryds help the Arachs get on, and start pushing the raft to the lake, with the Saryds getting onto them shortly before they touch the water, and the Kimek waiting until the last second.`
			`	After focusing on Ulmodi and Tumub for a while, you notice that the Kimek from their group picked up three small paddles, and is working to fight the river's flow. Ulmodi picks up something that was between some of the logs, that you figured was a part of the boat itself, but turns out to be a thin, long wooden structure, with a mix of a shovel and a pickaxe on one end. Ulmodi uses the pick side to 'hook' some rocks sticking up, and holds as much as he can before letting go, slightly tilting the boat back to the straight course they first started at.`
			`	About halfway across, Tumub gets up, having caught his breath, and heads to the sail. Standing up on two legs, he opens up the sail, and skillfully manages it using the ropes, altering the form of the sail to better adapt to the changing needs of the turbulent vessel.`
			`	As you and Pairri cheer for the group, you notice that not everyone is having the same success at crossing. Two rafts have gone dangerously too far down the river, not being able to fight the stream, and the Heliarch boats head to them at full speed, rescuing the competitors before anything drastic happens.`
			`	In total, eighteen teams have made it across the river, with Ulmodi, Tumub and their Kimek partner winning second place by a hair, seeing as almost everyone arrived at the other margin roughly at the same time. As the competitors themselves celebrate with their own teams, and later gather all together in a large group to also applaud their opponents, the crowd is ecstatic, as praise heard in all three Coalition languages echoes all over.`
			`	Everyone grows quiet, however, as three Heliarch Punishers come down for landing right in front of the athletes. Out come who you assume are the captains of each ship, Heliarchs wearing the same type of circlet you saw in the Ring of Friendship, with each of them being from a different Coalition species.`
			`	"Deemed worthy, some have been. The winners, the Heliarchs shall now announce," Pairri says. As the Heliarchs start speaking she tries to summarize it all and let the box translate it, but the device quickly becomes overwhelmed. Clearly whatever it is that they are saying must be some sort of grand finale speech, judging by the way the crowd responds during the few pauses.`
			`	After they finish, the monitor switches to a black screen, which after a moment lights up with live footage of one of the athletes, a Kimek. Then a Saryd, another Kimek, an Arach. In the end both Tumub's and Ulmodi's faces also show in the monitor, and Pairri does what you think is the Kimek version of an excited scream.`
			`	"Selected, my friends have been!" She says. "Made it, they have!"`
			`	There's a few more words said after everyone has seen the results and settled down, and the six that were selected are invited into the Punishers. Pairri explains that they are being considered to be elevated to the rank of Heliarch, and will go to the Ring of Friendship, to continue their journey to it.`
			`	The ring platforms head back to the building, and as you and Pairri say your goodbyes, you take the train back to the previous arena, and from there to where your ship is docked at.`
