On many Coalition worlds, all three species live together in harmony, which is made easier by the fact that each species prefers a very different climate and thus gravitates to different parts of a planet. They are ruled by individuals known as the Heliarchs.`
		conversation
			`This planet seems to be inhabited by at least three different sentient species. First are giant beetles, about a meter tall, who scurry quickly toward your ship and swarm around it, gawking at you, as soon as you land. The second species, even more disturbing than the beetles, are giant spiders. And the third species are centaurs. Not just something vaguely resembling centaurs; they look like they could have stepped right off the page of a story book from ancient Earth.`
			`	One of the spiders walks up to you, stretching its legs to raise its face and many eyes to the level of your own face, and says something to you in a gloopy sort of burbling language that you don't understand. The beetles, meanwhile, are talking to each other in a different language, all clicks and chittering. And the centaur stands quietly at a distance and keeps glancing back toward the spaceport as if waiting for someone.`
			`	And eventually, someone does arrive: a beetle, a spider, and a centaur all wearing yellow armbands and some sort of electric box hanging on a chain around each of their necks. They walk up to you, and the centaur speaks. After a brief delay, the box around its neck says, "In the name of the Heliarchs, who drove out the oppressors, who maintain peace, we the human visitor greet."`
			choice
				`	"Thank you."`
					goto next
				`	"How do you know my language?"`
			`	The spider speaks, and the box around its neck translates. "Our nearest and most recent neighbor you are. The Heliarchs in their great wisdom, all things that come to pass in our region of space, they are aware of."`
			label next
			`	Speaking through its own translation box, the beetle says, "To the seat of the Heliarch government must you go. Once to the Heliarchs you have become known, in many ways to our society, contribute you may."`
			`	The centaur pulls out a map printed on a thin sheet of plastic. You recognize it as a star map of this region. Lines mark out three different territories, and where they meet are three star systems colored yellow. The centaur points to the southernmost of the three. "Where you must go, here it is," it says.`
			choice
				`	"Thank you. I will go there."`
					goto end
				`	"Can you tell me more about yourselves, first?"`
			`	The spider says, "The wise Heliarchs, all your questions they will answer."`
			label end
			`	Eventually the crowd disperses and allows you to visit the spaceport, although no one offers you any jobs or the opportunity to buy anything but basic commodities. Perhaps you need to register with the "Heliarchs" first.`

Thousands of years ago, the Heliarchs led their three species to band together and drive the Quarg out of Coalition space. The Heliarch centers of government are the three Quarg ringworlds that they captured in that war. They are the only ones in Coalition space who are allowed to have weapons on their starships, and they act as a sort of police force, maintaining peace between the Coalition species.`

But no Quarg are present here, only the three species of the Coalition. Soon after you land, a delegation approaches your ship: again, one of each species, but these are wearing golden circlets around their heads. The circlets are not merely decorative, but seem to contain some electronics as well.`
			`	Again, the centaur speaks first. "To our territory, to welcome you we are glad," it says.`

For six thousand Earth years now, in prosperity and freedom from Quarg constraint and in friendship with each other we have lived."`

"A second Coalition you are forming!" says the centaur, tapping its hooves on the floor in excitement. "Once again, foiled the Quarg are. A secret way for species to work together, they have overlooked. Great things, from this may come."`
			label end
			`	You talk with them for a while longer, and learn that the centaurs are called "Saryds," and are the oldest of the three species. The beetles are the "Kimek," and come next, and the spiders are called "Arachi," and were the last of the three to discover spaceflight.`
			`	They tell you that the best way to learn more about them is to visit their worlds, and to see for yourself how the three species live in friendship and equality. They also offer to give you jobs to do in their territory, so that you may become a "valuable contributor" to their society.`

			`You meet Lugglop in the spaceport and follow him to meet with Nasilor, Alituri, and Pichiie, who are overseeing some workers place a few sealed metal crates inside a container and the yottrite sample you just brought here into another. They detail how they have prepared all the material they needed and now just need a transport to <destination>.`
			`	"If with us, you come, Captain, perhaps a better detailed description of the systems where the yottrite was found, you could provide," Nasilor says.`
			`	"<payment>, I would pay you," Lugglop says.`

			`	"To share our findings with you, allowed we are not," Pichiie says.`
			`	"Forgive us you must, Captain, but told to keep everything a secret, we were," Lugglop continues. "Perhaps after our presentation, public our findings could be made."`
			label accept
			`	They all follow you to your ship after the containers are ready to be loaded.`
			`	After they are put into your cargo, Nasilor, Alituri and Pichiie head to their bunks, but as Lugglop is coming on board, you see that two Heliarch agents, both Kimek, are accompanying him. "Here to ensure the secrecy of our discoveries, they are," he says. Seeing as they are only two more passengers, you agree to carry them to <planet>, and they all board your ship.`

			`Immediately when you land, Lugglop gives you your payment of <payment>. You and the four researchers then follow some Heliarch agents that were waiting for you at the docks. You five are brought to an area akin to a theater with some type of podium on the stage. The seats are all taken by Heliarch agents.`
			`	Lugglop's team apparently will wait until the contents of the two containers are brought here, so you're asked to describe the systems with supernovae where you encountered yottrite asteroids. This only lasts a few minutes, as the audience doesn't seem too keen on inquiring about details, though one particular Saryd did puzzle you when they asked about the state of the supernovas you visited. You tell them you don't know what they mean, and they press the topic no further.`
			`	After you finish, and right as the materials for Lugglop's presentation arrives, you're escorted back to your ship by some agents. Several hours later, you're contacted by Lugglop, who says the presentation is finished, and his group is coming back to your ship. When they arrive, they each thank you for providing the means to perform their experiments. "Officially commended for our efforts, we were!" he says.` 
			`	"Though allowed to publicly share our findings, we are not still, invited to be part of the team here that will continue the research, we were," Pichiie adds. The Saryd twins say they will reside here for as long as the project continues, while Pichiie comments on how she'll often be taking trips to visit her family in House Mallob's property.`
			`	"As for me, a job as overseer, I still have to perform," Lugglop says. "Stay here for a few days I will, but even with all the advanced equipment of this ring, still our Coalition's most capable, the smelters of Bloptab's Furnace are. In their optimal state they must be, if to deepen our knowledge on yottrite, we are. Return there shortly, I will."`
			`	They thank you again for all your help and wish you safe travels as you continue exploring.`
