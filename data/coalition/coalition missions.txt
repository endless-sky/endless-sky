On many Coalition worlds, all three species live together in harmony, which is made easier by the fact that each species prefers a very different climate and thus gravitates to different parts of a planet. They are ruled by individuals known as the Heliarchs.`
		conversation
			`This planet seems to be inhabited by at least three different sentient species. First are giant beetles, about a meter tall, who scurry quickly toward your ship and swarm around it, gawking at you, as soon as you land. The second species, even more disturbing than the beetles, are giant spiders. And the third species are centaurs. Not just something vaguely resembling centaurs; they look like they could have stepped right off the page of a story book from ancient Earth.`
			`	One of the spiders walks up to you, stretching its legs to raise its face and many eyes to the level of your own face, and says something to you in a gloopy sort of burbling language that you don't understand. The beetles, meanwhile, are talking to each other in a different language, all clicks and chittering. And the centaur stands quietly at a distance and keeps glancing back toward the spaceport as if waiting for someone.`
			`	And eventually, someone does arrive: a beetle, a spider, and a centaur all wearing yellow armbands and some sort of electric box hanging on a chain around each of their necks. They walk up to you, and the centaur speaks. After a brief delay, the box around its neck says, "In the name of the Heliarchs, who drove out the oppressors, who maintain peace, we the human visitor greet."`
			choice
				`	"Thank you."`
					goto next
				`	"How do you know my language?"`
			`	The spider speaks, and the box around its neck translates. "Our nearest and most recent neighbor you are. The Heliarchs in their great wisdom, all things that come to pass in our region of space, they are aware of."`
			label next
			`	Speaking through its own translation box, the beetle says, "To the seat of the Heliarch government must you go. Once to the Heliarchs you have become known, in many ways to our society, contribute you may."`
			`	The centaur pulls out a map printed on a thin sheet of plastic. You recognize it as a star map of this region. Lines mark out three different territories, and where they meet are three star systems colored yellow. The centaur points to the southernmost of the three. "Where you must go, here it is," it says.`
			choice
				`	"Thank you. I will go there."`
					goto end
				`	"Can you tell me more about yourselves, first?"`
			`	The spider says, "The wise Heliarchs, all your questions they will answer."`
			label end
			`	Eventually the crowd disperses and allows you to visit the spaceport, although no one offers you any jobs or the opportunity to buy anything but basic commodities. Perhaps you need to register with the "Heliarchs" first.`

Thousands of years ago, the Heliarchs led their three species to band together and drive the Quarg out of Coalition space. The Heliarch centers of government are the three Quarg ringworlds that they captured in that war. They are the only ones in Coalition space who are allowed to have weapons on their starships, and they act as a sort of police force, maintaining peace between the Coalition species.`

			`Your first view of the landing area confirms beyond a doubt that this is a Quarg ringworld, not just an imitation of one. The interior architecture is unmistakable. But no Quarg are present here, only the three species of the Coalition. Soon after you land, a delegation approaches your ship: again, one of each species, but these are wearing golden circlets around their heads. The circlets are not merely decorative, but seem to contain some electronics as well.`
			`	Again, the centaur speaks first. "To our territory, to welcome you we are glad," it says.`

For six thousand Earth years now, in prosperity and freedom from Quarg constraint and in friendship with each other we have lived."`

			`	This, apparently, is news to them. You explain to them who the Hai are, and that some humans have made contact with them and are living in their territory. "A second Coalition you are forming!" says the centaur, tapping its hooves on the floor in excitement. "Once again, foiled the Quarg are. A secret way for species to work together, they have overlooked. Great things, from this may come."`
			label end
			`	You talk with them for a while longer, and learn that the centaurs are called "Saryds," and are the oldest of the three species. The beetles are the "Kimek," and come next, and the spiders are called "Arachi," and were the last of the three to discover spaceflight.`
			`	They tell you that the best way to learn more about them is to visit their worlds, and to see for yourself how the three species live in friendship and equality. They also offer to give you jobs to do in their territory, so that you may become a "valuable contributor" to their society.`

Stepping off of your ship you're greeted by what is unmistakably an outfitter, and as you look around you spot some other large buildings dotting the surrounding area, with members of the Coalition going to and from them. The atmosphere feels like that of a small village turned into an outdoor shopping mall.`
			`	Shortly after landing you're greeted by an Arach wearing what you judge to be some sort of uniform. He takes a translation device out of his pocket and formally greets you. "Honored to have you as a guest, the great House Mallob is, Captain <first> <last>."`

You follow him along the path, and he gives a bit more detail on some of the buildings as you walk near them. What really piques your interest though is that one of the buildings, which he seemed to willingly ignore, had armed guards at the door, with no indication of being members of the Heliarch.`
			`	Reaching the entrance of the mansion, it isn't as castle-like as the walls, but it all still looks strangely pompous. Up close it almost looks like all the several parts and pods of an Arach Hulk or two were crumpled together into one single building.`
			`	He guides you through the mansion. You pass by several other servants, notice rooms where he mentions that members of House Mallob are having meetings, and even meet a group of Saryd and Kimek students who came here to study with the shipwrights of House Mallob.`

It's only when she is nearing a large entrance to the clearing, on the opposite side of where she entered, that she finds the spot, and takes aim.`
			`	She is disrupted when she hears a loud roar and jumps to the ground, narrowly avoiding the beast that had come from behind her. You're unsure how accurate the paper's depiction of the creature is, but you can only describe it as a "hedge-lion": slightly larger than lions from Earth, with various quills where its mane should be. The quills continue in a line on its back, reaching the tip of the tail.`
			`	Having dodged the pounce, the huntress runs past the bird, looking for cover, but the forest isn't dense enough to block the beast's advance. It attacks again, and wounds the top of one of her frontal legs. She kicks it with another leg and readies an arrow, but only manages to scratch its face. The animal gets on its hind legs to swipe down at her but is stunned; the bird has attacked its eyes, blinding it! The huntress is swift to take aim in the opening granted, and an arrow pierces the creature's torso. Once the hedge-lion has fallen, the bird flies away, and the curtains close.`

Flame-shaped folds rain down from the top of the stage and stick to the tree as it falls, blocking the boy's path. He turns to run elsewhere. Another lightning bolt, and another tree falls. After a few more repetitions, the boy is too tired to run anymore. Hurt by some of the flames, he is now limping through the forest.`

He feels a bite, but when he reels it in, there is nothing on the hook. He feels another bite and again finds nothing. Time and again, he looks at the hook to find the bait still there, intact, yet he continues to feel bites, some so powerful even the boat moves a little. The day moves by quickly, with a piece of paper representing the sun moving swiftly from one side of the "sky" to the other.`
			`	Once it is night, the waves grow increasingly stronger, and the Saryd stops fishing altogether. He puts the rod on the boat and tries to steer it back to shore, but he can't find his way. A huge wave that goes beyond the stage's top approaches, and engulfs the boat.`
			`	The fisherman kicks and struggles for air, having lost his boat and still at the mercy of the great waves. The view on the stage starts going down, following the kicks, and something starts rising up to meet the Saryd's legs. As it raises the view back with it, a creature reminiscent of a whale, only with much larger, longer flippers that almost link to its tail, comes to the surface. It rises gently and with care, as if trying to serve as ground for the sailor. Another wave is approaching, large enough to engulf them both, but the whale keeps on going up until it is out of the water.`
			`	As it flies through the night sky, the whale is careful to not drop the Saryd, always waiting for him to find stable footing before turning. For the rest of the night, the whale slowly dances in the sky, and when morning comes and the waves subside, it goes back to the sea and swims close to shore. Once the Saryd is at the beach, he turns back to see the whale's tail hitting the water as it dives deep once again, and the curtains close.`

			`Shortly after entering the spaceport, you observe an Arach in what you guess is a formal "dress," a delicate silk wrap covering most of her body with each leg covered by its own embroidered skirt. She exclaims something loudly into a personal communication device before putting it away with a shove. Like everyone else who has momentarily been witness to this, you go to look away, but the Arach has cast their gaze around, seen you, and immediately begun to approach. "Our honorable human visitor, I salute," she says loudly as she closes the gap. "Say, Captain, appreciate the fine arts, do you? To a cultural soiree, I'm headed, but busy with work, dearest Papa is, so vacant, his reserved seat is. Accompany me, would you?"`

			`	"No simple gathering, but a collection of plays by esteemed professionals, completed by a dedicated orchestra, the soiree is," she explains.

			choice
				`	"Alright, I'm interested. Where is this 'soiree' taking place?"`
				`	"I'm not a fan of plays, sorry."`
					decline
			`	You follow her around the central portion of the city to a building which from the outside looks like some form of auditorium; there, some Arachi in uniform are seeing to the entries of the "patrons" of the event. "A human? Quite an exotic guest you've brought, lady Matlub," one of them says to your guide as she shows him a touchpad displaying two tickets. He verifies them and allows the two of you to enter. The inside reminds you of an opera house, with a large stage in front of dozens of rows of seats, and six levels of balconies on both sides. Matlub leads you to two excellent seats in one of the first few rows, and she helps you "adjust" the chair so that you're more comfortably seated. Just before the stage is an area a few steps below the level of the seats, with a few Arach musicians fine-tuning a variety of instruments. Up on the ceiling, and on all of the balconies, you see small cameras pointed at the stage to broadcast the event for those who didn't have the chance to attend it live.`
			`	As the rows and balconies fill up with more guests, you notice a few Kimek and Saryds amidst the masses of Arachi, most of them accompanying an Arach patron; a few are seemingly patrons themselves, coming in on their own. A great many of them seem to take notice of you as you look around, but your patron studiously ignores the attention.`
			choice
				`	"I can see why you were speaking so highly about this, looks like a really organised event."`
				`	"Not every day that they see a human in one of these, I take it?"`
			`	She nods. "A prestigious event, this is. Bring friends from all around the Coalition to watch, the patrons do. The most unique guest we've had, you are."`
			`	Once all seats are filled, the doors are closed, and an Arach comes to the stage. "Welcome you, esteemed guests, to this celebration of saga and song, our theater does," he says. "Make you wait any longer, I shall not, so for our first play, a timeless classic dear to all, I present: Moonstruck."`
			`	He quickly leaves the stage as the curtains open to reveal a rocky wall with two tunnels leading to the sides. The orchestra begins to play a slow, soft theme on accordion-like instruments, and a young Arach comes into the scene from the tunnel on the left. He hangs onto the rocky wall, a small lantern hanging from his abdomen and a large sack strapped to his back. The Arach then picks rocks from the corners of the wall, throwing most to the ground but placing a few inside the sack he carries. Once the sack is full, he enters the tunnel on the right, and the rocky wall is rotated to show the other side; there, the young miner is shown under the night sky smelting the ore he collected. As he looks to the top of the stage with his back facing the audience, the accordions grow quieter, a slow harp starts to play, and a full moon comes into view at the top of the background sky.`
			`	The curtains close as the scene changes, opening again with the accordions picking up the pace. The Arach is now on a larger wall with only one tunnel from above. He claws away at the rocky corners, the accordions following his rhythm. Once he's dug out most of the ore, the wall starts shaking, as if the mine were collapsing. The accordions become erratic as he rushes for the escape tunnel. With a hectic clamor, the rock wall appears to disassemble on stage with great boulders descending gracefully from the fly tower, caving in the mine. The accordions stop, but after a long pause they, along with the harp, slowly pick up again. The young Arach then climbs into view and pushes first one boulder away, and then another, and another. This goes on until the Arach stands atop a mountain of metal carved out of the rock, reaching for the moon. As he nearly touches it, the curtains close and the music stops.`
			`	The Arachi in the audience rub two of their legs together, as if clapping at the end of the performance. Shortly after, some get up, heading to the exit as the doors open up once again. At the same time, more patrons are coming in to fill the vacant seats. "Interested in only some of the plays, some patrons are, so only for those they wish to see, they stay," Matlub explains. "Leave after any of the performances, you may, if someplace else, you must be, but remain for the rest of the show, I will."`

			`	Once everyone is seated, the same Arach from before goes to the stage again. "A surprise for you, tonight we have. A brand new play, an anonymous group of patrons commissioned. As a critique of one of the issues that persist in our society, described it is. For our second play: Babbling Bebliss."`
			`	As he leaves, the curtains open to a set of an Arach street, where a child is purchasing some form of candy. From behind a building in the set, an Arach wearing tall, blue and white "socks" emerges as trumpets and tubas start playing an obnoxious track. He runs for the child and knocks the candy to the ground as he makes some gargling sound. Matlub sighs, saying, "Gibberish, it is. Nonsense, and words best left untranslated." The Arach actor goes on to cling to the walls of the building and grab things from inside the candy shop, throwing them wildly. By now, many well dressed patrons, most likely members of House Bebliss, are getting up and leaving the theater. Meanwhile, a group of Arachi on one of the balconies doesn't even try to muffle their laughter.`
			`	The scene continues as a couple comes to the set, walking down the street. As they're about to lean in for what looks like a kiss, the Arach leaps from the building, landing on the bachelor with a thud. He steals the kiss, as the tubas and trumpets blast as loudly as they can. After a while, the authorities show up, only for the Arach to make a run for it down the street. The orchestra plays a tune that is as uncoordinated as his movements, and the curtains close. Not many in the audience manifest themselves, most sighing or getting ready to leave, save for the group that was laughing earlier who are now very vocal in announcing their appreciation for the play. "Know of subtlety, House Chamgar does not," Matlub says. "A shame it is, that tainted the soiree with this rivalry, they have."`
			`	The doors open once again as new patrons cycle in to watch the third play.`

			`	Everyone takes their seats, and the Arach announcer heads to the stage again. "A cathartic tragedy, our third play of this evening is. For our next performance: 'Til Death."`
			`	The stage lights go dark as the curtains open to a single spotlight. It illuminates an old Arach getting dressed inside a small shack on the right side of the stage. He coughs, and something akin to an organ begins to play a melancholic melody. Once he leaves, the shack is left in the dark as the spotlight follows him to the middle of the stage, where he makes his way carefully down an empty street. He is allowed to pass beyond the spotlight, which goes dark as the perspective shifts and a second spotlight renews the focus. The left side of the stage is finally lit up, where the Arach starts tending to a garden by the entrance of a manor. The organ stops its weeping every once in a while, right when the Arach is coughing, only to resume once he's done. Leaving the manor, a richly dressed Arach points to one of the flowers in the garden, showing it to be shriveled and dead. He plucks it and throws it to the ground before leaving. The gardener picks up the flower, sticks it inside his clothes, and continues his work.`
			`	Once his work is done, he heads back to his shack, the spotlights following him as he moves around the stage. Once inside, he looks inside a small box, taking a simple vase and placing the flower inside it. The stage goes dark as he goes to sleep and the piano stops, with only the occasional cough echoing throughout the theater. When the light comes to the shack again, the Arach slowly gets up and again leaves for his job, pausing for a moment on the street part of the stage during a heavy coughing fit. Once he's done with the work and begins going back home, he starts coughing again, not letting up for more than a second at a time. During this the spotlights transition to the next section of the stage, and the piano plays a brief note. Once inside his shack, he collapses, knocking down the flower vase in the process. The piano plays a few slow chords, and the last spotlight goes out during the final note.`
			`	You hear the curtains closing, and the lights of the theater turn back on again as the audience is taken by a round of applause. Once they've settled, the announcer goes up to the stage again. "And with that, concluded, our soiree is. Thank you all for gracing us with your presence, I, in name of the theater, do." He lowers his head in a bow and leaves the stage again as nearly all of the patrons in the audience get up and head for the exit, this time with nobody else coming in to take their seats. At the same time, the orchestra starts packing up their instruments. There are, however, a few who remain in their seats, including Matlub.`

			`	The theater workers leave one after the other, leaving you and the other guests with an empty stage. After a while, the lights are turned off. A couple minutes later, however, you hear the curtains open, as some violins start to play in unison. Their music doesn't come from where the orchestra was seated, but as if they were all over the theater, behind you and even up on the balconies. A strong light comes from the stage, most of it blocked by a tall, dark figure. It isn't an actor, however, instead seeming to be made out of wooden parts kept up by thin wires you can barely spot when looking at the top of the stage. The violins' song is disrupted by dull, successive drum hits, at which point the figure moves, with its "arms" opening to the sides; it becomes even taller as it stands up. It is a humanoid creature, and it begins to slowly move around the stage, as if dancing in a pendulum. Cellos join in with the violin screams, and are followed by a choir, though you cannot understand their words. You do recognize, however, that it isn't being sung in any language of the Coalition.`
			`	The creature appears to get closer to the audience, growing in size, and as the choir and instruments become more intense, it swings one of its arms upward and removes the wires. Despite this, it stays upright and continues to move. It brings both arms close and strikes its own head to form two small holes which the background light shines through. Then, it falls to its knees, with one arm reaching for the audience, as the light behind it turns off and the choir and music subside.`
			`	The lights turn back on, revealing curtains still open, but nothing on the stage. A few workers come in to tidy up the place, and the remaining guests now get up to leave.

			`	You follow the Kimek for a while longer until he finds you a pairing of camp and fort that have a vacant spot in either side. "Well Captain, choose a side to play as, you must. The hang of it, you will get, once started, the event has, but as a quick summary, take the 'crops' inside the fort before time runs out, the attacking team must. Prevent them from doing that, the defenders must. At the end, rewarded, the victors are."`

			`	He chitters, as if expecting the question. "Witnessed by a minstrel, the battle was. Traveling on fields like these, he was, before the fort and the raider camp, he spotted in the distance. Hid himself in foliage close to the scene, he had, and writing and painting it as it happened, he was. When reached its climax, the battle had, swept up by the wind, many flowers were, and block his vision they did. Once settled down the wind had, over, the battle was. Spring it was, so 'Spring Siege' became the story's title."`
			`	Seeing you have more questions now, he continues. "Silly and nonsensical at times, the story is. Know that, we do, and that simply looking to entertain a crowd, the minstrel was, but with all forms of classic tales, is that not the case?" He chitters some more, and looks at the group up on the hill and the other in the camp, before continuing. "Foreign as it might seem, participate in it, will you not? Perhaps like it, you might."`

			`	He brings you to the small fort up the hill. Its gates open as those inside (mostly Kimek as expected, but also a couple Arachi and a lone Saryd) are still getting ready. A small "farm" sits in the middle, with plastic replicas serving as the crops. The walls of the fort are made of various tall logs, densely covered by tufts of vicious, reddish thorns nearly as long as your arm. Inside, you can see that a higher level with battlements is accessible via staircases on either side of the courtyard; you also notice that the defenders are all wearing a green strip of cloth over their clothing. Another Kimek organizer, wearing a rugged leather vest that you assume is the Kimek equivalent of medieval armor, comes to meet you both at the gate. He greets his colleague, who introduces you and says that you have chosen to join the defenders, before heading back down the hill.`
			`	"Glad to have you as part of the garrison, our fort is," the armored Kimek begins. "Told about the enemy's objective, I assume you have been. Protect our farm, we must, so allow the produce to be stolen, we cannot." He tells you to follow him to the "keep," a shack too small for any non-Kimek, and gives you a long piece of green cloth. He then informs you that it is meant to be worn, so that others can tell what team you are on. As you wrap it around you like a scarf, you notice that, behind the shack, there is a smaller gate that grants entry to the fort. Once you're done, he gives you a brief tour of the rest of the fort, taking you up the battlements and above the main gate, where you see buckets of what at first appears to be water. Your guide informs you that the liquid inside is actually quite slick, and during the re-enactment, it is poured downhill to slow the attackers.`
			`	Once he's done, he tells you to wait in the courtyard, as the "battle" will begin soon. A few minutes pass before a loud whistle blows, and the Kimek in charge of the fort tells everyone that the other side has begun their attack. The front gate is closed, and some of the defenders begin placing heavy objects behind to barricade it; others are already up by the battlements, waiting for the right time to use the buckets of slippery liquid.`

Some Kimek take logs they find stashed under a staircase and bring them as well, burying one end in the ground with the other end against the door. The liquid poured on the attackers does slow them down for some minutes, but once you're done, they're already banging at the gate. Most of those inside the fort, particularly the Saryd that has joined in, head to the main gate to try and keep it closed, but a few Kimek head around the back to check on the smaller gate.`

Sure enough, you hear scuttling Kimek legs swishing through the grass as the attackers come circling around. Fortunately, not many came to this gate, so, with your help, your Kimek teammates don't have much trouble keeping the gate closed. Thanks to the main gate having been reinforced, the group there holds well enough that some more come to the back to help, and after some minutes of struggling with the attackers on the gate, another whistle is sounded. It marks that time has run out and that the defenders have won.`

The whistle sounds again, marking the end of the battle and the victory of the attackers.`

			`	You go up the stairs and are given one of the buckets with the slippery substance. You notice that the others up here are all Kimek and Arachi, however, and they are only pouring the liquid down directly in front of the gate. When you see some of the blue sash wearing attackers advancing from the sides, where the liquid hasn't been poured, you chuck a bucket their way. This leaves a line of the liquid on that side, and those attacking from there lose their footing, tripping and falling again and again. Once your teammates realize what you've done, they begin to egg you on, encouraging you to throw more buckets to cover the sides while they continue to drench the middle. Despite your efforts, however, the attackers do eventually make it up the hill and start banging at the gate. Most of those inside the fort, including the Saryd, head to the main gate to try and keep it closed, but some Kimek instead head around the back to check on the smaller gate.`

			`	He brings you to the nearby camp, where many Kimek, Arachi, and even a few Saryds are gathered for the event. Most of them are waiting in anticipation inside one of the tents, or looking up at the fort; all of them have long, blue strips of cloth over their own clothing. Once she notices you two, another Kimek organizer, donning what looks like a thin gambeson, comes to say hello. She greets her colleague, who then introduces you and tells her you have chosen to join the attackers, before leaving the camp to welcome a family who has come to watch the event.`
			`	"Honored to have you fight alongside us, our company is," the armored Kimek begins. "Told about our objective, I assume you have been. Break into the fort, we must, before up the time is. Ten minutes, we have, once started, the battle has." She tells you to follow her to the "war tent," one that's slightly larger than the others around it. There she gives you a long piece of blue cloth and informs you that it is meant to be worn so that others can tell what team you are on. Wrapping it around your neck like a scarf while you look around the main tent, you see that there is a stumpy log reinforced with metal bits stored here, which the Kimek tells you will be used as a battering ram to force open the gates. She then has you follow her to the edge of the camp to show you the limits of this "set," which is marked by patches of vegetation meant to indicate the boundaries of the game. "Also, discourage anyone from trying it, the thorns should, but against the rules, it is, to crawl up the walls of the fort, so-" She pauses, looking at you as if just realizing that such a thing is impossible for you. "Sorry, out of habit, I said it. Participate in this event, not many groundlocked people do; few Saryds here I've met. Even fewer humans, as imagine, you can."`
			`	Once she's done, she says you're free to roam the camp as you wait for the "battle" to begin. A few minutes pass before a loud whistle blows, and the Kimek in charge of the camp tells everyone that the time has come. She leads the charge up the hill, with most of those from the camp following her.

Once you get closer, however, you see the defenders, garbed in strips of green cloth as opposed to your blue, pouring out buckets of what looks like water. As it flows down the hill to meet your steps, though, you immediately lose your balance and your feet slip out from under you, and you slide a short distance back down the hill. You get up, but, try it as you may, you cannot find stable footing in the wet grass, instead having to step on the few tufts that have grown too high for the liquid to cover them. Even with all their legs, the Kimek and Saryds fare no better, and find themselves in similar trouble, losing their balance again and again. Only the Arachi can press onward, digging down into the dirt beneath the grass with half their legs at each step. They slowly but surely help you and the others move up, and eventually you reach the gate, only to find that the groups that came from the sides are already working on busting it open. You can also see what the Kimek meant when she spoke of "thorns;" tufts of vicious, reddish barbs nearly as long as your arm cover the logs that make up the walls.`

They take turns with each others when one gets tired so that someone is always pushing, even though their attempts aren't the most effective. After a while, you hear a cracking noise, and the gate finally begins budging slightly, as if something barricading it had broken off. As the latecomers of the main force come up, bringing with them the battering ram, everyone makes way for them to begin hammering it against the gate. The gate shudders with each hit and gradually begins to give even more, but even the battering ram team cannot break through fast enough as the whistle from the start of the event sounds again. Evidently this means that time has run out, and the defenders have won.`

Once they realize the vulnerability of this gate, the Saryds in the group ask others to move out of the way. You are a bit startled as they suddenly charge it in unison, almost forcing it open with a single concerted effort. More defenders come to hold it, though, and the gate becomes increasingly difficult to move any further. One Arach heads back to the main group to call for more help, but when they arrive, so do more defenders.

You reach the top while the main force still struggles, and your group makes its way to the gate. On your way, you see what the Kimek meant when she spoke of "thorns," with closely-spaced tufts of vicious, reddish barbs nearly as long as your arm covering the logs that make up the walls.

		conversation
			`You're window-browsing a shop in the spaceport when you catch the scuff of too quick footsteps coming towards you. Before you can glance in that direction, you're suddenly tackled into the ground by someone astonishingly human-shaped. You try to get up, but whoever attacked you pins you down, pressing your face into the ground and holding your arms behind your back to restrain you. As you struggle against your attacker you manage to catch sight of long hair and then, with a flash of concern, a glimpse of green skin - an Alpha.`
			`	You are not pressed for long though. You feel the Alpha's attention shift to the side you cannot see, as an Arach swoops in with a tackle. The Alpha lets go of your arms in an attempt to block the attack, but it does not prevent the Arach from bowling them clear off of you where the two begin to wrestle in your line of sight. The Alpha is a man and, surprisingly to you, despite his strength, it doesn't take long for the Arach Heliarch to restrain your attacker. The Arach firmly pins his arms to his torso with four legs, holds his hips down with two, and uses her last pair to lever herself until she rests her entire body weight into pinning the Alpha.`
			`	A Saryd Heliarch approaches and tells you to keep your distance before interposing himself partially between you and your assailant. He then looks at the Alpha and asks through his translator box, "What reason for attacking this person, did you have?"`
			`	The Alpha is still struggling to try and get out of the Arach's grip, and you notice an intricate gold necklace which has splayed across his shoulder and onto the floor in the scuffle, jangling in the quiet every time he struggles. At this point, everyone else has cleared out of the area and is giving the scene a wide berth. As you get to your feet he ignores the Saryd's question and looks at you intensely. "You're with the Navy, aren't you? Finally figured out I was here, thought you'd finish the job?"`

				goto detained
			label notnavy
			`	He stares at you for a moment, as if unsure if you're telling the truth. "What the hell are you doing here then? Did you just stumble onto this place?" He stops struggling, but the Arach agent doesn't loosen her grip.`
			label detained
			`	The Saryd walks closer to the Alpha, stomping his hoofs on the ground with each step. "Whatever your motivation was, a transgression, you have committed. Punished accordingly, you shall be," he says. "Kindly follow us to the detention facility, would you, Captain?" he asks you, but doesn't wait for an answer, as more agents arrive to escort you and the Alpha to the "detention facility."`
			`	On your way there, you start feeling stings on your arms and legs, and realize the Alpha's tackle left you with some bruises. "Treat those, we will, after faced trial, your agressor has," the Saryd says as you approach your destination: a building similar to a police station. The Alpha is brought before a Kimek that you guess is in charge of the facility. He asks you to give a testimony of what happened, with the Heliarch agents confirming what you say. "Your first offense in a long time this is, Alitis," the Kimek says, after checking a computer for the Alpha's data. "Three years in seclusion, your sentence is."`
			`	After the short verdict, which seems to lack much of the due process you would expect in human space, the agents bring both you and the Alpha to a lower level of the building. This floor has several empty cells kept shut by thick, tough walls of some transparent material. While the cell block does appear to go further beyond this section and around a corner, the first few cells appear to be directly opposite a modest medical space, presumably used mostly for treating any injured prisoners without leaving the secure level. At present though, all of the cells appear to be empty, and the Heliarchs simply lock him in the second cell, where accessing his would not obstruct any other doorways. The agents then ask that you wait a few minutes for a medic to arrive so that they can take care of your bruises.`
			`	You notice that cut into the transparent material of the walls are a series of small holes at head-height with a cover that can be slid across them, presumably to silence a prisoner if needed. By default, they appear to be left open, and the Heliarch agents have not closed the one on the Alpha's cell.`
			`	Your eyes shift from the holes in the wall to the Alpha to find his eyes fixated on you, not looking away or even blinking. After you stare him down for a couple of seconds, he speaks up. "What is it, are you expecting some sort of apology? I'd consider my caution to be entirely justified, so you won't get one."`
			choice
				`	"Who are you? How did you even get here?"`
				`	"What are you doing here in the Coalition?"`
			`	He frowns at you. "I don't owe you any answers, cur. Shut up and wait for the law to bring the frail princess some band-aids and a lollipop."`
			choice
				`	"Are you so busy in that empty cell that you can't answer me?"`
				`	"Tough talk for someone who wrestled a spider and lost."`
			`	He leans forward, his legs twitching as if stopped mid-tackle, and he pauses, turning to look down the hallway to where the Heliarchs went. He backs up, slowing his breathing, and then sits down. "Alright. This may be the last time in three years I can have a proper conversation, so I will entertain you. My name... is Alitis. Over a century ago my kin stumbled upon an alien civilization beyond the Far North in conflict with bands of invaders. These invaders possessed drive capable of jumping between systems without the need for hyperspace links, technology that we greatly desired, for it could put us far outside of the reach of... you." He fixates his eyes on yours, ever so slightly closing his eyelids. "We explored the far reaches of the galaxy to the east, but found no place to call home. Our only choice was to return to the Dirt Belt where we knew of an enclave of more kin, only for the Navy," he spits on the ground, then looks at you again, "to find us. We evacuated, and my kin thought it wise to return to the east, but I knew better. I stole one of the drives my kin had along with a small ship and began traveling west. That is when I discovered the Coalition, and they have provided for me a home that I have been unable to find elsewhere in the galaxy."`
			choice
				`	"You 'knew better?' What do you mean?"`
				`	"What, did you have a change of heart once you got here?"`
			`	He gets up in a rush. "Full of questions, aren't you?" He approaches the wall again, in slow steps. "I was among the first of my kind. Athis, I was called then. I have traveled the galaxy for many centuries and witnessed many things. I have been ambushed, cornered many times; fear was not a stranger to me, for as soulless as your kind see me, we still feel. But when I traveled to the east, someone, or... something, rather, spoke to me. A voice with an immense weight. And for the first time, I felt something more than fear. I felt dread. So when my kin decided to return to the east, I was not so inclined to return with them."`
			choice
				`	"Voices in your head? Are you sure you weren't just imagining them?"`
					goto imaginary
				`	"What did the voice say?"`
			`	He looks away from you. "You're here now, aren't you? This means you must have a device to jump beyond links as I did. Travel to the east and find out for yourself what the voices say. Find out if it classifies you as 'disposable' as well.`
				goto end
			label imaginary
			`	He looks away from you. "No imaginary thing could have such an impact on me. You're here now, aren't you? This means you must have a device to jump beyond links as I did. Travel to the east and find out for yourself that the voices are real."`
			label end
			`	The Heliarchs inform you that the medic has arrived, and bring you further down the hallway to a room where they treat your bruises. They examine you briefly, then give you a tube with a thick liquid, almost like a gel, asking that you gently apply it on your wounds. Once you're done, they tell you that the pain should wear off within a few minutes, and an agent escorts you back out. Passing by his cell again, you see Alitis still standing with his back to the hallway, looking straight at the wall. The agent brings you to your ship, and thanks you for your cooperation.`

Strangely enough, you see him cite human news broadcasts and television shows as if they were academic papers. All of the broadcasts are hundreds of years out of date. Viewing your own society from the outside feels surreal.`
			`	The seminar goes on for some time. A Saryd gives a suprisingly accurate lecture on the human body. An Arach goes into detail explaining the technological level of human ships. There are even occasional speeches given on supposed aliens to the east and north. Seeing as they have no direct evidence, however, the scientists can do little more than speculate.

Captains and workers that pass by give you all sorts of looks, and after a few minutes even some Heliarch agents are gawking at you, discussing among themselves.

Dozens of searchlights are dotted along the edges, lighting the ground below, while a warehouse complex sits at the center of the plateau top. As you're approaching the plateau, your ship's sensors alert you to incoming vessels; you look at your radar to see a Saryd Sojourner, followed by three Travelers, getting closer to your ship. They appear unarmed, but as you land on the plateau and they follow you down, defensive turrets on the edges of the complex remain locked onto them.`

Once you're all out of your ship, you see the Saryd has been stopped by a trio of Arach guards, clad in winter uniforms and blocking the his path. "Told mother or father about this, have you?" he shouts at Sedlitaris as she walks closer. "Because important enough to be told, I apparently am not. That out to die you were, told I was by some Kimek arbiter that met, I never had!"`

"Permission to leave, you have, but obligated to do so, you aren't. Quit, you still can. Leave the ranks, you could, and work with me. Give you my own ship, I will. Like that, would you not?

			`Coming down to <origin>, Sedlitaris checks for the coordinates where the ancient Saryd stop is, passing the data to your ship's systems. It brings you to a mesa on the desert, with a wide ravine-like opening on top. You land close to a small opening on the mesa walls leading into the ravine, and follow Sedlitaris into it, helping her bring the pylon inside. About halfway to the end, she points to another hole in the walls. "Past there, the pylons of previous expeditions should be. Find the one Mimodum left here, we must. A physical connection with the one we brought, for this first one we'll need. 'Wake up' the other ones his expedition left, it will, and enough battery for easier access to the data in those, they should have."`
			`	She carries the pylon inside as you light the way. After some short minutes inside the tunnel dug into the mesa walls, you reach the end: a room carefully carved out, with ten objects similar to the pylon Sedlitaris carried there, though four are of very different design, being closer to a beige, blocky obelisk. She puts down the pylon, and asks that you shine a light on it so that she can configure it. Then, she begins to tinker with some wires connected to a panel on the lower half of the pylon. "To determine which one of these is the most recent, send a signal in its frequency, I will."`

Failures due to the great distance to Saryd space, and difficulty in getting supplies, they were. Because of that, once leaving initial expedition logs in this world, we began, bothered to create proper infrastructure, my predecessors didn't."

			`	Once she's done with the wires, she pushes a button and a humming beep comes from one of the machines with the same, spiralling design. "That one, it is," she says, and asks that you help her move her pylon close to the one that emitted the sound. She connects the two with cables by the base of each pylon; the older pylon clicks on after a moment, letting out several beeps in a short chant. "Enough energy to transfer its data now, it should have."`
			`	A few seconds pass, and another hum comes. She looks at a small screen on the panel, and confirms that the data's all safe.

You fly your ship southward, and she asks that you stop halfway to the pole. She inputs commands again, and another beep comes. "Passed it, we have. Determine its exact position, we must. Little battery for these countersignals, the pylons have." You fly northeast, and then straight west, with her emitting a signal each time your ship stops.`
			`	After you've triangulated the pylon's coordinates, you fly down to a glacier and land on a spot that looks stable enough to handle the weight of your ship. Sedlitaris says the pylon must have gotten covered in the ice due to glacial melting and refreezing, though that doesn't seem to have damaged its systems; she accesses the data remotely after tinkering with the pylon in your ship for a while.`
			`	Once it's done, she plays the log recording the expedition had for this planet: "Log started. Developing as expected, this world is, and apparently still untouched, it remains. Too cold for non-Saryd residents, it is, but with some terraforming efforts, a comfortable enough base for Kimek and Arachi agents alike, it could be.

			`Sedlitaris starts triangulating to find the next pylon again, and brings you to a tall mountain where some of the local dragons appear to have made some form of nest or breeding ground. You do your best to avoid them as you fly around the mountain, and Sedlitaris continues to send signals to find the pylon.`
			`	"Difficult to believe it, I find, that anyone would attempt to dig in a home to the dragons, but maybe inside the mountain, it is. From there, the countersignals are coming." She stops for a few minutes, and looks at the view of the mountain on your monitors. She tries again, and asks that you get closer. When you're finishing yet another lap, she asks that you stop your ship, keeping it steady in the air. "Zoom your cameras here, could you, Captain?" she asks, pointing to the middle of a monitor. You zoom in and see a circle of large rocks, surrounded by dragon nests. Atop the rocks are some patches of foliage, and in the middle lies a small, dark, tower-like structure, stuck in the rocks by one end. After looking at it for a few seconds, it clicks for the two of you that it's an upside-down pylon. "Taken it as some form of token, the dragons must have," Sedlitaris says. "Hopes of retrieving some of the pylons physically, I had, but prefer to dig out the glacier for the previous one than test my luck against the dragons, I do. Unlock this one's data remotely, I will."`

Scoured the planet with our searches, we have, but no trace of the previously visited ruins, or any other sign of the group that lived here, we found. Assured me that all our ships' navigation systems are working properly, the engineers have, but at the coordinates where they should be, the ruins are not, as if they had never been there. A confusing disappointment, this was, but continue with the mission, we must. Heading far north, to Summit, we are. The last point before regrouping with the split group, it will be."`

				`	"Did they ever find any member of that species?"`
				`	"They couldn't find out anything more? Just some jetpacks with pockets?"`

Asked the Quarg about the findings, the Saryds had, but to their surprise they acted as if there was nothing here. For the time, very odd of them to do that, it was."

You spend the next few hours retelling what you saw, and helping her search what information humans have gotten on the Sheragi and their ruins since Foster published his initial findings.`

			`You fly around the moon as Sedlitaris nails down the coordinates of the pylon, until you land close to one of the forests. "Deeper inside, the pylon must be. Uninhabited by humans this world is, correct?" You confirm it, and she prepares to leave. "No dragons to worry about here, there are, so try to bring back this pylon with us, I will."`
			`	You two leave your ship and enter the forest, taking turns carrying the pylon you brought, which is easy enough to do since the gravity is so much lower here. Occasionally Sedlitaris stops and has the pylon put down so that she can determine where to go next. Eventually, you notice the trees start getting smaller as you move on, until you reach a wide, odd clearing where the ground is devoid of any of the local flora. Sedlitaris spots the other pylon on the opposite side, half stuck in the ground, and moves to pull it out. As you follow her to the machine, you notice deep, perfectly straight holes in the ground, forming lines that sometimes cross the entire clearing and continue well past it. Soil and dust have filled most of them up, but in certain gaps you can look down to cracks that must be dozens of meters deep.`
			`	Sedlitaris ties a rope around the end of the pylon that's visible and pulls it, forcing up the dirt as she brings the rest of the device to surface. She connects it with the pylon you brought, and accesses the data from there. "Much more active here, the expedition was," she says. "Three recordings, there are. Bring these back to your ship, we should, listen to the first one there, we can."`
			`	Both of you carrying a pylon, you make your way out of the forest and back to your ship, where Sedlitaris immediately plays the oldest entry: "Log started. Sent two Punishers further north, I have, but returned yet, they have not. As for the crimson anomaly on the nearby western system, still unresponsive, it is. A reaction from it, nothing got, be it a Finisher barrage or attempting to ram it. A simple nebula, the researchers claim it is not, think that we are missing something, they do. Wait a few more days for the Punishers to return, I will. In the meantime, back to that system, I will go. Maybe learn something about the anomaly, we can."`
			`	After Mimodum's voice has disappeared, Sedlitaris urges you to take off. "Heard of this 'anomaly' before, I had not. Look for the system it's in, at once we must. Hopefully still there after the centuries, it is."`

Made it back to the system, one of the Punishers that headed north must have, some debris pieces were floating about when return to the system, we did. Take off, the rest of those, on Summit, couldn't. The ground is..." the static returns, this time sharing space with some scratch-like stops.

			`	"Yes," she says. "Recovered as much information as I wished to, I could not, but prepared a report on what me and Captain <last> found, I have. Additionally, recovered two of the pylons Mimodum left, we have."`
			`	One of the consuls adresses you, "Tell us, Captain, run into any er... complications during the trip, have you? Maybe occasioned by the tribune - the inspector - being with you?"`

				`	"She stayed inside my ship whenever there was a risk of humans seeing her, if that's what you're asking."`
				`	"I didn't notice anything out of the usual, no."`
			`	They call for some agents to get the pylons out of your ship, and transport them to somewhere Sedlitaris can present her findings. As they tell her to follow them to the room where the presentation will happen, a Kimek Heliarch breaks through the line of agents keeping the crowd back. You recognize him as arbiter Kicharri, who you met just before Sedlitaris received approval from the Heliarch council.`
			`	"What is this?" The Saryd consul steps in front of Kicharri as he approaches. "Arbiter, shared with you in due time, the findings will be, but the inspector's report to us consuls, the priority is, so return to your duties you-"`
			`	"No, meet with her family, she will," Kicharri interrupts him. "Heard nothing but hell from her brother, I have. Devastated, her parents were. Now that returned, she has, see them and calm their worries, she will."`
			`	"By whose orders?" An Arach consul jumps in. "Intrigued by her findings, we all are, and listen to her at once, we must."`
			`	"Orders?" Kicharri exclaims. "Orders for her to leave and die, you thought you had given her!" Kicharri looks at Sedlitaris, then back at the consuls. "If so intrigued you are, surely to miss out on any information, you don't want. Best suited for giving a full report, she will be, once rested from her expedition, she has."`
			`	Irked by his response, the consuls have the agents clear the area, and have your ship made into a makeshift meeting room for a while, making everyone get out while they head inside to discuss. After many minutes, they come back out, and one of the Kimek says, "Ten days of leave you will be given, tribune. After that, present us your findings, you must. Considered for promotion to arbiter, you also will be, for your bravery and work in the expedition."`
			`	The consul group leaves, and Kicharri approaches you and Sedlitaris, "Tell me about how you were right all along, later, you can," Kicharri tells Sedlitaris. "Right now, add you back to the list of active Heliarchs, I must. Marked as deceased by a 'glitch in the system,' you apparently were." He taps one leg on the ground repeatedly, glancing at your ship. "Glad that you are back safely, I am."`
			`	He leaves as well, and Sedlitaris turns to you. "A bit disorganized, but at least welcomed we were, right?" She looks at your ship, then looks startled. "Your payment! No time to transfer the funds to you, they gave me," she pulls out a personal device, and transfers the 10,000,000 credits to your account. "There you are. Worth much more, your assistance was, but unfortunately limited, my funds are."`

				`	"Don't worry, I'm glad to have helped."`

				`	"Why was everyone so surprised we made it back? Seems they expected to never see you again."`
			`	Her smile drops as you ask the question, and she seemingly struggles to find a place to look at. "I... I, Captain-" She looks around, then takes a deep breath. "I'm sorry, Captain. Ever since independence from the Quarg, we gained, six expeditions out of the Coalition, there were. Return, only ships of the first of them did. The most well equipped and numerous, my ancestor's fleet was, the sixth expeditionary fleet. Increasingly more fearful of leaving, we became, and with the last expedition having been centuries ago, a taboo, even talking about leaving has become. A year after the sixth had left, effectively forbid any further expeditions, the council did." She travels around with her eyes again. "I'm sorry that kept it hidden from you, I have. Wished to find out what happened, I did. Afraid I was, that refuse to help me like everyone else, you would, if you knew of the risk."`
			choice
				`	"Well, we made it back safely, and you were passionate enough about this to take the risk. I don't hold it against you."`
					goto forgive
				`	"So you lied to me. You could've gotten us both killed - we could be in a ship sinking into an ocean."`
			`	She's taken aback. "Captain, no Quarg pursuing us, there were. Surely now that inhabit all those systems, humans do, avoid attacking ships like that..." She stops, and sighs. "Sorry for lying to you I am, Captain."`
				goto end
			label forgive
			`	She breathes in relief. "Thank you, Captain. To trick you, my intention wasn't. Thanks to your help, maybe put an end to this fear of leaving, or even convince the council to get the expedition efforts going again, I can."`
			label end
			`	Suddenly, a Saryd Sojourner nearly rams your ship, just barely avoiding it as it comes to a stop while turning. "My little brother," Sedlitaris says as she looks at the ship. "Forgive me Captain, but get to seeing my family, I must. From the discussion earlier, very worried about me, they must have been. Thanks again for everything." Her brother rushes into hugging her as he leaves his ship, then proceeds to shake her while screaming something. An elderly Saryd couple slowly comes out of the Sojourner as well, and Sedlitaris and her brother go and meet them, hugging and going inside. The Sojourner takes off before the spaceport workers can even begin tending to the ship, and you look at it as it leaves the ringworld.`
			`	When you go back inside your ship, you're notified that more credits have been transferred to your account. It seems to be from the Heliarch government, giving you an extra 25,000,000 credits and thanking you for helping recover the data of the sixth expedition.`
