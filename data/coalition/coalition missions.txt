On many Coalition worlds, all three species live together in harmony, which is made easier by the fact that each species prefers a very different climate and thus gravitates to different parts of a planet. They are ruled by individuals known as the Heliarchs.`
		conversation
			`This planet seems to be inhabited by at least three different sentient species. First are giant beetles, about a meter tall, who scurry quickly toward your ship and swarm around it, gawking at you, as soon as you land. The second species, even more disturbing than the beetles, are giant spiders. And the third species are centaurs. Not just something vaguely resembling centaurs; they look like they could have stepped right off the page of a story book from ancient Earth.`
			`	One of the spiders walks up to you, stretching its legs to raise its face and many eyes to the level of your own face, and says something to you in a gloopy sort of burbling language that you don't understand. The beetles, meanwhile, are talking to each other in a different language, all clicks and chittering. And the centaur stands quietly at a distance and keeps glancing back toward the spaceport as if waiting for someone.`
			`	And eventually, someone does arrive: a beetle, a spider, and a centaur all wearing yellow armbands, small, triangle-shaped metal headpieces, and some sort of electric box hanging on a chain around each of their necks. They walk up to you, and the centaur speaks. After a brief delay, the box around its neck says, "In the name of the Heliarchs, who drove out the oppressors, who maintain peace, we the human visitor greet."`
			choice
				`	"Thank you."`
					goto next
				`	"How do you know my language?"`
			`	The spider speaks, and the box around its neck translates. "Our nearest and most recent neighbor you are. The Heliarchs in their great wisdom, all things that come to pass in our region of space, they are aware of."`
			label next
			`	Speaking through its own translation box, the beetle says, "To the seat of the Heliarch government must you go. Once to the Heliarchs you have become known, in many ways to our society, contribute you may."`
			`	The centaur pulls out a map printed on a thin sheet of plastic. You recognize it as a star map of this region. Lines mark out three different territories, and where they meet are three star systems colored yellow. The centaur points to the southernmost of the three. "Where you must go, here it is," they say.`
			choice
				`	"Thank you. I will go there."`
					goto end
				`	"Can you tell me more about yourselves, first?"`
			`	The spider says, "The wise Heliarchs, all your questions they will answer."`
			label end
			`	Eventually the crowd disperses and allows you to visit the spaceport, although no one offers you any jobs or the opportunity to buy anything but basic commodities. Perhaps you need to register with the "Heliarchs" first.`

Thousands of years ago, the Heliarchs led their three species to band together and drive the Quarg out of Coalition space. The Heliarch centers of government are the three Quarg ringworlds that they captured in that war. They are the only ones in Coalition space who are allowed to have weapons on their starships, and they act as a sort of police force, maintaining peace between the Coalition species.`

			`Your first view of the landing area confirms beyond a doubt that this is a Quarg ringworld, not just an imitation of one. The interior architecture is unmistakable. But no Quarg are present here, only the three species of the Coalition. Soon after you land, a delegation approaches your ship: again, one of each species, but these are wearing golden circlets around their heads. The circlets are not merely decorative, but seem to contain some electronics as well.`
			`	Again, the centaur speaks first. "To our territory, to welcome you we are glad," they say.`

For six thousand Earth years now, in prosperity and freedom from Quarg constraint and in friendship with each other we have lived."`

					goto oppressive
				`	"How did you defeat the Quarg?"`

"A second Coalition you are forming!" says the centaur, tapping their hooves on the floor in excitement. "Once again, foiled the Quarg are. A secret way for species to work together, they have overlooked. Great things, from this may come."`

			`	They tell you that the best way to learn more about them is to visit their worlds, and to see for yourself how the three species live in friendship and equality. They also offer to give you jobs to do in their territory, so that you may become a "valuable contributor" to their society.`

Stepping off of your ship you're greeted by what is unmistakably an outfitter, and as you look around you spot some other large buildings dotting the surrounding area, with members of the Coalition going to and from them. The atmosphere feels like that of a small village turned into an outdoor shopping mall.`
			`	Shortly after landing you're greeted by an Arach wearing what you judge to be some sort of uniform. He takes a translation device out of his pocket and formally greets you. "Honored to have you as a guest, the great House Mallob is, Captain <first> <last>."`

You follow him along the path, and he gives a bit more detail on some of the buildings as you walk near them. What really piques your interest though is that one of the buildings, which he seemed to willingly ignore, had armed guards at the door, with no indication of being members of the Heliarch.`
			`	Reaching the entrance of the mansion, it isn't as castle-like as the walls, but it all still looks strangely pompous. Up close it almost looks like all the several parts and pods of an Arach Hulk or two were crumpled together into one single building.`
			`	He guides you through the mansion. You pass by several other servants, notice rooms where he mentions that members of House Mallob are having meetings, and even meet a group of Saryd and Kimek students who came here to study with the shipwrights of House Mallob.`

		conversation
			`You're window-browsing a shop in the spaceport when you catch the scuff of too quick footsteps coming toward you. Before you can glance in that direction, you're suddenly tackled into the ground by someone astonishingly human-shaped. You try to get up, but whoever attacked you pins you down, pressing your face into the ground and holding your arms behind your back to restrain you. As you struggle against your attacker you manage to catch sight of long hair and then, with a flash of concern, a glimpse of green skin - an Alpha.`
			`	You are not pressed for long though. You feel the Alpha's attention shift to the side you cannot see, as an Arach swoops in with a tackle. The Alpha lets go of your arms in an attempt to block the attack, but it does not prevent the Arach from bowling them clear off of you where the two begin to wrestle in your line of sight. The Alpha is a man and, surprisingly to you, despite his strength, it doesn't take long for the Arach Heliarch to restrain your attacker. The Arach firmly pins his arms to his torso with four legs, holds his hips down with two, and uses her last pair to lever herself until she rests her entire body weight into pinning the Alpha.`
			`	A Saryd Heliarch approaches and tells you to keep your distance before interposing himself partially between you and your assailant. He then looks at the Alpha and asks through his translator box, "What reason for attacking this person, did you have?"`
			`	The Alpha is still struggling to try and get out of the Arach's grip, and you notice an intricate gold necklace which has splayed across his shoulder and onto the floor in the scuffle, jangling in the quiet every time he struggles. At this point, everyone else has cleared out of the area and is giving the scene a wide berth. As you get to your feet he ignores the Saryd's question and looks at you intensely. "You're with the Navy, aren't you? Finally figured out I was here, thought you'd finish the job?"`

					goto detained
			`	"And I'm supposed to believe that crap?" He lashes out, trying again to knock the Arach off of him, but the agent only tightens the grip. She opens her mandibles, getting them close to the Alpha's neck. "Alright, alright, I get it!" the Alpha shouts, stopping his attempts to break free.`
				goto detained
			label "not navy"
			`	He stares at you for a moment, as if unsure if you're telling the truth. "What the hell are you doing here then? Did you just stumble onto this place?" He stops struggling, but the Arach agent doesn't loosen her grip.`
			label detained
			`	The Saryd walks closer to the Alpha, stomping his hooves on the ground with each step. "Whatever your motivation was, a transgression, you have committed. Punished accordingly, you shall be," he says. "Kindly follow us to the detention facility, would you, Captain?" he asks you, but doesn't wait for an answer, as more agents arrive to escort you and the Alpha to the "detention facility."`
			`	On your way there, you start feeling stings on your arms and legs, and realize the Alpha's tackle left you with some bruises. "Treat those, we will, after faced trial, your aggressor has," the Saryd says as you approach your destination: a building similar to a police station. The Alpha is brought before a Kimek that you guess is in charge of the facility. He asks you to give a testimony of what happened, with the Heliarch agents confirming what you say. "Your first offense in a long time this is, Alitis," the Kimek says, after checking a computer for the Alpha's data. "Three years in seclusion, your sentence is."`
			`	After the short verdict, which seems to lack much of the due process you would expect in human space, the agents bring both you and the Alpha to a lower level of the building. This floor has several empty cells kept shut by thick, tough walls of some transparent material. While the cell block does appear to go further beyond this section and around a corner, the first few cells appear to be directly opposite a modest medical space, presumably used mostly for treating any injured prisoners without leaving the secure level. At present though, all of the cells appear to be empty, and the Heliarchs simply lock him in the second cell, where accessing his would not obstruct any other doorways. The agents then ask that you wait a few minutes for a medic to arrive so that they can take care of your bruises.`
			`	You notice that cut into the transparent material of the walls are a series of small holes at head-height with a cover that can be slid across them, presumably to silence a prisoner if needed. By default, they appear to be left open, and the Heliarch agents have not closed the one on the Alpha's cell.`
			`	Your eyes shift from the holes in the wall to the Alpha to find his eyes fixated on you, not looking away or even blinking. After you stare him down for a couple of seconds, he speaks up. "What is it, are you expecting some sort of apology? I'd consider my caution to be entirely justified, so you won't get one."`
			choice
				`	"Who are you? How did you even get here?"`
				`	"What are you doing here in the Coalition?"`
			`	He frowns at you. "I don't owe you any answers, cur. Shut up and wait for the law to bring the frail princess some band-aids and a lollipop."`
			choice
				`	"Are you so busy in that empty cell that you can't answer me?"`
				`	"Tough talk for someone who wrestled a spider and lost."`
			`	He leans forward, his legs twitching as if stopped mid-tackle, and he pauses, turning to look down the hallway to where the Heliarchs went. He backs up, slowing his breathing, and then sits down. "Alright. This may be the last time in three years I can have a proper conversation, so I will entertain you. My name... is Alitis. Over a century ago my kin stumbled upon an alien civilization beyond the Far North in conflict with bands of invaders. These invaders possessed drives capable of jumping between systems without the need for hyperspace links, technology that we greatly desired, for it could put us far outside of the reach of... you." He fixates his eyes on yours, ever so slightly closing his eyelids. "We explored the far reaches of the galaxy to the east, but found no place to call home. Our only choice was to return to the Dirt Belt where we knew of an enclave of more kin, only for the Navy," he spits on the ground, then looks at you again, "to find us. We evacuated, and my kin thought it wise to return to the east, but I knew better. I stole one of the drives my kin had along with a small ship and began traveling west. That is when I discovered the Coalition, and they have provided for me a home that I have been unable to find elsewhere in the galaxy."`
			choice
				`	"You 'knew better?' What do you mean?"`
				`	"What, did you have a change of heart once you got here?"`
			`	He gets up in a rush. "Full of questions, aren't you?" He approaches the wall again, in slow steps. "I was among the first of my kind. Athis, I was called then. I have traveled the galaxy for many centuries and witnessed many things. I have been ambushed, cornered many times; fear was not a stranger to me, for as soulless as your kind see me, we still feel. But when I traveled to the east, someone, or... something, rather, spoke to me. A voice with an immense weight. And for the first time, I felt something more than fear. I felt dread. So when my kin decided to return to the east, I was not so inclined to return with them."`
			choice
				`	"Voices in your head? Are you sure you weren't just imagining them?"`
					goto imaginary
				`	"What did the voice say?"`
			`	He looks away from you. "You're here now, aren't you? This means you must have a device to jump beyond links as I did. Travel to the east and find out for yourself what the voices say. Find out if it classifies you as 'disposable' as well."`
				goto end
			label imaginary
			`	He looks away from you. "No imaginary thing could have such an impact on me. You're here now, aren't you? This means you must have a device to jump beyond links as I did. Travel to the east and find out for yourself that the voices are real."`
			label end
			`	The Heliarchs inform you that the medic has arrived, and bring you further down the hallway to a room where they treat your bruises. They examine you briefly, then give you a tube with a thick liquid, almost like a gel, asking that you gently apply it on your wounds. Once you're done, they tell you that the pain should wear off within a few minutes, and an agent escorts you back out. Passing by his cell again, you see Alitis still standing with his back to the hallway, looking straight at the wall. The agent brings you to your ship, and thanks you for your cooperation.`

Vellorae then begins walking around the altar, repeatedly circling it as the sun climbs higher, until it finally reaches its peak and the sun's reflection on the gem is strongest. At this point, she approaches the altar again and covers the bangle with her hands. She remains there silently for a moment, and then she retrieves the bangle and leaves the shrine. As she walks past, the other Saryds give her sympathetic looks, and one of the younger ones even approaches to offer her condolences before Vellorae approaches you again.`

			`<origin>'s spaceport searchlights guide you to the hangars in the middle of a thunderstorm, and Vellorae says she'll wait it out inside your ship as she pays you 45,500 credits. "At her shrine only after dusk, Magl Ina is anyway, so in a hurry, I am not." The storm lasts halfway into the evening, and once the light reaching through the layers of fog starts to dim, you open your ship's hatch for Vellorae to head out.`
			`	You accompany her across the murky spaceport, until you find a local Saryd for her to talk to. Vellorae asks him if he would guide the two of you to the shrine. "To a site of worship, why is this human going?" he asks, while eyeing you somewhat suspiciously.`
			`	"On a pilgrimage to mourn my late husband, I am." Vellorae says. "Helping me with traveling to each shrine, Captain <last> is."`
			`	"But, to the shrine, must the Captain go?" He asks. "Help you with mourning there, a human cannot."`

			`	You stick close to Vellorae as the two of you try to keep the local Saryd in sight. The task is difficult as he nearly vanishes into the fog whenever he gets too far ahead, only for his silhouette to become clearer again after he waits for you to catch up. After many minutes, you feel the ground beneath your shoes shift from the solid spaceport platform to gravel to wet patches of the planet's mossy "grass." Finally you reach a minuscule lake, or perhaps a very large puddle, in the middle of a mossy field surrounded by toppled and hollowed out tree trunks.`
			`	As the two of you approach the water, the local Saryd warns you not to touch it. Vellorae looks at it as if gazing into a mirror, or perhaps she is just trying to make out the reflection of the moon, scattered and vague through the layers of mist. She then moves to one of the tree trunks, and placing the bangle inside it as she lays on the ground facing the water, lays both her hands reverently on the trunk. She spends nearly an hour in this position, during which the chill of the fog slowly seeps through your coat and into your bones. Vellorae and the Saryd who guided you don't seem particularly bothered by it, but she is quick to finish once she looks over and notices you shivering. She picks the bangle up from the trunk and stands, and then asks the other Saryd to guide you two back to the spaceport.`
			`	"For taking so long, terribly sorry I am, Captain <last>," she says on the way back. "Lost in prayer I was, not even consider how uncomfortable the cold must've been for you, I did."`

			`	You follow the Saryd back to the gravel path and then to the spaceport grounds, where Vellorae thanks him for guiding the two of you to the shrine.

Shortly after noon you two enter a restaurant, where she insists on paying for your meal. You tour the city with her for a while longer and, just before the sun sets, reach the forest at the base of the mountain on top of which Starlit University is located.`
			`	Once night falls, many lights start to appear inside the forest, and Vellorae beckons you to follow her in. "Stick close, you should. Difficult to navigate the path, for other species it often is." As you walk down a trail with her, you approach one of the lights to see that it's a bonfire on a platform in a miniature clearing, at what you hope is a safe distance from the trees around it. Continuing to the next light, Vellorae clutches the bangle in her hands the entire time, humming some guttural, almost tribal chant. As you pass by another fire, a short burst of flames gets closer to some nearby shrubs, but thankfully is put out before it can cause any harm. It is extinguished with an odd, large, fabric net on a pole by a cloaked Saryd who seemed to materialize from the trees near the fire.`
			`	"Take care to not damage the forest with the path's fires, we must, so volunteer for keeping the flames, many of the local students do." Vellorae tells you.

Only as you step out of the woods do you notice that you're back where the path started, even though you were certain you had kept to only one side of the mountain.`

You try and follow along, but subtitles for the transmissions only come in Kimek or Arach. A few hours into the night, you leave your ship to wait for Vellorae, who arrives shortly after.`

A few seconds into the conversation, they tense up, crossing their arms and swiping them down as if refusing something, then running off. She tries again with some of the other Saryds, but continues to be rejected. She looks back at your ship dejectedly, then starts eyeing the other ships docked nearby before heading toward a Kimek Thorn that has just landed. As she talks to the captain, the Kimek seems confused, but after a moment he briefly re-enters their ship, returning in a puffy coat to follow Vellorae to the railway hub.`

You leave your ship, follow her to the railway hub, and board one of trains that appears to be one of the oldest and most simple. It lacks seats for non-Saryds, so you are forced to hold tight to what handrails you can reach.`
			`	You remain on the train until the very last stop, when the sun is already starting to set. As you depart, you see a rural village with just a few dozen buildings and a simple dirt road, where a couple workers battle the snow and ice to keep it clear and easy to traverse. You follow Vellorae down the road, and once you reach a rocky pillar with a hole carved through it, she turns to the forest, heading out on a thin, straight trail. Looking behind you, you see the setting sun fitting inside the pillar's opening.`
			`	As you follow Vellorae down the trail, you see the trees gradually show more and more signs of a forest fire, with darker, damaged barks, increasingly ashy soil, and many fallen, decomposing portions of the forest. The trail ends abruptly at a large scar scorched through the forest. The piles of ash still present below your feet almost resemble the rest of the planet's otherwise snowy ground, but somehow are kept from mixing with the snow. Whether deliberately cleared by more workers or some other force, you cannot tell. Near the center of the scar you see a small mound with an opening in the side, almost like a "shack" made out of the charred tree trunks and rocks. A faint light comes from within it.`
			`	While you're looking at the mound, Vellorae grabs your hand and starts hesitantly pulling you toward it. Inside, the fading sunlight behind you contrasts with the source of the light within, a small pyre in the middle of the "shack" which has only a few lone flames dancing on the embers. Vellorae lays down in front of it, removes her bangle, and places it in the flames for a brief moment before snatching it up and standing again. Once on her feet, she grabs your hand again, tugging you along as she hurries back to the edge of the scorched clearing.`

Dozens of searchlights are dotted along the edges, lighting the ground below, while a warehouse complex sits at the center of the plateau top. As you're approaching the plateau, your ship's sensors alert you to incoming vessels; you look at your radar to see a Saryd Sojourner, followed by three Travelers, getting closer to your ship.

After some short minutes inside the tunnel dug into the mesa walls, you reach the end: a room carefully carved out, with ten objects similar to the pylon Sedlitaris carried there, though four are of very different design, being closer to a beige, blocky obelisk. She puts down the pylon, and asks that you shine a light on it so that she can configure it. Then, she begins to tinker with some wires connected to a panel on the lower half of the pylon. "To determine which one of these is the most recent, send a signal in its frequency, I will."`

Failures due to the great distance to Saryd space, and difficulty in getting supplies, they were. Because of that, once leaving initial expedition logs in this world, we began, bothered to create proper infrastructure, my predecessors didn't." She thinks for a while, then continues, "Although, help make it less likely for others to find it, the poor entrance might."`

Worlds apart, the programs used before and after the War of Independence are, but kept in place, the overall practice was."`
			label pylon
			`	Once she's done with the wires, she pushes a button and a humming beep comes from one of the machines with the same, spiraling design. "That one, it is," she says, and asks that you help her move her pylon close to the one that emitted the sound. She connects the two with cables by the base of each pylon; the older pylon clicks on after a moment, letting out several beeps in a short chant. "Enough energy to transfer its data now, it should have."`
			`	A few seconds pass, and another hum comes. She looks at a small screen on the panel, and confirms that the data's all safe. "Copy the data from expeditions prior to their pylon here, the sixth did, so saved us some time, they have. Play their recorded log via my translation device, I shall." She disconnects the two pylons from one another, and inputs a few commands on the panel. After a short pause, an audio message begins playing, and is picked up and translated by the box hanging from Sedlitaris' neck.`
			`	"Log started, sixth expedition to the outside. Arbiter Mimodum, this is, leading the sixth. Using these pylons, keep track of our major stops, we shall. To push out further than what is recorded in our previous maps, if possible, the mission directive is. Wish to gather data on how safe the outside systems are, I do. Split the fleet in half, I have.

You fly your ship southward, and she asks that you stop halfway to the pole. She inputs commands again, and another beep comes. "Passed it, we have. Determine its exact position, we must. Little battery for these countersignals, the pylons have." You fly northeast, and then straight west, with her emitting a signal each time your ship stops.`

Sedlitaris says the pylon must have gotten covered in the ice due to glacial melting and refreezing, though that doesn't seem to have damaged its systems; she accesses the data remotely after tinkering with the pylon in your ship for a while.`

You do your best to avoid them as you fly around the mountain, and Sedlitaris continues to send signals to find the pylon.`
			`	"Inside the mountain, it could be. From there, the countersignals are coming." She stops for a few minutes and looks at the view of the mountain on your monitors. She tries again, and asks that you get closer. When you're finishing yet another lap, she asks that you stop your ship, keeping it steady in the air. "Zoom your cameras here, could you, Captain?" she asks, pointing to the middle of a monitor. You zoom in and see a circle of large rocks, surrounded by dragon nests. Atop the rocks are some patches of foliage, and in the middle lies a small, dark, tower-like structure, stuck in the rocks by one end. After looking at it for a few seconds, you both realize it's an upside-down pylon. "Taken it as some form of token, the dragons must have," Sedlitaris says. "Hopes of retrieving some of the pylons physically, I had, but prefer to dig out the glacier for the previous one than test my luck against the dragons, I do. Unlock this one's data remotely, I will."`
			`	A dragon perches on your ship as she begins the transfer. It tries to bite down on the engines, but you start moving your ship again to shake it off. You avoid other dragons as they fly by your ship until the download is complete, and head straight for the spaceport city.`

Scoured the planet with our searches, we have, but no trace of the previously visited ruins, or any other sign of the group that lived here, we found. Assured me that all our ships' navigation systems are working properly, the engineers have, but at the coordinates where they should be, the ruins are not, as if they had never been there. A confusing disappointment, this was, but continue with the mission, we must. Heading far north, to Summit, we are. The last point before regrouping with the split group, it will be."`

				`	"Did they ever find any member of that species?"`
				`	"They couldn't find out anything more? Just some jetpacks with pockets?"`

Asked the Quarg about the findings, the Saryds had, but to their surprise they acted as if there was nothing here. For the time, very odd of them to do that, it was."

You spend the next few hours retelling what you saw, and helping her collect what information on the Sheragi and their ruins humans have learned since Foster published his initial findings.`

			`You fly around the moon as Sedlitaris nails down the coordinates of the pylon, until you land close to one of the forests. "Deeper inside, the pylon must be. Uninhabited by humans this world is, correct?" You confirm this, and she prepares to leave. "No dragons to worry about here, there are, so try to bring this pylon back with us, I will."`
			`	You two leave your ship and enter the forest, taking turns carrying the pylon you brought, which is easy enough to do since the gravity is so much lower here. Occasionally Sedlitaris stops and has the pylon put down so that she can determine where to go next. Eventually, you notice the trees start getting smaller as you move on, until you reach a wide, odd clearing where the ground is devoid of any of the local flora. Sedlitaris spots the other pylon on the opposite side, half stuck in the ground, and moves to pull it out. As you follow her to the machine, you notice deep, perfectly straight holes in the ground, forming lines that sometimes cross the entire clearing and continue well past it. Soil and dust have filled most of them up, but in certain gaps you can look down to cracks that must be dozens of meters deep.`
			`	Sedlitaris ties a rope around the end of the pylon that's visible and pulls it, forcing up the dirt as she brings the rest of the device to surface. She connects it with the pylon you brought and accesses the data from there. "Much more active here, the expedition was," she says. "Three recordings, there are. Bring these back to your ship, we should; listen to the first one there, we can."`
			`	Both of you carrying a pylon, you make your way out of the forest and back to your ship, where Sedlitaris immediately plays the oldest entry: "Log started. Send two Punishers further north, I did, but returned yet, they have not. As for the crimson anomaly on the nearby western system, still unresponsive, it is. Be it a Finisher barrage or attempting to ram it, no reaction from the anomaly, there was. A simple nebula, the researchers claim it is not; think that we are missing something, they do. Wait a few more days for the Punishers to return, I will. In the meantime, back to that system, I will go. Maybe learn something about the anomaly, we can."`
			`	After Mimodum's voice has disappeared, Sedlitaris urges you to take off. "Heard of this 'anomaly' before, I had not. Look for the system it's in, at once we must. Hopefully still there after the centuries, it is."`

			`Sedlitaris uses your commlink to tell the spaceport authorities that she's returned, and soon after you land a crowd of Heliarchs and Coalition civilians alike are surrounding your ship. The Heliarch agents try and organize the crowd as best as they can, and a group of Heliarch consuls rush through the masses to meet you two at your ship.`
			`	"Inspector! A most... fortunate return this is. A great deal of information you've collected, we take it?" an Arach consul asks.`
			`	"Yes, eager to hear your report, we are," one of the Kimek consuls continues. "A rare occasion, it is, to be able to learn of the outside from one of our esteemed inspectors."`
			`	A Saryd consul, who's kept a stern look on his face, cuts in. "Returned with his fleet, your ancestor, Mimodum, did not. Learned of the reason for that, have you?"`
			`	"Yes," she says. "Recover as much information as I wished to, I could not, but prepared a report on what Captain <last> and I found, I have. Additionally, recovered two of the pylons Mimodum left, we have."`

As they tell her to follow them to the room where the presentation will happen, a Kimek Heliarch breaks through the line of agents keeping the crowd back. You recognize him as Arbiter Kicharri, who you met just before Sedlitaris received approval from the Heliarch council.`
			`	"What is this?" The Saryd consul steps in front of Kicharri as he approaches. "Arbiter, shared with you in due time, the findings will be, but the inspector's report to us consuls, the priority is, so return to your duties you-"`
			`	"No, meet with her family, she will," Kicharri interrupts him. "Heard nothing but hell from her brother, I have. Devastated, her parents were. Now that returned, she has, see them and calm their worries, she will."`
			`	"By whose orders?" An Arach consul jumps in. "Intrigued by her findings, we all are, and listen to her at once, we must."`
			`	"Orders?" Kicharri exclaims. "Orders for her to leave and die, you thought you had given her!" Kicharri looks at Sedlitaris, then back at the consuls. "If so intrigued you are, surely to miss out on any information, you don't want. Best suited for giving a full report, she will be, once rested from her expedition, she has."`
			`	Irked by his response, the consuls have the agents clear the area and have your ship made into a makeshift meeting room for a while, making everyone get out while they head inside to discuss. After many minutes, they come back out, and one of the Kimek says, "Ten days of leave you will be given, tribune. After that, present us your findings, you must. Considered for promotion to arbiter, you also will be, for your bravery and work in the expedition."`
			`	The consul group leaves, and Kicharri approaches you and Sedlitaris. "Tell me about how you were right all along, later, you can," Kicharri tells Sedlitaris. "Right now, add you back to the list of active Heliarchs, I must. Marked as deceased by a 'glitch in the system,' you apparently were." He taps one leg on the ground repeatedly, glancing at your ship. "Glad that you are back safely, I am."`
			`	He leaves as well, and Sedlitaris turns to you. "A bit disorganized, but at least welcomed we were, right?" She looks at your ship, then looks startled. "Your payment! No time to transfer the funds to you, they gave me," she pulls out a personal device, and transfers the 10,000,000 credits to your account. "There you are.

				`	"Why was everyone so surprised we made it back? Seems they expected to never see you again."`
			`	Her smile drops as you ask the question, and she seemingly struggles to find a place to look at. "I... I, Captain-" She looks around, then takes a deep breath. "Sorry I am, Captain. Ever since independence from the Quarg, we gained, six expeditions out of the Coalition, there were. Return, only ships of the first of them did. The most well equipped and numerous, my ancestor's fleet was, the sixth expeditionary fleet. Increasingly more fearful of leaving, we became, and with the last expedition having been centuries ago, a taboo, even talking about leaving has become. A year after the sixth had left, effectively forbid any further expeditions, the council did." She travels around with her eyes again. "Sorry I am, that kept it hidden from you, I have. Wish to find out what happened, I did. Afraid I was, that refuse to help me like everyone else, you would, if know of the risk, you did."`

				`	"Well, we made it back safely, and you were passionate enough about this to take the risk. I don't hold it against you."`

				`	"So you lied to me. You could've gotten us both killed - we could be in a ship sinking into an ocean."`

				goto end

			`	Suddenly, a Saryd Sojourner nearly rams your ship, just barely avoiding it as it lands less than twenty meters from your ship. "My little brother," Sedlitaris says as she looks at the ship. "Forgive me Captain, but get to seeing my family, I must. From the discussion earlier, very worried about me, they must have been. Thanks again for everything." Her brother rushes into hugging her as he leaves his ship, then proceeds to shake her while screaming something. An elderly Saryd couple slowly comes out of the Sojourner as well, and Sedlitaris and her brother go and meet them, hugging and going inside. The Sojourner takes off before the spaceport workers can even begin tending to the ship, and you look at it as it leaves the ringworld.`

She taps somewhere on the desk with one of her legs, and a screen appears at the top, showing a map of the local star systems. "Recognize this one, do you?" she asks, pointing to one of the systems.

As the <ship> touches down on the hangar, the platform loudly moves gears and chains, and soon starts bringing the ship, and you, deep down into the facility, with hangar doors closing above you shortly. When the elevator stops, you and Flopug step out into what's something of a mix between a Coalition outfitter, and House Idriss' headquarters. Several Arachi work on their stations, most of them tending to a large amalgam of antennae dishes and sensors. "Our gift to you, that is," Flopug says as she signals to the Arachi to start installing the scanner into your ship. "The Outskirts Gauger, we've named it."`
			`	While the Arachi work on the outfit, she explains that they used the probe's algorithms to have the scanners excel at finding basic energy signatures, such as heat or energy levels of other ships. "Made to check for complex machinery like outfits, or recognize specific cargo types, it was not, but still find uses for its current form, I'm sure you will."`
			`	When everything's ready, you two head back inside your ship, and the elevator brings you back up. You fly back to the main landing area, and she pulls close to you just before you open your hatch. "Now, still... experimental, the outfit is, and provide the Heliarchs with a potentially faulty product, we do not wish. So, naturally, not yet registered it with them, we have. Provide you with more copies, we cannot, so careful not to lose this one, you should be." She thanks you again for helping out, and leaves for her workplace.`

It was a darker portion of the spaceport, and as I kept calling out for my parents, I only ever heard my own voice echoing back. And then, I saw it. A large Quarg, with eyes of a deep, piercing purple, staring right at me, far down the hallway. I broke into a sprint to flee, but I kept running into more and more Quarg... I don't remember much after that, just that I eventually got back to my parents.`

I tried to keep the memories of that episode in my childhood away, for the sake of the project, but as I interviewed them, as I tried to talk and befriend them... even the polite ones, they seemed so... aloof. Different - and not in a good way. I just felt a great unease being there, near them again.

			`Landing on <planet>, Anna is excitedly holding a copy of 'Beyond the Hyperdrive.' She hastily opens the hatch as soon as it unlocks.`
			`	Anna stops, waiting for you to catch up. "In the message they sent me, they included instructions on how to reach their offices," she explains. "Let's go!"`
			`	Several long streets later, Anna is completely lost. "This isn't where the instructions were supposed to lead at all," she says, turning to Temporo, who has been following you the whole time. "Do you know how to get there?"`
			`	The Heliarch takes the lead, and within minutes you reach a train station. Once the train arrives, you travel to a neighborhood where a large white building dominates the skyline.`
			`	Circling around to the publisher's office, you find the entrance bustling with Kimek, along with the occasional Saryd and Arach coming and going. Anna looks for a front desk and directs you to a Kimek who appears to be a receptionist.`

				`	"We're looking for a publishing company called Priyepichia Publishing. Could you provide directions?"`
			`	"On the 16th floor, Priyepichia Publishing is. Over there, the elevators are," says the receptionist's translator.`
			`	You turn to where the Kimek points you and see six large elevators, larger than what you are familiar with in human space. Temporo leads you to the least crowded one.`
			`	The three of you enter the elevator. It makes stops at each floor of the building, and the elevator gets quieter as more Kimek reach their destinations. When you reach the 16th floor, the elevator is only half full. The door opens to reveal a Kimek, wearing an ornate jeweled necklace as well as a translation device.`
			choice
				`	"Hello?"`
				`	(Exit the elevator.)`
			`	"Greetings, humans. Follow me, you must, so discuss your book, we can," the Kimek says through its translation box.`

Along the way, you pass a lounge, a conference area where multiple Kimek are discussing something at a table with a group of Heliarchs, and a large open workspace where individual Kimek sit at their own computers.`
			`	After a few minutes of walking, you reach an office where another Kimek sits with a team of Heliarchs. Temporo takes a seat with them, making six - two from each species.`
			`	The Kimek guiding you gestures toward the office and heads over to speak with the group.`
			`	As you enter, Anna puts down the copy of her book on the table, and you each take a seat. The Kimek that led you here briefly speaks to the other non-Heliarch Kimek sitting at the interview table before leaving.`
			`	The sitting Kimek's translation device begins speaking.`
			`	"Greetings. Ikiyachee, my name is, and head editor of Priyepichia Publishing, I am. To see an alien want to publish a book, interesting and unexpected it was," the Kimek says.`
			`	"Hello, I am Anna Fangvin, and this is my friend <first> <last>, who has been very helpful in bringing me here," Anna says, somewhat flustered.`
			`	"From the introduction and the first few pages, interesting your book sounded, but run it past the Heliarch reviewers, we must. So, <first>, long and intensive, this interview will be. As very unique, to meet a human like her is, and to adapt her book to our culture, a long and drawn-out process it will be."`

			`	Once the first questions are asked, Anna is all too happy to begin discussing the contents of her novel in great detail.`
			`	Under the watchful eye of the six Heliarchs in the room, Anna explains her anti-Quarg sentiments, the reasoning behind her choice to write the book, and the content of the book. She speaks quickly, but the Heliarchs' numerous questions for clarification and elaboration make the process a long one.`
			`	"Sold many books before coming here, have you?" Temporo asks. Anna embarrassedly glances in your direction. "Well, no," she replies. "But I've been writing better and better over the past few years."`
			`	Priyepichia's representative speaks up. "Word count, we must know. Binding process, aware of you are? What type and cover style, want you?"`
			`	"The hardcover book should have a jump drive emblazoned on the front cover. I'm not sure the exact options for a binding type in this area of space; couldn't you just decide that yourself?"`
			`	As you listen, you learn that due to the Coalition's review process to make the book more suitable, Anna will have to stay for about half a year, during which she will have an apartment to live in.`

			`	After thirty minutes, a Kimek approaches you. Their translation device speaks. "An alien in our space, you are? Most strange, this meeting truly is. A Coalition member the likes of you, I have never encountered. Or... ahmm... from outside of our space, are you?"`

			`	"So, 'Beyond the Hyperdrive,' it is, you say? Thankful, I am. On its release, buy the book, I will remember to."`
