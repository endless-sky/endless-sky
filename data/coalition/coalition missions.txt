On many Coalition worlds, all three species live together in harmony, which is made easier by the fact that each species prefers a very different climate and thus gravitates to different parts of a planet. They are ruled by individuals known as the Heliarchs.`
		conversation
			`This planet seems to be inhabited by at least three different sentient species. First are giant beetles, about a meter tall, who scurry quickly toward your ship and swarm around it, gawking at you, as soon as you land. The second species, even more disturbing than the beetles, are giant spiders. And the third species are centaurs. Not just something vaguely resembling centaurs; they look like they could have stepped right off the page of a story book from ancient Earth.`
			`	One of the spiders walks up to you, stretching its legs to raise its face and many eyes to the level of your own face, and says something to you in a gloopy sort of burbling language that you don't understand. The beetles, meanwhile, are talking to each other in a different language, all clicks and chittering. And the centaur stands quietly at a distance and keeps glancing back toward the spaceport as if waiting for someone.`
			`	And eventually, someone does arrive: a beetle, a spider, and a centaur all wearing yellow armbands and some sort of electric box hanging on a chain around each of their necks. They walk up to you, and the centaur speaks. After a brief delay, the box around its neck says, "In the name of the Heliarchs, who drove out the oppressors, who maintain peace, we the human visitor greet."`
			choice
				`	"Thank you."`
					goto next
				`	"How do you know my language?"`
			`	The spider speaks, and the box around its neck translates. "Our nearest and most recent neighbor you are. The Heliarchs in their great wisdom, all things that come to pass in our region of space, they are aware of."`
			label next
			`	Speaking through its own translation box, the beetle says, "To the seat of the Heliarch government must you go. Once to the Heliarchs you have become known, in many ways to our society, contribute you may."`
			`	The centaur pulls out a map printed on a thin sheet of plastic. You recognize it as a star map of this region. Lines mark out three different territories, and where they meet are three star systems colored yellow. The centaur points to the southernmost of the three. "Where you must go, here it is," it says.`
			choice
				`	"Thank you. I will go there."`
					goto end
				`	"Can you tell me more about yourselves, first?"`
			`	The spider says, "The wise Heliarchs, all your questions they will answer."`
			label end
			`	Eventually the crowd disperses and allows you to visit the spaceport, although no one offers you any jobs or the opportunity to buy anything but basic commodities. Perhaps you need to register with the "Heliarchs" first.`

Thousands of years ago, the Heliarchs led their three species to band together and drive the Quarg out of Coalition space. The Heliarch centers of government are the three Quarg ringworlds that they captured in that war. They are the only ones in Coalition space who are allowed to have weapons on their starships, and they act as a sort of police force, maintaining peace between the Coalition species.`

			`Your first view of the landing area confirms beyond a doubt that this is a Quarg ringworld, not just an imitation of one. The interior architecture is unmistakable. But no Quarg are present here, only the three species of the Coalition. Soon after you land, a delegation approaches your ship: again, one of each species, but these are wearing golden circlets around their heads. The circlets are not merely decorative, but seem to contain some electronics as well.`
			`	Again, the centaur speaks first. "To our territory, to welcome you we are glad," it says.`

For six thousand Earth years now, in prosperity and freedom from Quarg constraint and in friendship with each other we have lived."`

				`	"How did you defeat the Quarg?"`

"A second Coalition you are forming!" says the centaur, tapping its hooves on the floor in excitement. "Once again, foiled the Quarg are. A secret way for species to work together, they have overlooked. Great things, from this may come."`
			label end
			`	You talk with them for a while longer, and learn that the centaurs are called "Saryds," and are the oldest of the three species. The beetles are the "Kimek," and come next, and the spiders are called "Arachi," and were the last of the three to discover spaceflight.`
			`	They tell you that the best way to learn more about them is to visit their worlds, and to see for yourself how the three species live in friendship and equality. They also offer to give you jobs to do in their territory, so that you may become a "valuable contributor" to their society.`

They guide you through the planet, bringing you to what looks like a massive, castle-like structure, which appears to be made out of a similar material to that of Arach ships, sitting at the base of a mountain.`
			`	You land on a large docking area, where some other ships are also conducting business. Stepping off of your ship you're greeted by what is unmistakingly an outfitter, and as you look around you spot some other large buildings dotting the surrounding area, with members of the Coalition going to and from them. The atmosphere feels like that of a small village turned into an outdoor shopping mall.`
			`	Shortly after landing you're greeted by an Arach wearing what you judge to be some sort of uniform. He takes a translation device out of his pocket and formally greets you. "Honored to have you as a guest, the great House Mallob is, Captain <first> <last>."`

			`	"Mountains, no! But a servant of House Mallob, I am. Mostly as a chauffeur, I work."`
				goto mistress
			label property
			`	"No mere mansion, the private property of House Mallob is," he says as he starts pointing to different areas. "A museum, there we have, detailing the history of Arach ships. To the left, a marketplace is. To the right, House Mallob's private university is, where study the advanced methods of ship making, honor students from all over the Coalition do."`
			label mistress
			`	He then asks that you follow him, saying, "Assist Lugglop in his research, my mistress will. Meet her in the mansion, you must." You follow him along the path, and he gives a bit more detail on some of the buildings as you walk near them. What really piques your interest though is that one of the buildings, which he seemed to willingly ignore, had armed guards at the door, with no indication of being members of the Heliarch.`
			`	Reaching the entrance of the mansion, it isn't as castle-like as the walls, but it all still looks strangely pompous. Up close it almost looks like all the several parts and pods of an Arach Hulk or two were crumpled together into one single building.`
			`	He guides you through the mansion. You pass by several other servants, notice rooms where he mentions that members of House Mallob are having meetings, and even meet a group of Saryd and Kimek students who came here to study with the shipwrights of House Mallob.`
			`	Finally, he brings you to a room on the third floor, claiming that your passenger is waiting inside. You enter, only to see a Kimek glancing out the window.`
			choice
				`	"I take it that's the shipwright?"`
					goto shipwright
				`	"So, is my passenger crawling around somewhere? In some corner hidden in a web?"`
				`	"A Kimek? I thought this was an Arach House."`
			`	The butler ignores what you said and introduces you to the Kimek in question. "Marry into House Mallob at a young age, miss Pichiie did. A former student at the university here, she was."`
				goto end

			`	"Correct you are, Captain," he says. "Proud to introduce you to miss Pichiie, I am. A former student at the university here, she was, before marry into House Mallob, she did."`
			label end
			`	Finally, the reason why you had to come all the way to this part of <origin> becomes clear; Pichiie mentions she would like to hear your stories about where you got the yottrite in the first place before boarding your ship to head to <planet>. You tell her all samples you've come across were found in systems where the star had gone supernova. It's a short explanation, but she appears to be satisfied, and after saying her goodbyes to other members of the House, you're both brought to your ship.`

			`You meet Lugglop in the spaceport and follow him to meet with Nasilor, Alituri, and Pichiie, who are overseeing some workers place a few sealed metal crates inside a container and the yottrite sample you just brought here into another. They detail how they have prepared all the material they needed and now just need a transport to <destination>.`

			`Immediately when you land, Lugglop gives you your payment of <payment>. You and the four researchers then follow some Heliarch agents that were waiting for you at the docks. You five are brought to an area akin to a theater with some type of podium on the stage. The seats are all taken by Heliarch agents.`
			`	Lugglop's team apparently will wait until the contents of the two containers are brought here, so you're asked to describe the systems with supernovae where you encountered yottrite asteroids. This only lasts a few minutes, as the audience doesn't seem too keen on inquiring about details, though one particular Saryd did puzzle you when they asked about the state of the supernovas you visited. You tell them you don't know what they mean, and they press the topic no further.`
			`	After you finish, and right as the materials for Lugglop's presentation arrives, you're escorted back to your ship by some agents. Several hours later, you're contacted by Lugglop, who says the presentation is finished, and his group is coming back to your ship. When they arrive, they each thank you for providing the means to perform their experiments. "Officially commended for our efforts, we were!" he says.` 
			`	"Though allowed to publicly share our findings, we are not still, invited to be part of the team here that will continue the research, we were," Pichiie adds. The Saryd twins say they will reside here for as long as the project continues, while Pichiie comments on how she'll often be taking trips to visit her family in House Mallob's property.`
			`	"As for me, a job as overseer, I still have to perform," Lugglop says. "Stay here for a few days I will, but even with all the advanced equipment of this ring, still our Coalition's most capable, the smelters of Bloptab's Furnace are. In their optimal state they must be, if to deepen our knowledge on yottrite, we are. Return there shortly, I will."`
			`	They thank you again for all your help and wish you safe travels as you continue exploring.`
