On many Coalition worlds, all three species live together in harmony, which is made easier by the fact that each species prefers a very different climate and thus gravitates to different parts of a planet. They are ruled by individuals known as the Heliarchs.`
		conversation
			`This planet seems to be inhabited by at least three different sentient species. First are giant beetles, about a meter tall, who scurry quickly toward your ship and swarm around it, gawking at you, as soon as you land. The second species, even more disturbing than the beetles, are giant spiders. And the third species are centaurs. Not just something vaguely resembling centaurs; they look like they could have stepped right off the page of a story book from ancient Earth.`
			`	One of the spiders walks up to you, stretching its legs to raise its face and many eyes to the level of your own face, and says something to you in a gloopy sort of burbling language that you don't understand. The beetles, meanwhile, are talking to each other in a different language, all clicks and chittering. And the centaur stands quietly at a distance and keeps glancing back toward the spaceport as if waiting for someone.`
			`	And eventually, someone does arrive: a beetle, a spider, and a centaur all wearing yellow armbands and some sort of electric box hanging on a chain around each of their necks. They walk up to you, and the centaur speaks. After a brief delay, the box around its neck says, "In the name of the Heliarchs, who drove out the oppressors, who maintain peace, we the human visitor greet."`
			choice
				`	"Thank you."`
					goto next
				`	"How do you know my language?"`
			`	The spider speaks, and the box around its neck translates. "Our nearest and most recent neighbor you are. The Heliarchs in their great wisdom, all things that come to pass in our region of space, they are aware of."`
			label next
			`	Speaking through its own translation box, the beetle says, "To the seat of the Heliarch government must you go. Once to the Heliarchs you have become known, in many ways to our society, contribute you may."`
			`	The centaur pulls out a map printed on a thin sheet of plastic. You recognize it as a star map of this region. Lines mark out three different territories, and where they meet are three star systems colored yellow. The centaur points to the southernmost of the three. "Where you must go, here it is," it says.`
			choice
				`	"Thank you. I will go there."`
					goto end
				`	"Can you tell me more about yourselves, first?"`
			`	The spider says, "The wise Heliarchs, all your questions they will answer."`

			`	Eventually the crowd disperses and allows you to visit the spaceport, although no one offers you any jobs or the opportunity to buy anything but basic commodities. Perhaps you need to register with the "Heliarchs" first.`

Thousands of years ago, the Heliarchs led their three species to band together and drive the Quarg out of Coalition space. The Heliarch centers of government are the three Quarg ringworlds that they captured in that war. They are the only ones in Coalition space who are allowed to have weapons on their starships, and they act as a sort of police force, maintaining peace between the Coalition species.`
		conversation
			`Your first view of the landing area confirms beyond a doubt that this is a Quarg ringworld, not just an imitation of one. The interior architecture is unmistakable. But no Quarg are present here, only the three species of the Coalition. Soon after you land, a delegation approaches your ship: again, one of each species, but these are wearing golden circlets around their heads. The circlets are not merely decorative, but seem to contain some electronics as well.`
			`	Again, the centaur speaks first. "To our territory, to welcome you we are glad," it says.`

For six thousand Earth years now, in prosperity and freedom from Quarg constraint and in friendship with each other we have lived."`

"A second Coalition you are forming!" says the centaur, tapping its hooves on the floor in excitement. "Once again, foiled the Quarg are. A secret way for species to work together, they have overlooked. Great things, from this may come."`
			label end
			`	You talk with them for a while longer, and learn that the centaurs are called "Saryds," and are the oldest of the three species. The beetles are the "Kimek," and come next, and the spiders are called "Arachi," and were the last of the three to discover spaceflight.`
			`	They tell you that the best way to learn more about them is to visit their worlds, and to see for yourself how the three species live in friendship and equality. They also offer to give you jobs to do in their territory, so that you may become a "valuable contributor" to their society.`

			`As the athletes leave your ship and hand you your pay of 300,000 credits, Pairri stretches her legs, trying to get eye-level with you.`
			`	You crouch, and she says, "Incapable of arriving on time, a mutual friend of ours was. Available, their ticket is."`
			`	She extends one of her legs to you, holding a small, coin-like piece. It has a symbol like the old Olympic Games on Earth, except with three interlocked rings instead of five.`

			`	"A grand, cooperative match, at the end of it all takes place," Ulmodi further details. "Teams consisting of all three species, formed they are. A joyous, unmatched experience, the last spectacle is."`
			`	Since they need to leave to prepare for the games, they can't tell you about each sport but assure you that you'll like them. You find a Heliarch agent, and they quickly point you to the line where people are checking in with their own tickets. The line must be thousands long, but you barely spend ten minutes in it. The Heliarchs taking care of admissions are incredibly efficient and keep things organized.`
			`	After that, you find yet another Heliarch who shows you where you should go for each competition. Three massive transports, similar in design to old-school bullet trains, each take you to a different 'arena' for a different type of game.`
			`	They also explain that you'll take a separate train to go to the 'grand spectacle' at the end of it all, which will be available for boarding in any one of the three arenas after those matches are done. You thank them for the explanation and decide on which train to take.`

			`	You arrive at a massive, stadium-like structure, only it's actually shaped like a half moon. The place overlooks a huge valley. Many small drones fly over it, transmitting live footage to the dozens of cinema-sized screens for those that can't get a clear view through the glass.`
			`	You notice starting gates on one of the sides of the track. A few minutes pass before an alarm sounds, and the massive crowd roars. The doors open: several Saryd burst from the gates with wheeled machines, similar to chariots, attached to them. They are also carrying bows and arrows.`
			`	The contestants scatter among a variety of paths leading into the increasingly dense forest. Targets appear for a few seconds as the Saryds approach, and they attempt to shoot at them. Eventually, you have to turn and look at the massive monitors, as it becomes impossible to follow the race by looking out the window.`
			`	One participant takes a corner going too fast, and their "chariot" slams into a tree. He slows to a stop and throws his bow into the ground. The drones don't transmit sound, but it's clear from his reaction he's been disqualified. Over the din of the crowd, you hear voices coming through the speakers, likely commentators.`
			`	As they move deeper, tall brambles and ledges become more common among the path, and the targets appear faster and faster. A Saryd navigates one section perfectly, nailing seven different targets in a row. You notice his picture on another monitor rises several positions, putting him near the front. It seems that hitting more targets counts towards a point system.`
			`	You weren't able to count how many started, but as the race approaches its end, you're able to see roughly thirty made it through - not many. As the Saryds cross a finish line marked by a stream, the monitors switch to a ground crew interviewing the finishers.`
			`	It looks like Ulmodi finished fourth; he's up next to be interviewed. The event seems to be over, and the crowd disperses under the supervision of Heliarch agents. Instead of heading back to the train, they're moving to a different section of the oddly-shaped stadium.`
			`	You go with the crowd and are shown to a room with many elevators. Eventually, everyone descends to the valley below and follows a path to an actual, full-size stadium, and a massive one at that.`
			`	As you sit among the alien beings feeling a little out of place, you realize you're probably the first human ever to witness these games. You look over the stadium grounds. It's rectangular, and small mounds dot the field. Six large holes are arranged evenly on the sides of the field.`
			`	Half an hour passes, and a Kimek sitting next to you with a translation device explains that the contestants are resting. A couple more minutes pass before the thirty Saryds, holding what looks like fancy polo mallets, enter the grounds and are divided into six teams of different colors. You see that Ulmodi is on the blue team. Several large spheres are placed at the center of the stadium in a circle, and one member from each team stands around them.`
			`	The game starts. It's some sort of mix between polo, billiards, and golf. The teams trot around for a while, and rapidly rush to the spheres once they see an opening in the others' defenses. As they hit the spheres with their mallets, they roll around the mounds, curving all over and sometimes even accidentally being flung into the audience; fortunately, nets are in place to keep the spheres within the playing area.`
			`	Eventually, a sphere finds its way into a hole, which lights up with the color of the team who scored: red. Much of the crowd jumps up and screams. You're not sure if everyone is a fan of the red team or if they're cheering simply because a point was scored. The sphere is brought back up automatically via a tube close to the hole and it's back in the game.`
			`	The game continues, and each team accumulates a few points. The blue team, leading, scores a fifth point, and the crowd's reaction is the loudest you've seen yet. The entire blue team gathers and celebrates as the commentators begin speaking. The Kimek with the translator explains what is happening.`
			`	"The winning score, they have reached! The winners, the blue team are!" They say, still in a cheering mood. After everyone settles down, the members of the teams are shown on the replay screen, going from the team that scored the least all the way to the blue team at the end. Ulmodi is placed third, which must mean a lot considering him and the other two above him celebrate by running laps around the inside of the stadium.`
			`	After the celebration has died down, the teams gather for a moment of sportsmanship before leaving the arena. The crowd begins to file out.`
			`	You get back to where the train dropped you off and see that another one has arrived on the opposite side. A Heliarch agent explains that it is headed to the final arena where the cooperative game will take place.`

			`	The overly-packed train takes you to a savanna plain with a colossal skyscraper. It looks like a stadium has been vertically stretched tenfold. In the center are several rings held in place by beams connected to the seating area.  Hundreds of Heliarch agents direct the nonstop stream of Kimek entering to their seats in an orderly fashion.`
			`	You ask one of the agents about the multiple 'floors' and rings. They explain that because of the Kimek's disproportionately high population, their own competition sees much higher attendance than the other species. There are twenty floors, and each is big enough to seat a stadium-full.`
			`	"To other floors, at any point you may go," they say. "To the elevators, you must go, if to see another floor, you wish."`
			`	You ask them for a way to find out where Pairri will be competing; seeing as you don't really understand any of this, you should at least stick to a floor where someone you know will be participating.`
			`	They point you to a separate group of agents inside with computers directing the never-ending crowd to their preferred floors. Eventually, they point you to the sixteenth floor, and you head to the elevators. They're just as packed as the train was. After a crowded ride, you find a seat. Among the thousands of Kimek on this floor alone, you spot an occasional group of Arachi or a loner Saryd. Everyone eagerly waits for the match to begin.`
			`	Kimek begin to gather in the arena from extending bridges and are divided into two teams by Heliarchs in the middle. Each team must have several hundred Kimek. The Heliarchs leave, and after a long whistle the two teams charge at one another.`
			`	Within a few seconds, dozens of Kimek have fallen off onto nets on the side where they are helped into the surrounding seats by workers. It looks like a collective sumo match. Another whistle blows after enough have fallen out, and the remaining Kimek stop fighting. Heliarch agents return to the ring and organize those left into two teams again. They depart, and the whistle blows. The fighters have more space to maneuver this time, so almost a minute passes before any fall.`
			`	This process repeats a few more times. Finally, those that remain after several rounds - less than a tenth of those that entered - are gathered in the center. They leave the ring, and you become unsure if the game has ended.`
			`	You feel something tap the top of your head and turn around to see an Arach sitting behind you, "Confused, the human visitor is?" Their little box translates.`
			`	You nod, and they briefly breakdown the competition during this break. "Numerous, the Kimek are, so more athletes, they have," they say. "Over a thousand, at first enter. Redone, the teams are, once in half, that number is cut."`
			`	They further explain that once the number of Kimek in the ring reaches two hundred and fifty, the game doesn't stop until only one hundred remain. The hundred reenter the ring and are paired off for individual matches using miniature rings drawn on the floor. This time they are all wearing what looks like goggles, perhaps as protective gear.`
			`	You find Pairri is set to fight close to where you're sitting, so you get a good view of her fights. While she is short even by Kimek standards, she stands her ground and manages to beat some slightly larger opponents, driving them out of the circular limit of the rink.`
			`	Above the large arena, monitors display the fighters and show their score: fighters that lose a match don't leave, but instead rotate counter-clockwise, fighting others to try and climb back up to the winning spots.`
			`	Eventually, after many of these rounds and rotational swap outs, Pairri and her next opponent wait as the other forty-nine pairs finish their own fights, then move to the center of the field.`
			`	"Undefeated, both of them are," the Arach behind you says. "The floor victor, the winner of this final match will be."`
			`	The whistle sounds again, and Pairri charges at her slightly larger opponent, pressuring them toward the edge. They redirect the force by going to their side, and the fight quickly turns into a battle of attrition near the edge of the ring. Her opponent repositions themself closer to the middle and tries to charge, but she closes the gap. They continue wrestling before Pairri presses the other Kimek towards the border again. Suddenly, her opponent manages to grip her with their frontal legs, and by lifting their own body with the other four, manages to push her off the ground and into the air.`
			`	Both fall outside the ring, but Pairri hits the ground first. You hear the whistle once again, and as they get up and approach each other for what must be the Kimek equivalent of a handshake, it becomes clear that Pairri has lost.`
			`	Heliarch agents make sure everyone leaving the floor proceeds in an orderly fashion, and you take the elevators back down, returning to the entrance. Once again you see another train, and the Arach that talked to you confirms that it leads to where the cooperative game will take place, just before they board the one leading to the Arachi game.`

			`	When the train stops, you find yourself inside a building akin to a spaceport, only the ships are a mix between a helicopter and a raft. Other visitors start boarding the flying platforms, and you approach one of them. The rafts have adjustable seats. Their default position is designed for Arachi, but moving a few parts makes them capable of accommodating Kimeks and even Saryds. You manage to adjust your seat to a configuration that's comfortable for humans.`
			`	Once the 'rafts' are full, they leave their docks and depart the port. You're greeted by a lush rainforest as you leave the building. Massive trees emerge from a carpet of green below that seems to shimmer with the movement of different animals below the brush. Bird-like creatures with funneled beaks, startled by the engines, appear from the canopies in large flocks and soar through the forest. In the distance, there is a river so wide you believed it to be an ocean before a Heliarch agent informed you otherwise.`
			`	You approach a cluster of the colossal trees. Smaller rafts begin to become visible nearby, each with a different symbol on it. The Heliarch agents on your own raft are busy preparing to land, so you ask a Saryd seated next to you what they mean after noticing they're carrying a translation box.`
			`	"The multiple Arach houses, the symbols represent," she says. "To be patrons of athletes, a custom of members of the great houses it is."`
			`	The rafts near the center of the cluster and begin to lower. Now that you're up close, you can make out details you couldn't before: they're similar to oak trees, but have leaves several times larger. Vines hang from the branches, many of which extend to other trees.`
			`	As you get even closer, you realize most are not vines, but ropes: they connect the trees in an intricate, scattered web. Dozens of medium-sized rafts position themselves under the ropes and gather into groups. You can see they're attaching something to the rafts but can't make it out. After a few minutes, they move away, revealing they have attached large nets between rafts that will sit below each rope. Finally, a large raft - perhaps the largest here - orients itself above everyone. Multiple large monitors are attached to its bottom. They display the symbols of the Arachi houses you noticed on the rafts earlier, then a list of participants from each house follows.`
			`	"Damaged, the forest would be, if grand colosseums here were built," the Saryd says. "This setup, every year is prepared. For the games, it is designed."`
			`	The participants' rafts hover near the top of the largest, central tree, and all of them leave, staying at the very top of the crown, as the rafts move away. As the spectator rafts start passing closer to the top of the tree to see the contestants, you spot Tumub amidst the crowd. He sees you, and stands up higher by stretching his legs, perking his head up to say hello. You also notice that there's a symbol painted on the top of his abdomen representing an Arach house. The painting depicts multiple Arach legs interlocked with each other, as if forming a tightly knit web.`
			`	You are told by the Saryd that it is the symbol for house Debdo, the Arach house that specialises in the service industries. They're about to pinpoint the other symbols and tell you which house each one represents, but a short siren goes off, and the contestants start moving down the main tree. You do your best to follow Tumub's movements, yet shortly after the game begins you lose his position as the groups of Arachi all move rapidly to other trees, holding onto the ropes.`
			`	The rope web lets Arachi spread quickly. Some lead directly to the top, but most attach to lower branches with other ropes leading further up the tree. Whenever an Arach reaches the top of the tree, they begin scouring the upper canopy, sometimes nearly burrowing themselves in.`
			`	They eventually find shiny, colored rings among the treetops, which they attach to their legs and then carry on to other trees. There's a variety of methods: some work their way clockwise around the tree, some counterclockwise, and some with no pattern at all, often heading to the central tree and taking a new route.`
			`	A couple Arachi that have already been to three different treetops struggle to cross a straight rope leading to their fourth. Suddenly, their legs give out, and they fall down into the nets below. You notice the Heliarchs in your raft are passing some of the rings around so the spectators can feel their weight themselves. When one is passed to you, you hold it with both arms, yet it still nearly falls down. The Heliarch explains the rings are made with the same alloys used in Arach ship hulls, and are thus incredibly dense and heavy.`
			`	As more and more competitors clear the trees of the needed rings, each needs to retrieve a ring from one every tree.

			`	When the train stops, you find yourself inside a building akin to a spaceport, only the ships are a mix between a helicopter and a raft. Other visitors start boarding the flying platforms, and you approach one of them. The rafts have adjustable seats. Their default position is designed for Arachi, but moving a few parts makes them capable of accommodating Kimeks and even Saryds. You manage to adjust your seat to a configuration that's comfortable for humans.`
			`	Once the 'rafts' are full, they leave their docks and depart the port. You're greeted by a lush rainforest as you leave the building. Massive trees emerge from a carpet of green below that seems to shimmer with the movement of different animals below the brush. Bird-like creatures with funneled beaks, startled by the engines, appear from the canopies in large flocks and soar through the forest. In the distance, there is a river so wide you believed it to be an ocean before a Heliarch agent informed you otherwise.`
			`	You approach a cluster of the colossal trees. Smaller rafts begin to become visible nearby, each with a different symbol on it. The Heliarch agents on your own raft are busy preparing to land, so you ask a Saryd seated next to you what they mean after noticing they're carrying a translation box.`
			`	"The multiple Arach houses, the symbols represent," she says. "To be patrons of athletes, a custom of members of the great houses it is."`
			`	The rafts near the center of the cluster and begin to lower. Now that you're up close, you can make out details you couldn't before: they're similar to oak trees, but have leaves several times larger. Vines hang from the branches, many of which extend to other trees.`
			`	As you get even closer, you realize most are not vines, but ropes: they connect the trees in an intricate, scattered web. Dozens of medium-sized rafts position themselves under the ropes and gather into groups. You can see they're attaching something to the rafts but can't make it out. After a few minutes, they move away, revealing they have attached large nets between rafts that will sit below each rope. Finally, a large raft - perhaps the largest here - orients itself above everyone. Multiple large monitors are attached to its bottom. They display the symbols of the Arachi houses you noticed on the rafts earlier, then a list of participants from each house follows.`
			`	"Damaged, the forest would be, if grand colosseums here were built," the Saryd says. "This setup, every year is prepared. For the games, it is designed."`
			`	The participants' rafts hover near the top of the largest, central tree, and all of them leave, staying at the very top of the crown, as the rafts move away. As the spectator rafts start passing closer to the top of the tree to see the contestants, you spot Tumub amidst the crowd. He sees you, and stands up higher by stretching his legs, perking his head up to say hello. You also notice that there's a symbol painted on the top of his abdomen representing an Arach house. The painting depicts multiple Arach legs interlocked with each other, as if forming a tightly knit web.`
			`	You are told by the Saryd that it is the symbol for house Debdo, the Arach house that specialises in the service industries. They're about to pinpoint the other symbols and tell you which house each one represents, but a short siren goes off, and the contestants start moving down the main tree. You do your best to follow Tumub's movements, yet shortly after the game begins you lose his position as the groups of Arachi all move rapidly to other trees, holding onto the ropes.`
			`	The rope web lets Arachi spread quickly. Some lead directly to the top, but most attach to lower branches with other ropes leading further up the tree. Whenever an Arach reaches the top of the tree, they begin scouring the upper canopy, sometimes nearly burrowing themselves in.`
			`	They eventually find shiny, colored rings among the treetops, which they attach to their legs and then carry on to other trees. There's a variety of methods: some work their way clockwise around the tree, some counterclockwise, and some with no pattern at all, often heading to the central tree and taking a new route.`
			`	A couple Arachi that have already been to three different treetops struggle to cross a straight rope leading to their fourth. Suddenly, their legs give out, and they fall down into the nets below. You notice the Heliarchs in your raft are passing some of the rings around so the spectators can feel their weight themselves. When one is passed to you, you hold it with both arms, yet it still nearly falls down. The Heliarch explains the rings are made with the same alloys used in Arach ship hulls, and are thus incredibly dense and heavy.`
			`	As more and more competitors clear the trees of the needed rings, each needs to retrieve a ring from one every tree. The order at which they approach the trees is part of their strategy: the ropes leading to sections that require climbing are nearly impossible for those with too many rings. Those that successfully collect all their rings without falling return to the center tree. There are thirty left, and Tumub is among them.

In the center are several rings held in place by beams connected to the seating area.  Hundreds of Heliarch agents direct the nonstop stream of Kimek entering to their seats in an orderly fashion.`
			`	You ask one of the agents about the multiple 'floors' and rings. They explain that because of the Kimek's disproportionately high population, their own competition sees much higher attendance than the other species. There are twenty floors, and each is big enough to seat a stadium-full.`
			`	"To other floors, at any point you may go," they say. "To the elevators, you must go, if to see another floor, you wish."`

Among the thousands of Kimek on this floor alone, you spot an occasional group of Arachi or a loner Saryd. Everyone eagerly waits for the match to begin.`

			`	Within a few seconds, dozens of Kimek have fallen off onto nets on the side where they are helped into the surrounding seats by workers. It looks like a collective sumo match. Another whistle blows after enough have fallen out, and the remaining Kimek stop fighting. Heliarch agents return to the ring and organize those left into two teams again. They depart, and the whistle blows. The fighters have more space to maneuver this time, so almost a minute passes before any fall.`
			`	This process repeats a few more times. Finally, those that remain after several rounds - less than a tenth of those that entered - are gathered in the center. They leave the ring, and you become unsure if the game has ended.`
			`	You feel something tap the top of your head and turn around to see an Arach sitting behind you, "Confused, the human visitor is?" Their little box translates.`
			`	You nod, and they briefly breakdown the competition during this break. "Numerous, the Kimek are, so more athletes, they have," they say. "Over a thousand, at first enter. Redone, the teams are, once in half, that number is cut."`
			`	They further explain that once the number of Kimek in the ring reaches two hundred and fifty, the game doesn't stop until only one hundred remain. The hundred reenter the ring and are paired off for individual matches using miniature rings drawn on the floor. This time they are all wearing what looks like goggles, perhaps as protective gear.`
			`	You find Pairri is set to fight close to where you're sitting, so you get a good view of her fights. While she is short even by Kimek standards, she stands her ground and manages to beat some slightly larger opponents, driving them out of the circular limit of the rink.`
			`	Above the large arena, monitors display the fighters and show their score: fighters that lose a match don't leave, but instead rotate counter-clockwise, fighting others to try and climb back up to the winning spots.`
			`	Eventually, after many of these rounds and rotational swap outs, Pairri and her next opponent wait as the other forty-nine pairs finish their own fights, then move to the center of the field.`

Suddenly, her opponent manages to grip her with their frontal legs, and by lifting their own body with the other four, manages to push her off the ground and into the air.`

			`	You arrive at a massive, stadium-like structure, only it's actually shaped like a half moon. The place overlooks a huge valley. Many small drones fly over it, transmitting live footage to the dozens of cinema-sized screens for those that can't get a clear view through the glass.`
			`	You notice starting gates on one of the sides of the track. A few minutes pass before an alarm sounds, and the massive crowd roars. The doors open: several Saryd burst from the gates with wheeled machines, similar to chariots, attached to them. They are also carrying bows and arrows.`
			`	The contestants scatter among a variety of paths leading into the increasingly dense forest. Targets appear for a few seconds as the Saryds approach, and they attempt to shoot at them. Eventually, you have to turn and look at the massive monitors, as it becomes impossible to follow the race by looking out the window.`
			`	One participant takes a corner going too fast, and their "chariot" slams into a tree. He slows to a stop and throws his bow into the ground. The drones don't transmit sound, but it's clear from his reaction he's been disqualified. Over the din of the crowd, you hear voices coming through the speakers, likely commentators.`
			`	As they move deeper, tall brambles and ledges become more common among the path, and the targets appear faster and faster. A Saryd navigates one section perfectly, nailing seven different targets in a row. You notice his picture on another monitor rises several positions, putting him near the front. It seems that hitting more targets counts towards a point system.`
			`	You weren't able to count how many started, but as the race approaches its end, you're able to see roughly thirty made it through - not many. As the Saryds cross a finish line marked by a stream, the monitors switch to a ground crew interviewing the finishers.`
			`	It looks like Ulmodi finished fourth; he's up next to be interviewed. The event seems to be over, and the crowd disperses under the supervision of Heliarch agents. Instead of heading back to the train, they're moving to a different section of the oddly-shaped stadium.`
			`	You go with the crowd and are shown to a room with many elevators. Eventually, everyone descends to the valley below and follows a path to an actual, full-size stadium, and a massive one at that.`
			`	As you sit among the alien beings feeling a little out of place, you realize you're probably the first human ever to witness these games. You look over the stadium grounds. It's rectangular, and small mounds dot the field. Six large holes are arranged evenly on the sides of the field.`
			`	Half an hour passes, and a Kimek sitting next to you with a translation device explains that the contestants are resting. A couple more minutes pass before the thirty Saryds, holding what looks like fancy polo mallets, enter the grounds and are divided into six teams of different colors. You see that Ulmodi is on the blue team. Several large spheres are placed at the center of the stadium in a circle, and one member from each team stands around them.`
			`	The game starts. It's some sort of mix between polo, billiards, and golf. The teams trot around for a while, and rapidly rush to the spheres once they see an opening in the others' defenses. As they hit the spheres with their mallets, they roll around the mounds, curving all over and sometimes even accidentally being flung into the audience; fortunately, nets are in place to keep the spheres within the playing area.`
			`	Eventually, a sphere finds its way into a hole, which lights up with the color of the team who scored: red. Much of the crowd jumps up and screams. You're not sure if everyone is a fan of the red team or if they're cheering simply because a point was scored. The sphere is brought back up automatically via a tube close to the hole and it's back in the game.`
			`	The game continues, and each team accumulates a few points. The blue team, leading, scores a fifth point, and the crowd's reaction is the loudest you've seen yet. The entire blue team gathers and celebrates as the commentators begin speaking. The Kimek with the translator explains what is happening.`
			`	"The winning score, they have reached! The winners, the blue team are!" They say, still in a cheering mood. After everyone settles down, the members of the teams are shown on the replay screen, going from the team that scored the least all the way to the blue team at the end. Ulmodi is placed third, which must mean a lot considering him and the other two above him celebrate by running laps around the inside of the stadium.`
			`	After the celebration has died down, the teams gather for a moment of sportsmanship before leaving the arena. The crowd begins to file out.`
			`	You get back to where the train dropped you, and see that the cooperative game train is ready to depart too. The Kimek that spoke to you finds you again, and says farewell as they head into the train leading to the Arachi game.`

			`	They eventually find shiny, colored rings among the treetops, which they attach to their legs and then carry on to other trees. There's a variety of methods: some work their way clockwise around the tree, some counterclockwise, and some with no pattern at all, often heading to the central tree and taking a new route.`
			`	A couple Arachi that have already been to three different treetops struggle to cross a straight rope leading to their fourth. Suddenly, their legs give out, and they fall down into the nets below. You notice the Heliarchs in your raft are passing some of the rings around so the spectators can feel their weight themselves. When one is passed to you, you hold it with both arms, yet it still nearly falls down. The Heliarch explains the rings are made with the same alloys used in Arach ship hulls, and are thus incredibly dense and heavy.`
			`	As more and more competitors clear the trees of the needed rings, each needs to retrieve a ring from one every tree. The order at which they approach the trees is part of their strategy: the ropes leading to sections that require climbing are nearly impossible for those with too many rings. Those that successfully collect all their rings without falling return to the center tree. There are thirty left, and Tumub is among them. The rings are removed, and a scoreboard ranks the competitors by the time it took for them to collect all the rings. Tumub is placed fifth.`
			`	The thirty that completed the course are given heavy suits of armor carried by three separate cargo rafts. As they don the bulky suits, the rafts holding the nets below the ropes rearrange themselves and their nets to form a long, straight line. Two larger rafts approach the middle with a thin, metallic pipe connecting them. The Arachi are placed on the pipe and must balance themselves with their armor as long as possible.` 
			`	"A test of one's endurance, this stage is," the Saryd says. "Proud of both their ships' and their own resilience, the Arachi are. To hold on the longest, the objective is." All are able to stay on for roughly a minute, but soon the competitors begin falling one after another. After two minutes, only four are left, but even they fall before another fifteen seconds pass.`
			`	After the results are merged, Tumub has climbed to second. He, along with the other Arachi in the top twenty, celebrate enthusiastically. Dark storm clouds are rapidly approaching the cluster of trees, so it isn't long before everyone is on rafts returning to the port.`
			`	When you step off the raft, you see that aside from the train that brought you here, the one to the final games is also parked. As she leaves the raft too, the Saryd that was sitting next to you says she'll be heading to the Saryd games now, and leaves for the train.`

			`	You go with the crowd and are shown to a room with many elevators. Eventually, everyone descends to the valley below and follows a path to an actual, full-size stadium, and a massive one at that.`
			`	As you sit among the alien beings feeling a little out of place, you realize you're probably the first human ever to witness these games. You look over the stadium grounds. It's rectangular, and small mounds dot the field. Six large holes are arranged evenly on the sides of the field.`
			`	Half an hour passes, and a Kimek sitting next to you with a translation device explains that the contestants are resting. A couple more minutes pass before the thirty Saryds, holding what looks like fancy polo mallets, enter the grounds and are divided into six teams of different colors. You see that Ulmodi is on the blue team. Several large spheres are placed at the center of the stadium in a circle, and one member from each team stands around them.`
			`	The game starts. It's some sort of mix between polo, billiards, and golf. The teams trot around for a while, and rapidly rush to the spheres once they see an opening in the others' defenses. As they hit the spheres with their mallets, they roll around the mounds, curving all over and sometimes even accidentally being flung into the audience; fortunately, nets are in place to keep the spheres within the playing area.`
			`	Eventually, a sphere finds its way into a hole, which lights up with the color of the team who scored: red. Much of the crowd jumps up and screams. You're not sure if everyone is a fan of the red team or if they're cheering simply because a point was scored. The sphere is brought back up automatically via a tube close to the hole and it's back in the game.`
			`	The game continues, and each team accumulates a few points. The blue team, leading, scores a fifth point, and the crowd's reaction is the loudest you've seen yet. The entire blue team gathers and celebrates as the commentators begin speaking. The Kimek with the translator explains what is happening.`
			`	"The winning score, they have reached! The winners, the blue team are!" They say, still in a cheering mood. After everyone settles down, the members of the teams are shown on the replay screen, going from the team that scored the least all the way to the blue team at the end. Ulmodi is placed third, which must mean a lot considering him and the other two above him celebrate by running laps around the inside of the stadium.`

			`	When the train stops, you find yourself inside a building akin to a spaceport, only the ships are a mix between a helicopter and a raft. Other visitors start boarding the flying platforms, and you approach one of them. The rafts have adjustable seats. Their default position is designed for Arachi, but moving a few parts makes them capable of accommodating Kimeks and even Saryds. You manage to adjust your seat to a configuration that's comfortable for humans.`
			`	Once the 'rafts' are full, they leave their docks and depart the port. You're greeted by a lush rainforest as you leave the building. Massive trees emerge from a carpet of green below that seems to shimmer with the movement of different animals below the brush. Bird-like creatures with funneled beaks, startled by the engines, appear from the canopies in large flocks and soar through the forest. In the distance, there is a river so wide you believed it to be an ocean before a Heliarch agent informed you otherwise.`
			`	You approach a cluster of the colossal trees. Smaller rafts begin to become visible nearby, each with a different symbol on it. The Heliarch agents on your own raft are busy preparing to land, so you ask a Saryd seated next to you what they mean after noticing they're carrying a translation box.`
			`	"The multiple Arach houses, the symbols represent," she says. "To be patrons of athletes, a custom of members of the great houses it is."`
			`	The rafts near the center of the cluster and begin to lower. Now that you're up close, you can make out details you couldn't before: they're similar to oak trees, but have leaves several times larger. Vines hang from the branches, many of which extend to other trees.`
			`	As you get even closer, you realize most are not vines, but ropes: they connect the trees in an intricate, scattered web. Dozens of medium-sized rafts position themselves under the ropes and gather into groups. You can see they're attaching something to the rafts but can't make it out. After a few minutes, they move away, revealing they have attached large nets between rafts that will sit below each rope. Finally, a large raft - perhaps the largest here - orients itself above everyone. Multiple large monitors are attached to its bottom. They display the symbols of the Arachi houses you noticed on the rafts earlier, then a list of participants from each house follows.`
			`	"Damaged, the forest would be, if grand colosseums here were built," the Saryd says. "This setup, every year is prepared. For the games, it is designed."`
			`	The participants' rafts hover near the top of the largest, central tree, and all of them leave, staying at the very top of the crown, as the rafts move away. As the spectator rafts start passing closer to the top of the tree to see the contestants, you spot Tumub amidst the crowd. He sees you, and stands up higher by stretching his legs, perking his head up to say hello. You also notice that there's a symbol painted on the top of his abdomen representing an Arach house. The painting depicts multiple Arach legs interlocked with each other, as if forming a tightly knit web.`
			`	You are told by the Saryd that it is the symbol for house Debdo, the Arach house that specialises in the service industries. They're about to pinpoint the other symbols and tell you which house each one represents, but a short siren goes off, and the contestants start moving down the main tree. You do your best to follow Tumub's movements, yet shortly after the game begins you lose his position as the groups of Arachi all move rapidly to other trees, holding onto the ropes.`

			`	The game continues, and each team accumulates a few points. The blue team, leading, scores a fifth point, and the crowd's reaction is the loudest you've seen yet. The entire blue team gathers and celebrates as the commentators begin speaking. The Kimek with the translator explains what is happening.`
			`	"The winning score, they have reached! The winners, the blue team are!" They say, still in a cheering mood. After everyone settles down, the members of the teams are shown on the replay screen, going from the team that scored the least all the way to the blue team at the end. Ulmodi is placed third, which must mean a lot considering him and the other two above him celebrate by running laps around the inside of the stadium.`
			`	After the celebration has died down, the teams gather for a moment of sportsmanship before leaving the arena. The crowd begins to file out.`
			`	You get back to where the train dropped you, and see that the cooperative game train is ready to depart too. The Kimek that spoke to you finds you again, and says farewell as they head into the train leading to the final game.`

				`	(Take the last train.)`

			`	This train is larger than the others you've seen today, and its design mimics Heliarch warships in its meshing of Coalition styles. It takes you to an area similar to a spaceport where you board one of the few hundred ring-shaped flying rafts. As you sit down, you notice the seats, which face the inside of the ring, are mobile. You can't help but feel uneasy being on a gigantic alien roundabout that doesn't seem to match any safety regulations you know of.`
			`	As you're watching the mechanics here perform various safety checks on the raft, you hear what you by now recognize as Kimek speech from the seat to your right.`
			`	"Enjoyed the games, have you, Captain?" The small box translates just as you turn around, seeing that Pairri has taken her own seat besides yours. "Spectating my earlier match, you were, yes?"`
			choice
				`	"Yeah, you did pretty good."`
					goto prettygood
				`	"Wait, why are you up here with the viewers?"`

			`	She starts to say something else, but the ring begins taking off, leaving the docks. Out in the open, you're overlooking a massive track separated from the rest of the wilderness by a perfectly rectangular border of trees. Immediately under you are the contestants in twenty groups of three. As the ring ascends, small monitors light up in front of you, and Pairri inputs the a command for yours to focus on Tumub and Ulmodi, who, conveniently, happen to be in the same group.`
			`	Up above, you can finally see the entire stage: a long, mostly flat stretch of land, leading to a rocky wall, cuts to form a perfect right angle with the ground. At the top, there is a river bank with many logs laid on the ground. The river itself is not terribly big, but the current seems to be potent enough that the boats moving around the waters have some difficulty turning at times.`
			`	The twenty teams line up. The Saryds are attached to a chariot carrying the other two members of each team. Zooming in on Tumub, you see that he is helping the Kimek of their group check a bag with some tools. He has a similar bag on his back.`
			`	"In many ways we differ, when it comes to physical form," Pairri speaks to you. "Different tasks, each member is assigned. For the sake of fairness, it is so."`
			choice
				`	"What are they carrying in those bags?"`
				`	"So is pulling those chariots the 'task' of the Saryds?"`
			`	A loud airhorn interrupts Pairri as she is about to answer, and the Saryds start galloping toward the wall. The Kimeks and Arachi of each chariot do their best to stay on, as their Saryd teammates give their all to the race.`
			`	The Saryds have to begin breaking two thirds of the way to the wall to avoid crashing into it. It's still a very tight race as every team reaches the wall. The Saryds immediately lay down to rest as the Arachi unstrap the chariots. Meanwhile, the Kimeks are already climbing the wall, carrying their small bags.`
			`	Before long, all have reached the top. They open their bags and pull out a multitude of tools and rope.`
			`	"To cross the river, one of the goals of the game is," says Pairri. "To build the raft, the Kimek's task is is."`
			`	Back at the bottom, the Arachi are preparing for the climb. Each has a large piece of cloth attached to some elastic-like fabric which they wear over their bodies like climbing equipment. The Saryds climb in the cloth, and after a few short test climbs for stability, the Arachi start climbing.`
			`	Tumub's movements appear very calculated. Never having more than one leg not touching the wall at a time and carefully looking for the best spots to anchor himself on, he continues carrying Ulmodi's much larger frame up the stone barrier.`
			`	As soon as they finish the climb, the Saryds get up, unstrap the fabric from the Arachi, and start carrying their exhausted companions toward the now nearly complete raft. The Saryds lay the Arachi beside the raft and help the Kimeks properly secure the ropes. The Kimek and Saryds help the Arachi get on and start pushing the raft to the lake. The Saryds get onto them shortly before they touch the water, and the Kimek wait until the last second.`
			`	After focusing on Ulmodi and Tumub for a while, you notice that the Kimek from their group has picked up three small paddles and is working to fight the river's flow. Ulmodi grabs a tool that looks like a combination between a shovel and pickaxe from its spot wedged between two logs. He uses the pick side to grab onto some rocks sticking up and pulls, tilting the boat back on course.`
			`	About halfway across, Tumub has caught his breath and is manning the sail. Standing up on two legs, he opens it up and skillfully manages it using the ropes, altering the direction of the sail to better adapt to the changing needs of the turbulent vessel.`
			`	As you and Pairri cheer for the group, you notice that not everyone is having the same success crossing. Two rafts, unable to fight the stream, have drifted dangerously far down the river. Heliarch boats speed toward them, rescuing the competitors before anyone is hurt.`
			`	In total, eighteen teams make it across the river. The race was extremely close the whole time, but Ulmodi, Tumub, and their Kimek parter win second place by a hair. The competitors celebrate with their team and later gather to commend their opponents while the crowd cheers in all three Coalition languages.`
			`	Everyone grows quiet, however, as three Heliarch Punishers land right in front of the athletes. One Heliarch, wearing the same type of circlet you saw in the Ring of Friendship, emerges from each ship, presumably their captains. There is one Arach, one Saryd, and one Kimek.`
			`	"Deemed worthy, some have been. The winners, the Heliarchs shall now announce," Pairri says. As the Heliarchs start speaking, she tries to summarize and let the box translate it, but the device is unable to keep up with the rate at which she speaks. Judging by the audience's reaction during pauses, they must be giving some sort of grand finale speech.`
			`	After they finish, the monitor switches to a black screen, which after a moment displays live footage of one of the athletes, a Kimek. A Saryd is next, then another Kimek, followed by an Arach. Tumub's and Ulmodi's faces are shown next, and Pairri makes a sound that you think sounds like an excited scream - or, at least, a Kimek version of such a thing.`
			`	"Selected, my friends have been!" She says. "Made it, they have!"`
			`	A few more words are said after the crowd has settled, and the six that were selected are invited into the Punishers. Pairri explains they are being considered for the rank of Heliarch and will go to the Ring of Friendship to continue their journey.`
			`	The ring platforms head back to the building, and as you and Pairri say your goodbyes, you take the train back to the previous arena, and from there to where your ship is docked at.`
