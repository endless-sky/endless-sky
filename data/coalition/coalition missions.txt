On many Coalition worlds, all three species live together in harmony, which is made easier by the fact that each species prefers a very different climate and thus gravitates to different parts of a planet. They are ruled by individuals known as the Heliarchs.`
		conversation
			`This planet seems to be inhabited by at least three different sentient species. First are giant beetles, about a meter tall, who scurry quickly toward your ship and swarm around it, gawking at you, as soon as you land. The second species, even more disturbing than the beetles, are giant spiders. And the third species are centaurs. Not just something vaguely resembling centaurs; they look like they could have stepped right off the page of a story book from ancient Earth.`
			`	One of the spiders walks up to you, stretching its legs to raise its face and many eyes to the level of your own face, and says something to you in a gloopy sort of burbling language that you don't understand. The beetles, meanwhile, are talking to each other in a different language, all clicks and chittering. And the centaur stands quietly at a distance and keeps glancing back toward the spaceport as if waiting for someone.`
			`	And eventually, someone does arrive: a beetle, a spider, and a centaur all wearing yellow armbands and some sort of electric box hanging on a chain around each of their necks. They walk up to you, and the centaur speaks. After a brief delay, the box around its neck says, "In the name of the Heliarchs, who drove out the oppressors, who maintain peace, we the human visitor greet."`
			choice
				`	"Thank you."`
					goto next
				`	"How do you know my language?"`
			`	The spider speaks, and the box around its neck translates. "Our nearest and most recent neighbor you are. The Heliarchs in their great wisdom, all things that come to pass in our region of space, they are aware of."`
			label next
			`	Speaking through its own translation box, the beetle says, "To the seat of the Heliarch government must you go. Once to the Heliarchs you have become known, in many ways to our society, contribute you may."`
			`	The centaur pulls out a map printed on a thin sheet of plastic. You recognize it as a star map of this region. Lines mark out three different territories, and where they meet are three star systems colored yellow. The centaur points to the southernmost of the three. "Where you must go, here it is," it says.`
			choice
				`	"Thank you. I will go there."`
					goto end
				`	"Can you tell me more about yourselves, first?"`
			`	The spider says, "The wise Heliarchs, all your questions they will answer."`
			label end
			`	Eventually the crowd disperses and allows you to visit the spaceport, although no one offers you any jobs or the opportunity to buy anything but basic commodities. Perhaps you need to register with the "Heliarchs" first.`

Thousands of years ago, the Heliarchs led their three species to band together and drive the Quarg out of Coalition space. The Heliarch centers of government are the three Quarg ringworlds that they captured in that war. They are the only ones in Coalition space who are allowed to have weapons on their starships, and they act as a sort of police force, maintaining peace between the Coalition species.`

But no Quarg are present here, only the three species of the Coalition. Soon after you land, a delegation approaches your ship: again, one of each species, but these are wearing golden circlets around their heads. The circlets are not merely decorative, but seem to contain some electronics as well.`
			`	Again, the centaur speaks first. "To our territory, to welcome you we are glad," it says.`

For six thousand Earth years now, in prosperity and freedom from Quarg constraint and in friendship with each other we have lived."`

"A second Coalition you are forming!" says the centaur, tapping its hooves on the floor in excitement. "Once again, foiled the Quarg are. A secret way for species to work together, they have overlooked. Great things, from this may come."`

			`	They tell you that the best way to learn more about them is to visit their worlds, and to see for yourself how the three species live in friendship and equality. They also offer to give you jobs to do in their territory, so that you may become a "valuable contributor" to their society.`

Stepping off of your ship you're greeted by what is unmistakably an outfitter, and as you look around you spot some other large buildings dotting the surrounding area, with members of the Coalition going to and from them. The atmosphere feels like that of a small village turned into an outdoor shopping mall.`
			`	Shortly after landing you're greeted by an Arach wearing what you judge to be some sort of uniform. He takes a translation device out of his pocket and formally greets you. "Honored to have you as a guest, the great House Mallob is, Captain <first> <last>."`

You follow him along the path, and he gives a bit more detail on some of the buildings as you walk near them. What really piques your interest though is that one of the buildings, which he seemed to willingly ignore, had armed guards at the door, with no indication of being members of the Heliarch.`
			`	Reaching the entrance of the mansion, it isn't as castle-like as the walls, but it all still looks strangely pompous. Up close it almost looks like all the several parts and pods of an Arach Hulk or two were crumpled together into one single building.`
			`	He guides you through the mansion. You pass by several other servants, notice rooms where he mentions that members of House Mallob are having meetings, and even meet a group of Saryd and Kimek students who came here to study with the shipwrights of House Mallob.`

		conversation
			`You're window-browsing a shop in the spaceport when you catch the scuff of too quick footsteps coming towards you. Before you can glance in that direction, you're suddenly tackled into the ground by someone astonishingly human-shaped. You try to get up, but whoever attacked you pins you down, pressing your face into the ground and holding your arms behind your back to restrain you. As you struggle against your attacker you manage to catch sight of long hair and then, with a flash of concern, a glimpse of green skin - an Alpha.`
			`	You are not pressed for long though. You feel the Alpha's attention shift to the side you cannot see, as an Arach swoops in with a tackle. The Alpha lets go of your arms in an attempt to block the attack, but it does not prevent the Arach from bowling them clear off of you where the two begin to wrestle in your line of sight. The Alpha is a man and, surprisingly to you, despite his strength, it doesn't take long for the Arach Heliarch to restrain your attacker. The Arach firmly pins his arms to his torso with four legs, holds his hips down with two, and uses her last pair to lever herself until she rests her entire body weight into pinning the Alpha.`
			`	A Saryd Heliarch approaches and tells you to keep your distance before interposing himself partially between you and your assailant. He then looks at the Alpha and asks through his translator box, "What reason for attacking this person, did you have?"`
			`	The Alpha is still struggling to try and get out of the Arach's grip, and you notice an intricate gold necklace which has splayed across his shoulder and onto the floor in the scuffle, jangling in the quiet every time he struggles. At this point, everyone else has cleared out of the area and is giving the scene a wide berth. As you get to your feet he ignores the Saryd's question and looks at you intensely. "You're with the Navy, aren't you? Finally figured out I was here, thought you'd finish the job?"`

			`	"And I'm supposed to believe that crap?" He lashes out, trying again to knock the Arach off of him, but the agent only tightens the grip. She opens her mandibles, getting them close to the Alpha's neck. "Alright, alright, I get it!" the Alpha shouts, stopping his attempts to break free.`
				goto detained
			label notnavy
			`	He stares at you for a moment, as if unsure if you're telling the truth. "What the hell are you doing here then? Did you just stumble onto this place?" He stops struggling, but the Arach agent doesn't loosen her grip.`
			label detained
			`	The Saryd walks closer to the Alpha, stomping his hoofs on the ground with each step. "Whatever your motivation was, a transgression, you have committed. Punished accordingly, you shall be," he says. "Kindly follow us to the detention facility, would you, Captain?" he asks you, but doesn't wait for an answer, as more agents arrive to escort you and the Alpha to the "detention facility."`
			`	On your way there, you start feeling stings on your arms and legs, and realize the Alpha's tackle left you with some bruises. "Treat those, we will, after faced trial, your aggressor has," the Saryd says as you approach your destination: a building similar to a police station. The Alpha is brought before a Kimek that you guess is in charge of the facility. He asks you to give a testimony of what happened, with the Heliarch agents confirming what you say. "Your first offense in a long time this is, Alitis," the Kimek says, after checking a computer for the Alpha's data. "Three years in seclusion, your sentence is."`
			`	After the short verdict, which seems to lack much of the due process you would expect in human space, the agents bring both you and the Alpha to a lower level of the building. This floor has several empty cells kept shut by thick, tough walls of some transparent material. While the cell block does appear to go further beyond this section and around a corner, the first few cells appear to be directly opposite a modest medical space, presumably used mostly for treating any injured prisoners without leaving the secure level. At present though, all of the cells appear to be empty, and the Heliarchs simply lock him in the second cell, where accessing his would not obstruct any other doorways. The agents then ask that you wait a few minutes for a medic to arrive so that they can take care of your bruises.`
			`	You notice that cut into the transparent material of the walls are a series of small holes at head-height with a cover that can be slid across them, presumably to silence a prisoner if needed. By default, they appear to be left open, and the Heliarch agents have not closed the one on the Alpha's cell.`
			`	Your eyes shift from the holes in the wall to the Alpha to find his eyes fixated on you, not looking away or even blinking. After you stare him down for a couple of seconds, he speaks up. "What is it, are you expecting some sort of apology? I'd consider my caution to be entirely justified, so you won't get one."`
			choice
				`	"Who are you? How did you even get here?"`
				`	"What are you doing here in the Coalition?"`
			`	He frowns at you. "I don't owe you any answers, cur. Shut up and wait for the law to bring the frail princess some band-aids and a lollipop."`
			choice
				`	"Are you so busy in that empty cell that you can't answer me?"`
				`	"Tough talk for someone who wrestled a spider and lost."`
			`	He leans forward, his legs twitching as if stopped mid-tackle, and he pauses, turning to look down the hallway to where the Heliarchs went. He backs up, slowing his breathing, and then sits down. "Alright. This may be the last time in three years I can have a proper conversation, so I will entertain you. My name... is Alitis. Over a century ago my kin stumbled upon an alien civilization beyond the Far North in conflict with bands of invaders. These invaders possessed drive capable of jumping between systems without the need for hyperspace links, technology that we greatly desired, for it could put us far outside of the reach of... you." He fixates his eyes on yours, ever so slightly closing his eyelids. "We explored the far reaches of the galaxy to the east, but found no place to call home. Our only choice was to return to the Dirt Belt where we knew of an enclave of more kin, only for the Navy," he spits on the ground, then looks at you again, "to find us. We evacuated, and my kin thought it wise to return to the east, but I knew better. I stole one of the drives my kin had along with a small ship and began traveling west. That is when I discovered the Coalition, and they have provided for me a home that I have been unable to find elsewhere in the galaxy."`
			choice
				`	"You 'knew better?' What do you mean?"`
				`	"What, did you have a change of heart once you got here?"`
			`	He gets up in a rush. "Full of questions, aren't you?" He approaches the wall again, in slow steps. "I was among the first of my kind. Athis, I was called then. I have traveled the galaxy for many centuries and witnessed many things. I have been ambushed, cornered many times; fear was not a stranger to me, for as soulless as your kind see me, we still feel. But when I traveled to the east, someone, or... something, rather, spoke to me. A voice with an immense weight. And for the first time, I felt something more than fear. I felt dread. So when my kin decided to return to the east, I was not so inclined to return with them."`
			choice
				`	"Voices in your head? Are you sure you weren't just imagining them?"`
					goto imaginary
				`	"What did the voice say?"`
			`	He looks away from you. "You're here now, aren't you? This means you must have a device to jump beyond links as I did. Travel to the east and find out for yourself what the voices say. Find out if it classifies you as 'disposable' as well.`
				goto end
			label imaginary
			`	He looks away from you. "No imaginary thing could have such an impact on me. You're here now, aren't you? This means you must have a device to jump beyond links as I did. Travel to the east and find out for yourself that the voices are real."`
			label end
			`	The Heliarchs inform you that the medic has arrived, and bring you further down the hallway to a room where they treat your bruises. They examine you briefly, then give you a tube with a thick liquid, almost like a gel, asking that you gently apply it on your wounds. Once you're done, they tell you that the pain should wear off within a few minutes, and an agent escorts you back out. Passing by his cell again, you see Alitis still standing with his back to the hallway, looking straight at the wall. The agent brings you to your ship, and thanks you for your cooperation.`

The trail brings you to a large clearing, where dozens of Saryds are gathered by a circle of tall, rocky pillars with an altar at the center. Many of the Saryds there are dressed in delicate fabrics of dark greens or ochre colors. Some of them are grouped into pairs that seem to be young couples, while others appear to simply be passing visitors to the shrine.`

At this point, the Saryds all look around the clearing, making space for Vellorae as they see her approaching the shrine. She places the bangle atop the altar so it catches the sun's light, reflecting it throughout the clearing. Vellorae then begins walking around the altar, repeatedly circling it as the sun climbs higher, until it finally reaches its peak and the sun's reflection on the gem is strongest. At this point, she approaches the altar again and covers the bangle with her hands. She remains there silently for a moment, and then she retrieves the bangle and leaves the shrine. As she walks past, the other Saryds give her sympathetic looks, and one of the younger ones even approaches to offer her condolences before Vellorae approaches you again.`

			`<origin>'s spaceport searchlights guide you to the hangars in the middle of a thunderstorm, and Vellorae says she'll wait it out inside your ship as she pays you 45,500 credits. "At her shrine only after dusk, Magl Ina is anyway, so in a hurry, I am not." The storm lasts halfway into the evening, and once the light reaching through the layers of fog starts to dim, you open your ship's hatch for Vellorae to head out.`
			`	You accompany her across the murky spaceport, until you find a local Saryd for her to talk to. Vellorae asks him if he would guide the two of you to the shrine. "To a site of worship, why is this human going?" he asks, while eyeing you somewhat suspiciously.`
			`	"On a pilgrimage to mourn my late husband, I am." Vellorae says. "Helping me with traveling to each shrine, Captain <last> is."`
			`	"But, to the shrine, must the Captain go?" He asks. "Help you with mourning there, a human cannot."`

			`	"Wonderful!" she cheers, tapping her frontal hooves lightly on the ground. "Now, guide us to the shrine, would you, young dear?" she asks the local Saryd, who turns around and gestures for you to follow.`
			`	You stick close to Vellorae as the two of you try to keep the local Saryd in sight. The task is difficult as he nearly vanishes into the fog whenever he gets too far ahead, only for his silhouette to become clearer again after he waits for you to catch up. After many minutes, you feel the ground beneath your shoes shift from the solid spaceport platform to gravel to wet patches of the planet's mossy "grass." Finally you reach a minuscule lake, or perhaps a very large puddle, in the middle of a mossy field surrounded by toppled and hollowed out tree trunks.`
			`	As the two of you approach the water, the local Saryd warns you not to touch it. Vellorae looks at it as if gazing into a mirror, or perhaps she is just trying to make out the reflection of the moon, scattered and vague through the layers of mist. She then moves to one of the tree trunks, and placing the bangle inside it as she lays on the ground facing the water, lays both her hands reverently on the trunk. She spends nearly an hour in this position, during which the chill of the fog slowly seeps through your coat and into your bones. Vellorae and the Saryd who guided you don't seem particularly bothered by it, but she is quick to finish once she looks over and notices you shivering. She picks the bangle up from the trunk and stands, and then asks the other Saryd to guide you two back to the spaceport.`
			`	"For taking so long, terribly sorry I am, Captain <last>," she says on the way back. "Lost in prayer I was, not even consider how uncomfortable the cold must've been for you, I did."`

				`	"Don't worry, wasn't too bad. Seems you were really involved in praying."`

			`	You follow the Saryd back to the gravel path and then to the spaceport grounds, where Vellorae thanks him for guiding the two of you to the shrine. He offers his condolences and wishes her a safe journey to the next shrine. He soon disappears into the fog again, and you and Vellorae head back to your ship.`

			`Vellorae hands you 69,700 credits as you land, and says she'll head to the "path" once the sun sets. "Come to this world for our honeymoon, Adfices and I did, and visited the path, we had. Know its starting point, I already do."`

					goto notgo
			`	She takes you around the spaceport city, touring some clothing shops and bringing you to parks she had visited with her husband. Shortly after noon you two enter a restaurant, where she insists on paying for your meal. You tour the city with her for a while longer and, just before the sun sets, reach the forest at the base of the mountain on top of which Starlit University is located.`
			`	Once night falls, many lights start to appear inside the forest, and Vellorae beckons you to follow her in. "Stick close, you should. Difficult to navigate the path, for other species it often is." As you walk down a trail with her, you approach one of the lights to see that it's a bonfire on a platform in a miniature clearing, at what you hope is a safe distance from the trees around it. Continuing to the next light, Vellorae clutches the bangle in her hands the entire time, humming some guttural, almost tribal chant. As you pass by another fire, a short burst of flames gets closer to some nearby shrubs, but thankfully is put out before it can cause any harm. It is extinguished with an odd, large, fabric net on a pole by a cloaked Saryd who seemed to materialize from the trees near the fire.`
			`	"Take care to not damage the forest with the path's fires, we must, so volunteer for keeping the flames, many of the local students do." Vellorae tells you. "When visiting here, Adfices and I were, wondered if any extra credits, the task granted, but apparently only out of a respect for Lor Ie Vees, the students do it."`

			`	"Taught the first Saryds how to hunt, he did. To pursue knowledge, and overcome challenges, his teachings are." She explains. "Seek communion with him, not only students, but all going through a difficult period, should."`
			`	You continue to follow her closely through the forest, regularly passing more bonfires, until you see multiple lights in the distance and realize it is the edge of the forest leading back into the city. Only as you step out of the woods do you notice that you're back where the path started, even though you were certain you had kept to only one side of the mountain.`
			`	Vellorae takes a final look at the path, where only a few of the bonfires' lights are still visible through the dense groupings of pine trees. She tells you she's ready to leave, and you bring her back to your ship.`

			`	She says she'll be back at night and leaves. You watch a few transmissions from the planet, most of them in some way related to Starlit University.

You try and follow along, but subtitles for the transmissions only come in Kimek or Arach. A few hours into the night, you leave your ship to wait for Vellorae, who arrives shortly after.`

A few seconds into the conversation, they tense up, crossing their arms and swiping them down as if refusing something, then running off. She tries again with some of the other Saryds, but continues to be rejected. She looks back at your ship dejectedly, then starts eyeing the other ships docked nearby before heading towards a Kimek Thorn that has just landed. As she talks to the captain, the Kimek seems confused, but after a moment he briefly reenters their ship, returning in a puffy coat to follow Vellorae to the railway hub.`

			`	She takes a long, deep breath. "Thank you, Captain. Far outside the village, the site is. Come, show you the way there, I will." You leave your ship, follow her to the railway hub, and board one of trains that appears to be one of the oldest and most simple. It lacks seats for non-Saryds, so you are forced to hold tight to what handrails you can reach.`
			`	You remain on the train until the very last stop, when the sun is already starting to set. As you depart, you see a rural village with just a few dozen buildings and a simple dirt road, where a couple workers battle the snow and ice to keep it clear and easy to traverse. You follow Vellorae down the road, and once you reach a rocky pillar with a hole carved through it, she turns to the forest, heading out on a thin, straight trail. Looking behind you, you see the setting sun fitting inside the pillar's opening.`
			`	As you follow Vellorae down the trail, you see the trees gradually show more and more signs of a forest fire, with darker, damaged barks, increasingly ashy soil, and many fallen, decomposing portions of the forest. The trail ends abruptly at a large scar scorched through the forest. The piles of ash still present below your feet almost resemble the rest of the planet's otherwise snowy ground, but somehow are kept from mixing with the snow. Whether deliberately cleared by more workers or some other force, you cannot tell. Near the center of the scar you see a small mound with an opening in the side, almost like a "shack" made out of the charred tree trunks and rocks. A faint light comes from within it.`
			`	While you're looking at the mound, Vellorae grabs your hand and starts hesitantly pulling you towards it. Inside, the fading sunlight behind you contrasts with the source of the light within, a small pyre in the middle of the "shack" which has only a few lone flames dancing on the embers. Vellorae lays down in front of it, removes her bangle, and places it in the flames for a brief moment before snatching it up and standing again. Once on her feet, she grabs your hand again, tugging you along as she hurries back to the edge of the scorched clearing.`

				`	"What was that about? What got you so agitated?"`

But finished, It was not, so to implore Adfices is kept safe from It, this was."`
