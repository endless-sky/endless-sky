Stealing Heliarch equipment, promoting rebellious propaganda, attacking Heliarch officials and sites, disrupting our peace with bombings and attacks, intensified all their activities as of late, they have."`

			`You arrive to a thunderstorm, as is often the norm for <planet>, and the agents go over their plans on how to best investigate the planet.`
			`	Tugroob suggests that he pose as an Arach writer looking to find housing on the planet and scurries off to what must be a real estate office. Iplora continues with the original idea of pretending to be a tourist, saying that she will ask the young local Arachi about rumors while walking around the city, hoping to find something of use.`
			`	The two of them leave, and you are left with Kirrie, who has been mostly silent as his friends left your ship.`
			choice
				`	"Are you not going to follow their lead?"`
				`	"Have you not decided how to investigate the planet?"`
			`	"Captain <last>. An edge, your human approach to these missions would give us, the consul said. Except underused, your foreign ideas are, if only the order at which we land on these planets, they are used for."`
			`	He looks out to the rainy spaceport through your hatch, still open from his friends' exits. "Lead the way, would you? The warehouses, I wish to inspect, but your assistance I could use."`
			choice
				`	"Of course, I'll get my rain coat."`
				`	"I'd rather not go out there with that rain."`
					goto decline
			`	You walk in a straight line for about an hour, occasionally being hit by splintering rain drops despite the cover provided by buildings and local structures. Kirrie takes you to the very edge of the town where you would be able to see the hills and mountains in the distance, were it not for the colossal rain clouds and constant downpour. One or two warehouses have a fair bit of rust on their doors, and just once you spot one with a damaged roof. You can also make out the shapes of small trees and bushes not too far out.`
			`	"Now, Captain, start looking for something suspicious, where would you?"`

			`	Kirrie approaches the door, and it opens without him so much as touching it. Unfortunately the warehouse turns out to contain nothing of any significance. It's storage for what Kirrie says are toy parts: just mountains of plastic stacked together. You check a few more warehouses like this, but none turn out to have anything. The rain is starting to get heavier.`
			choice
				`	(Check the warehouse with the leaky roof now.)`
					goto reactor
				`	(Go further out and check the trees and bushes.)`
					goto trees2
				`	(Leave the rest of this to Kirrie.)`
			`	You apologize and tell Kirrie that you don't know what to do next. While he does agree to do it himself, he never stops asking for your opinion on his choices.`
			`	You spend a few more hours looking around until the rain and the wind get too dangerous for you to be moving from warehouse to warehouse. You both take shelter in one of them until the weather settles. Once it does, it is nearly nightfall, and Kirrie is notified by Iplora that she and Tugroob are already back at the ship. You two decide to head back as well.`
			`	It seems Tugroob found some evidence of some smuggled weapons passing through here, but nothing major. Exhausted, the Heliarchs get back in their bunks, asking you to depart the planet.`

			`	Kirrie approaches the door and waits for a few seconds, as if expecting it to open. When it doesn't, he picks his headpiece off and fiddles with it briefly. He puts it on again and waits some more, again to no avail. "To all of these warehouses I should have access. Damaged, the door's electronics don't seem to be," he comments. He then asks you for help, looking for any manner of tools nearby so that you can force the door, while he tries to tinker with the lock. You find something akin to a crowbar, or perhaps a shovel, and bring it to him, and with some effort you two manage to angle it and pull it to pop the door open.`
			`	At first glance there is nothing inside, but after he thoroughly crawls all over the place, he puts his head to a large metal panel on the opposite end of the room. You approach him, and again you two use the tool to bust the lock open, finding a hidden staircase leading underground.`
			`	On your way down, Kirrie yells for you to take cover, and you barely escape a barrage of shots as you head back up. Kirrie isn't as lucky, as a shot hit one of his back legs just before he gets to the stairs. You go to help him up before any more shots come, but he seems to make do with five good legs well enough.`
			`	You two rush back up. Kirrie tells you to be alert and watch the staircase, as he reaches for a small radio-like device to call for support. A few minutes later, a pair of Heliarch Punishers land nearby. Dozens of armed agents enter the warehouse, while you head to one of the ships with Kirrie and wait as his wound is treated.`
			`	The agents return hours later, reporting they shot down the turrets and found the place deserted. "Many automated production lines, we found," one of them tells Kirrie. "Powering them, one of our Reactor Modules is."`
			`	Once the local Heliarchs have the situation under control, they have a Breacher come in to pick you two up. It drops you and Kirrie closer to the <ship>, where you find Iplora and Tugroob already waiting. Kirrie suggests you depart once you all head inside, as his colleagues follow him to his bunk to hear what happened.`

You find some other suspicious sets of bushes, but none have anything underneath. The rain and wind become too intense to stay outside, so you head inside a warehouse and take shelter there.`
			`	Once the weather settles near nightfall, Iplora notifies him that she and Tugroob are already back at the ship, so you two decide to return as well.`

			`	Though you can barely hear each other in the rain, Kirrie insists on staying there and digging through the ground for a while to see if he can find anything.`
			`	You walk back to the empty streets, taking care to not slip on the damp soil. You enter one of the warehouses Kirrie had previously opened and are soon joined by him. He informs you that he dug out the suspicious bushes but couldn't find anything under them.`

They return right at sunset, telling you they found nothing worthwhile. "As expected," Kirrie comments with a sigh. They tell you they're ready to leave, and head to their bunks.`

			`	You come to the remains of a gargantuan mining operation, an enormous hole torn into the planet's crust, spiralling down to what must be nearly a kilometer below the otherwise relatively untouched surface. Near the edge, you spot a medium-sized building, made up of a few interconnected blocks and dirtied up by the planet's sand. Tugroob tells you it must have been the base for the mine workers and managing team when the mine was active.`
			`	Close to the building, farther out from the digging hole, you see a few landing pads of large enough size for even the bulkiest of freighters, likely once used by spacecraft that would ship the raw ore off to smelting facilities. You land on one of them, and you and Tugroob leave your ship. As you step off the landing pad, Tugroob calls your attention to a desert storm brewing in the distance, and says you two should get started before it reaches here.`

			`	The place is surprisingly tidy, if dusty near the door with what sand has been let in. Despite the relative cleanliness, it's evident that the previous owners didn't bother cleaning out before packing up and leaving. Various cabinets, archives and work stations dominate the initial room, and you can see it connects to a collective bedroom, filled with bunks and a storage area.`
			`	"No other entrances there seem to be. If hiding anything here, others were, force their way in they had to, just like us," Tugroob says.`

					goto hole2
				`	"There might be something hidden here. Let's look around."`
			`	You two go about checking every drawer, archive and boxes of all sizes in the first room, but only end up finding a few scattered documents related to the mine, and some old doodles made by what must have been very bored workers. Tugroob tries to get the computers on, but no manner of tinkering brings any electricity to them. The building really is completely out of power.`

			`	You head to the dormitories while Tugroob quickly works his way through what remains in the storage. You check under and over all the beds, looking for anything that might be out of the ordinary, but find nothing. The bedroom leads to two larger modules of the building: one for the restrooms, and the other for a dining area, but after searching these areas you again emerge empty-handed.`

			`	You two begin your descent down the mine, but with a step outside it's clear the storm's caught up to you. You still attempt to move to the hole, but the raging sand makes it too difficult to even find a way to start heading down safely. You two head back inside to wait for better visibility.`
				goto fail

			`	You two approach the hole, and finding one of the many ramps leading down the spiral, carefully make your way down. You pass by some large mining vehicles, akin to very large trucks with thick tracks instead of wheels, and many bores and drills at the front. Tugroob explains they are used to open up tunnels that extend outwards from the main dig hole, to reach lesser mineral deposits without needing to excavate needlessly.`
			`	Continuing on your way down, he points to some of the holes made by the machines, and to many more vehicles near the bottom.`
			choice
				`	(Keep going down.)`
				`	(Investigate the nearby vehicles and tunnels.)`
					goto tunnel
			`	You two speed up as you continue plunging down the mine, and as you're about a quarter of the way down you can see the bottom more clearly. Over the years, it seems the local storms have been filling it up with sand, and with the operation inactive, nobody's bothered clearing it out. The sand's not enough to have reached the larger mining machines, but you suspect even they'll be covered completely in the coming years.`
			`	Tugroob stops you at one point, taking your attention to the top of the hole. The clear sky is growing darker, and you can see the wind picking up and launching some smaller rocks down. "Much time we have not, Captain. Search we cannot amidst a sandstorm, and reach in time the bottom we will not."`
			choice
				`	(Try and investigate the vehicles and tunnels to the sides instead.)`
					goto tunnel
				`	(Head back up and investigate the building.)`
			`	You two rush back up. Tugroob helps you save some time by climbing one of the walls straight up as you cling to him, rather than following the spiraling ramps. You reach the building a few minutes before the storm engulfs it and covers the dig hole completely. As it has no power, Tugroob has to force the door open, gripping to the walls and pulling hard with his front legs until it slides open.`

			`	Given the storm's trapped you in, you two turn over every drawer, archive and box, look over everything in the storage area, try and get the computers to work, and even check the bedroom and its connecting dining area and restrooms, all to no avail. Your search doesn't bear fruit, and so you're left waiting inside as the storm rages around the building.`

			`	As Tugroob is more familiar with the vehicles than you are, he checks them before joining you in exploring the tunnels dug into the sides of the mining hole. The holes mostly head in straight lines down, forming straightforward paths to where the lesser ore veins were.`
			`	The sand continues to pile up into the mine hole when you two come to a vehicle that wasn't driven back fully, and is still blocking the entrance to its tunnel. Tugroob climbs up to see if there's any way to crawl inside, but he is surprised upon checking the driving controls: it's still operational. He drives it back, opening up the hole, and you two go in.`
			`	Lighting the way ahead with your flashlight, you're surprised to see this tunnel is dug slightly upwards, and brings you not to a large, dug out ore vein spot, but to a rustic mineshaft. A few lights on the walls flicker on as you approach them, lighting up the wooden beams supporting the long hallway. Before you go further inside, you're stopped by Tugroob, who crawls around the floor, walls and ceiling just before the first lamp, looping several times without ever going further in. He only stops to slowly reach one leg inside, then right back out after apparently touching something.`
			`	"Request support equipment to get through safely, we must," he says, and using a communication device, he calls for assistance from Heliarch agents, warning them about the sandstorm. You head back up to the building to wait for them.`
			`	Shortly after, several dozen Heliarch agents arrive. Most of them work to keep the sand out, while a few follow you two down and inside the peculiar tunnel, bringing some form of cutting tool and several pieces of sensor equipment. After checking with the sensors for a few minutes, they use the tool to surgically remove what Tugroob was slowly examining before: several extremely thin wires, connected to some type of machinery hidden within the wooden beams.`
			`	After they're done, the agents storm the place but find nobody. What they do find are dozens upon dozens of crates filled to the brim with Heliarch staves, blaster guns, riot gear, and other weaponry.`
			`	They escort you and Tugroob back outside as the agents prepare to bring the smuggled weapons to their own ships. Though the storm is still raging on, you can make out the shape of a few Heliarch Interdictors parked near your own ship right before you take off. You regroup with Iplora and Kirrie, and they ask Tugroob for more details on the ordeal before they head to their own bunks.`

			`	You two exit the building and approach the hole, find one of the many ramps leading down the spiral, and carefully make your way down. You pass by some large mining vehicles, akin to very large trucks with thick tracks instead of wheels, and many bores and drills at the front. Tugroob explains they are used to open up tunnels that extend outwards from the main dig hole, to reach lesser mineral deposits without needing to excavate needlessly.`
			`	Continuing on your way down, he points to some of the holes made by the machines, and to many more vehicles deep down near the bottom.`

			`	You two speed up as you continue plunging down the mine, and as you're about a quarter of the way down you can see the bottom clearer. Over the years, it seems the local storms have been filling it up with sand, and with the operation inactive, nobody's bothered clearing it out. The sand's not enough to have reached the larger mining machines, but you suspect even they'll be covered completely in the coming years.`
			`	Tugroob stops you at one point, taking your attention to the top of the hole. The clear sky has grown much darker, with the storm clouds covering most of it, and you can see the wind's picked up and is launching many smaller rocks down. All the while more and more sand seeps into the hole. "Leave we must, Captain. Search we cannot amidst a sandstorm, and reach in time the bottom we will not."`
			`	To save time and avoid the long spiraling ramps, you cling to Tugroob as he cuts his way up the hole, climbing its walls while carefully avoiding the rocks and falling sand. You barely reach the building before the storm fully engulfs the mine, and decide to wait there. While you wait, you and Tugroob search around more but ultimately find nothing.`
			label fail
			`	Night falls with no sign of the storm dying down, and after receiving a notification from Iplora, Tugroob informs you that you should both head back to the ship and pick her and Kirrie up. As soon as the storm lets up slightly, he helps you out of the building and through the raging winds, until you reach your ship. You two meet up with the rest of the group, and the agents head to their bunks.`

You find her carrying a bag with some equipment and wearing what is - at least when compared to what her colleagues were wearing - fairly light clothing. Although she is a Saryd, you still worry that she might be frostbitten in this extreme weather, but she reassures you that she will be fine.`

You head to your room and prepare yourself for what's to come with the warmest, best clothing you could find for the snowy grounds. When you're done, you head back to your controls to open the hatch, and the both of you head out into the white fields. Not long after leaving your ship, you can make out small, dark lines nearby. It seems you landed close to a forest. Unfortunately, the trees don't do much to protect you from the increasingly dense snowfall.`
			`	You continue deeper into the lifeless forest for what feels like hours, so long that your feet start feeling slightly numb from the cold. After yet another turn amidst identical trees, Iplora guides you out of the forest to a snowy plain, dotted with a few dozen small, sturdy houses. Iplora explains it was something of a resort, popular with Kimek families when the planet wasn't as cold as nowadays. The storm is not so terrible here, so you can also faintly see cave entrances in a few small mounds at the edges of the resort grounds. Snow-covered boulders litter the entire plain, and Iplora warns you to take care not to trip on them.`

As she starts making her way uphill, you head to the closest house and blast the lock after a few failed attempts at opening it normally. You crouch past the entrance of the abandoned home, clearly not intended for any non-Kimek, and begin searching the interior. The furniture is still in surprisingly good shape, if a bit dusty, but you find nothing inside any of the containers, below any of the beds, or hidden under the flooring.`
			`	You move on to the next house, and speed up the process as you go along and get used to the standard layout of the resort homes. After you're done with the fifth one, you leave to find the snowfall growing stronger. It might be best to try and look for Iplora and see if she's found anything, before the blizzard sets in fully.`

Aside from some small campsites, she didn't either. You wait inside a bit more, and when the weather clears and night approaches, you follow her back to the ship.`

Although the scenery is a great sight, the task quickly becomes dull. Even after walking around the entire resort, your efforts produce no results. The snow starts falling much faster, so you begin making your way back to the caverns.`

			`	You search through the boxes as she examines the room looking for some other hidden area, but neither of you find anything. She checks the campfire and concludes that nobody has been here for a few months. You continue exploring the cave and eventually loop back outside, leaving via another cave entrance that, according to Iplora, is this time much further from the forest. Given the blizzard is now strong enough that you've lost sight of the forest from earlier, you wonder how she's even managing to tell where you are, and for how much longer she'll be able to do so.`

She tries to pull you away, but you hit a hard surface yet again, this time creating a faint metallic echo. She takes her hands off of you and lays down, now helping you dig out whatever is there. Once the object is visible, she stands up. Though much of it is still buried, you can tell it's a very large metal container of sorts - the part that's out of the snow looks almost like the larger end of a coffin.`
			`	After clearing out what snow you could from over the rest of the object, you see it's many times larger than either of you. You try to look for some way to open it while she starts going over her bag, looking for something, but the cold, frost-plagued metal doesn't budge to your efforts. She finally seems to find what she was looking for - some sort of comms device - but before she has a chance to activate it, an energy blast from the far side of the resort rattles the ground nearby. It misses her by only a meter or so, and melts much of the snow it hit to nothing.`

They pull them out with equipment they've brought in the ships and carefully melt down the ice and snow layers covering them, finally managing to force their lids open once they've dried out.`

As they open them up and reveal dozens of the torpedoes, Iplora heads out with a group of agents so that she can show them signs of the shootout with the attacker. She gives her thoughts on where they could be fleeing to, and informs another group on the layout of the local caverns before they head underground. When she's back with you, one of the captains of the Neutralizers tell you that they will handle everything from here, and has one of the ships take you two to where your own ship is parked. He leaves as you prepare to take off.`
			`	You head back to pick up Kirrie and Tugroob, who are excited to hear about what happened. They themselves didn't find anything, but they're content with listening to Iplora as she tells the story.`

The inner halls of the <origin> are unlike those of any other Heliarch facility you've been to, with messy arrays of large canisters, equipment boxes, and some form of isolating texture plastered all over the walls, floor and ceiling. Most notable of all, though, is the sheer number of guards stationed here, which, if the few halls you've passed are anything to go by, might well outnumber the civilians present in the ring. "Wait here, please," the Heliarchs escorting you tell you, opening a door to something akin to a conference room. They offer you a seat on one end of a long table.`
			`	Some ten minutes pass before anyone comes in, but after that many Heliarch members start filling up the room, taking their own seats at the table. When the door opens for the last of them to come in, the guard announces "Consul Aulori," to which all the Helliarchs stand up and salute, the noise of conversation giving room to hooves hitting the ground. He is an old Saryd, with gray eyes, pale hair, and a short, well-kept beard. He wears a peculiar necklace with four large gemstones hanging from it. He sits opposite to you, the other Heliarchs sitting back down when he does.`
			`	"Forgive me for the delay you must, colleagues," he says to the other Heliarchs. "Caught up in my evening prayers, I was."

Reading the room, you carefully repeat the information, taking care to not come off as impolite again.`

Then, decide on whether or not to drop the symbol you seem so eager to disrespect into this system's sun, I will," he says, gesturing to your head and the Heliarch circlet you bear. You carefully repeat the information, taking care to not come off as impolite again.`
			label how
			`	He leans forward lightly, staring at you. Looking around the table, the other Heliarchs are engaged in a what appears to be a quiet, heated discussion, gesticulating and occasionally tilting the table with their body weight amidst whispers.`
			`	"How?" Aulori asks, eyes still locked on you. You explain as best as you can about where Deneb is, and what you saw on the other side of the wormhole. When you get to explaining how the system was discovered, the Heliarchs seem to collectively gasp when you first utter the word "Pug." You pause, and many go back to the quiet, whispering discussions, some laughing it off, and others staying silent.`
			`	One Saryd moves as if getting up, but sits back down once Aulori stands, firmly pushing one hand against the table. Conversation around the table dies out, as he stares you down for a long minute. "Leave us for a moment, would you?" he finally says, having some guards bring you outside the room.`
			`	The whispering discussion from earlier now becomes a much louder debate, though the door muffles it all enough that no translator outside the room manages to pick up what is being said. After half an hour, most voices are cut as someone rapidly hits the table, roughly, yelling something in what you think is the Saryd language.`
			`	It all grows quiet for a while, and then the door opens again. Some of the other Heliarchs leave in a haste, and you're asked to head inside again. Consul Aulori is standing up still, giving you a nod as you come in.`
			`	"Adjusted, your ship's sensors will be. Better suited, they will become, for detailed tridimensional projections," he says. He has a pair of Heliarch guards bring you back to your ship, where some engineers go inside your ship and spend some time tinkering with it.

			`	"Skeptical of what you told us, we all were, Captain," Aulori says, gesturing for you to accompany him as he walks around the projection. "Claimed that insane, you were, some of those here did."

You leave your ship, and mention to the nearest Heliarch that you were asked to see Consul Aulori here. They brush you off, saying there has been no such request by the consul. You try and explain that the Heliarch leading the expedition to Ruin mentioned you should come, but they again dismiss you, seemingly unaware of what you're talking about and going on about their business.`
			`	You try a few more times to no avail, and decide to head back to your ship for the time being. It's not until the day is about to turn that a pair of Heliarch guards come to your ship, asking that you step outside. You comply, and they tell you to follow, "for ready to see you, the consul is."`
			`	Once again you're led through the inscrutable, guard-crowded halls of the <planet>, being brought to a long corridor with dozens of closed doors. The one at the very end is apparently your goal.

They apologize to you, saying Aulori might be busy for some time more. You are brought to just outside the room, so that you're received as soon as his "meeting" ends.`

Three of them leave, and you're left with the one who fetched you from your ship, a Saryd. Despite the door to Aulori's room being locked, you two can still clearly hear intense shouting from within - not just his, but from many others who you assume to be consuls as well. After a particularly long - and heated - debate segment from what seems to be Aulori's voice, the Heliarch guard waiting with you declares they'll be coming back soon and hastily moves away, turning the corner.`

Only so much time to experiment there was, when a single ship - a warship - the fleet had. Mistake me not, greatly pleased with the preliminary results, I so far have been, but frustrating it is that limited we are by such time and resource constraints." He sighs. "Like I would, for there to be a larger, more substantial expedition to that ring. But stand as it does, seem it does that wait I must for the council's approval, before taking any further action."`
			`	He moves to pick up a small box on the other side of the room, sitting atop a table surrounded by boards with scribbled notes and mock-up schematics. He brings the box to you and opens it, revealing inside a very small piece of something clearly metallic in nature, but with some odd, unknown property to it you can't identify. "One billion."`

			`	"Over the course of the War of Independence, the amount of kilotons of fissile material used in projectiles that bombarded this ring. One billion. For this ring alone. Not a single dent, they left. Not one." He picks up the piece. "One of the smaller shards of the shattered ring that recover, the expedition could." He gazes at it for a few seconds, before putting it back in the box and returning it to the table. "In my position, to learn of the Quarg, learn as a Quarg, I have had to. Think like them, I must, if to attempt to breach the many blockades they have placed to impede others from learning from their technology, I am. Outnumbered by them, we are. Inferior we remain in our technology. If a means to close the gap, I do not find, then perhaps learning what monstrous weapon could break their rings, learning how to create such a weapon, the only hope for deterring a Quarg offensive is."`
			`	Aulori pauses for nearly a minute, looking at the monitors. "It matters not what nonsense other consuls may tell you, Captain. Know this: give up on their rings the Quarg never will. With your help, and the efforts of the expedition, prepared yet for them, we may become."`

Continued to study and deepen our knowledge on the subject, I since then have, and acted against the interest of uncovering the secrets of the Quarg, I not once have. Saved us centuries - if not millennia - of research, this expedition has. Now, look deeper into the findings myself, I must. To further our fight, and so that a fighting chance we may have. Believe, I do, that likewise, much more productive activities you all have, where concerned the well-being and stability of our Coalition is?"`

"Once done analyzing the findings you are, report them at once you must, before the full council on the Ring of Friendship. Decide then, we shall, whether overlooked, these transgressions will be." Aulori agrees, and the call ends.`

			`Magister Lotuora greets you when you return. "Prevailed over one of our Punishers, you have! Perhaps the real threat, you are, not the Quarg," she says, looking at you for a few seconds as if expecting you to laugh. She hands you <payment>, and continues, "Sent a recording of the fight, I was. Learn much from it, I hope we can."`
			`	She thanks you for helping her with the drills, saying it will be a great help in training the cadets at the local academy. She concludes by wishing you safe travels, and then heads to a Heliarch building.`

			`	When you land, you're met with a bit of ceremony. A trio of Heliarch consuls welcomes you, each carrying a gemstone: an emerald for the Saryd, a ruby for the Kimek, and a sapphire for the Arach. They each pass the precious stones to you, starting with the Saryd, then the Kimek, and lastly the Arach. Cameras and photographers surround the scene, kept at bay by lines of Heliarch guards. It seems your joining the ranks has turned into something of an event.`
			`	When the consuls are done, they have you follow them into the restricted sections of the ring, bringing you to a very large, circular room, somewhat like a colosseum or an auditorium, with hundreds of Heliarch consuls seated. There are also many more camera workers and photographers, though all of them are Heliarch members this time. You're instructed to head to the center.`
			`	The consuls who brought you here speak, and once again you're reminded of your "contributions and loyalty" to the Coalition. "Truly special, this ceremony is," the Arach says. "Join our ranks, for the first time, an outsider does. Contributed much and shown devotion to our Coalition, this outsider has."`
			`	"From humanity, <first> <last> has come," the Kimek continues. "Our most recent neighbor, and a group still under the chiding eyes of the Quarg, they are. To reach them all, to free them all, we still cannot, but, our first step in that front, Captain <last>'s coronation is."`
			`	The Saryd approaches you, carrying some type of chest. Opening it, she reveals a golden circlet inside, staying silent and looking at you.`

				`	"Do I put it on myself?"`

			`	"Allow others to crown us, we do not," she says. "Not anymore."`
			choice
				`	(Take the circlet.)`
			label circlet
			`	You pick up the circlet and raise it to your head, the Heliarch consuls all standing up when you do. You bring it down and adjust it so that it fits you well. Once the "crowning" is done, many of the consuls cheer in celebration, which is followed with something akin to a round of applause and more of the speeches from before.`
			`	When it's all over, you're escorted out by some of the guards, but remain in the restricted sections. Here you are now brought to a much smaller room, where a pair of Heliarchs in lab coats are working at some device reminiscent of a hospital's ultrasound machine. One of them asks you for your circlet, attaching it to various cables near the machine's controls. "Configure your circlet we now shall, so that to your will it responds," the other says, gesturing for you to take a seat. He holds a large, helmet-like piece, with a cable at the top connecting to the machine.`
			choice
				`	"To my will? What do you mean?"`
				`	"Is this really necessary?"`
			`	"Mere jewelry pieces or symbols of rank, these are not," the one tinkering with your circlet explains. "Serve they do as links, interfaces between a Heliarch's will and our Coalition's machines and programs. Allow you they will to access some of our restricted ring sections, and serve as keys to our many outfitters, they do."`
			`	They gesture for you to sit and you comply, having the helmet placed over your head. It blocks out your sight completely, and it feels a lot heavier that you had imagined. "Begin now, we shall," you barely hear one of the Heliarchs say, as most of the sound is muffled. Once the process starts, you hear some wave-like humming echo inside your head, and it doesn't take long before you feel as if you're being spun around. Before you get too uncomfortable, the Heliarchs stop the machine and take the helmet off of you. "All done, we are. Here," one says, handing you your circlet back.`
			`	Putting it on again, you don't notice any difference, but they push you to try it out on one of the doors. You get up from your seat, moving to the entrance door, and it opens up when you're a few steps away. You think to close it, and it does. You repeat a few more times, and turn back to the Heliarchs, who seem amused by seeing you play with your new ability. You look now to the helmet, and with a thought it turns around, seemingly spinning around a head it assumes it is attached to. You turn it off, and begin to test the circlet with the lights and computers in the room.`
			`	When you're done, the two Heliarchs explain some more. "As of a lower rank you are, permit you access to everything and everywhere, your circlet will not. Not yet, at least. But, as mentioned, come to some of the restricted sections, you now many. On many of our worlds, find you will Heliarch outfitters, where now available some of our equipment will be. Permit you to take on some jobs we put up for Heliarch agents here in the restricted sections, the circlet also will."`
			`	They commend you for having joined up, and bid you farewell, having the guards now bring you back to your ship. The three Heliarch consuls who greeted you are waiting for you when you arrive, and hand you a small box which you soon realize is a translation device. "One of us you now are, Captain," the Saryd says. "Trust you we do to uphold the Coalition's values and laws."`
			`	The trio congratulates you once again and wishes you safe travels.`
