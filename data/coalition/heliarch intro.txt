			`	Some of the others explain that you will have to visit the following worlds, where suspicious activity has been reported: Shifting Sand, in Saryd space, Into White, Fourth Shadow and Remote Blue, in Kimek space, and Mebla's Portion and Stronghold of Flugbu, in Arach space.`
			`	They wish the four of you good luck, and have you escorted back to the spaceport. The Heliarch trio arrives at your ship a few minutes later, out of uniform and with heavy luggage.

Iplora continues with the original idea of pretending to be a tourist, saying that she will ask the young local Arachi about rumors while walking around the city, hoping to find something of use.`

Kirrie takes you to the very edge of the town where you would be able to see the hills and mountains in the distance, were it not for the colossal rain clouds and constant downpour. One or two warehouses have a fair bit of rust on their doors, and just once you spot one with a damaged roof. You can also make out the shapes of small trees and bushes not too far out.`

			`	You spend a few more hours checking the warehouses until the rain and the wind get too dangerous for you to be moving from warehouse to warehouse, so you take shelter in one of them until the weather settles. Once it does, it is nearly nightfall, and Kirrie is notified by Iplora that she and Tugroob are already back at the ship. You two decide to head back as well.`

			`	Kirrie approaches the door, and waits for a few seconds, as if expecting it to open. When it doesn't, he picks his headpiece off, and fiddles with it briefly. He puts it on again, and waits some more, again to no avail. "To all of these warehouses I should have access. Damaged, the door's electronics don't seem to be," he comments. He decides that he must get in, and grabs a small sidearm, busting the door open with a couple shots.`
			`	At first glance there is nothing inside, but after he furiously crawls all over the place, he puts his head to a large metal panel on the opposite end of the room, before shooting that too. You approach him to find a hidden staircase leading underground.`
			`	On your way down, Kirrie yells for you to take cover, and you barely escape a barrage of shots as you head back up. Kirrie isn't as lucky, as one of the shots hit one of his back legs just before he is back at the stairs. You go to help him up before any more shots come, but he seems to make do with just five good legs well enough.`
			`	You two rush back up. Kirrie tells you to be alert and watch the staircase, as he reaches for a small radio-like device to call for support. A few minutes later, a pair of Heliarch Punishers land nearby. Dozens of armed agents enter the warehouse, while you head to one of the ships with Kirrie and wait as his wound is treated.`
			`	The agents return hours later, reporting they shot down the turrets and found the place deserted. "Many automated production lines, we found," one of them tells Kirrie. "Powering them, one of our Reactor Modules is."`
			`	With the local Heliarchs taking care of the place, they have a Heliarch Breacher come in to pick you two up, and drop you and Kirrie closer to the <ship>, where you find Iplora and Tugroob already waiting.

			`	You fly to the coordinates and come to the remains of a gargantuan mining operation, an enormous hole torn into the planet's crust, spiralling down to what must be nearly a kilometer below the otherwise relatively untouched surface. Near the edge, you spot a medium-sized building, made up of a few interconnected blocks and dirtied up by the planet's sand. Tugroob tells you it must have been the base for the mining workers and managing team when the mine was active.`
			`	Close to the building, farther out from the digging hole, you see a few landing pads of large enough size for even the bulkiest of freighters, likely there for the raw ore to be shipped off via spacecraft to smelting facilities. You land on one of them, and you and Tugroob leave your ship. As you step off the landing pad, Tugroob calls your attention to a desert storm brewing in the distance, and says you two should get started before it reaches here.`

			`	Left alone for years, the base for the mining operation has no power, so Tugroob has to force the door, gripping the walls and pulling hard with his front legs until it slides open.`
			`	The place is surprisingly tidy, if dusty near the door with what sand has been let in. Despite the relative cleanliness, it's evident that the previous owners didn't bother cleaning out before packing up and leaving. Various cabinets, archives and work stations dominate the initial room, and you can see it connects to a collective bedroom, filled with bunks and a storage area.`
			`	"No other entrances there seem to be. If hiding anything here, others were, force their way in they had to, just like us," Tugroob says.`

				`	"Doesn't look like anyone's been in here in a while. Let's check the mining hole."`
					goto hole2
				`	"There might be something hidden here. Let's look around."`
			`	You two go about checking every drawer, archive and boxes of all sizes in the first room, but only end up finding a few scattered documents related to the mine, and some old doodles made by what must have been very bored workers. Tugroob tries to get the computers on, but no manner of tinkering brings any electricity to them. The building really is completely out of power.`

You check under and over all the beds, and look for anything that might be out of the ordinary, but find nothing. The bedroom leads to two larger modules of the building: one for the restrooms, and the other for a dining area, but after searching these areas you again emerge empty-handed.`

			`	You two approach the hole, and finding one of the many ramps leading down the spiral, carefully make your way down. You pass by some large mining vehicles, akin to very large trucks with thick tracks instead of wheels, and many bores and drills at the front. Tugroob explains they are used to open up tunnels that extend outwards from the main dig hole, to reach lesser mineral deposits without needing to excavate needlessly.`
			`	Continuing on your way down, he points to some of the holes made by the machines, and to many more vehicles deep down, near the bottom.`
			choice
				`	(Keep going down.)`
				`	(Investigate the nearby vehicles and tunnels.)`
					goto tunnel
			`	You two speed up as you continue plunging down the mine, and as you're about a quarter of the way down you can see the bottom more clearly. Over the years, it seems the local storms have been filling it up with sand, and with the operation inactive, nobody's bothered clearing it out. The sand's not enough to have reached the larger mining machines, but you suspect even they'll be covered completely in the coming years.`
			`	Tugroob stops you at one point, taking your attention to the top of the hole. The clear sky is growing darker, and you can see the wind picking up and launching some smaller rocks down. "Much time we have not, Captain. Search we cannot amidst a sandstorm, and reach in time the bottom we will not."`

				`	(Head back up and investigate the building.)`
			`	You two rush back up, with Tugroob helping you save some time by climbing one of the walls straight up as you cling to him, rather than following the spiralling ramps. You reach the building a few minutes before the storm engulfs it and covers the dig hole completely. As it has no power, Tugroob has to force the door open, gripping to the walls and pulling hard with his front legs until it slides open.`

			`	Given the storm's trapped you in, you two turn over every drawer, archive and box, look over everything in the storage area, try and get the computers to work, and even check the bedroom and its connecting dining area and restrooms, all to no avail. Your search doesn't bear fruit, and so you're left waiting inside as the storm rages around the building.`

			`	As Tugroob is more familiar with the vehicles than you are, he checks them first before joining you in exploring the tunnels they dug into the sides of the mining hole. The holes mostly head in straight lines down, forming straightforward paths to where the lesser ore veins were.`
			`	The sand continues to pile up into the mine hole when you two come to a vehicle that wasn't driven back fully, and is still blocking the entrance to its tunnel. Tugroob climbs up to see if there's any way to crawl inside, but is more surprised upon checking the driving controls: it's still operational. He drives it back, opening up the hole, and you two go in.`
			`	Lighting the way ahead with your flashlight, you're surprised to see this tunnel is dug slightly upwards, and brings you not to a large, dug out ore vein spot, but to a rustic mineshaft. A few lights on the walls flicker on as you approach them, lighting up the wooden beams supporting the long hallway. Before you go further inside, you're stopped by Tugroob, who crawls around the floor, walls and ceiling just before the first lamp, looping several times without ever going further in. He only stops to slowly reach one leg inside, then right back out after apparently touching something.`
			`	"Request support equipment to get through safely, we must," he says, and using a communication device, he calls for assistance from Heliarch agents, warning them about the sandstorm. You head back up to the building, to wait for them.`
			`	Shortly after, several dozen Heliarch agents arrive. Most of them work to keep the sand out, while a few follow you two down and inside the peculiar tunnel, bringing some form of cutting tool and several pieces of sensor equipment. After checking with the sensors for a few minutes, they use the tool to surgically remove what Tugroob was slowly examining before: several extremely thin wires, connected to some type of machinery hidden within the wooden beams.`
			`	After they're done, the agents storm the place but find nobody. What they do find are dozens upon dozens of crates filled to the brim with Heliarch staves, blaster guns, riot gear and other weaponry.`
			`	They escort you and Tugroob back outside as the agents prepare to bring the smuggled weapons to their own ships. Though the storm is still raging on, you can make out the shape of a few Heliarch Interdictors parked near your own ship right before you take off. You regroup with Iplora and Kirrie, and they ask Tugroob for more details on the ordeal, before they head to their own bunks.`

			`	You two exit the building and approach the hole, find one of the many ramps leading down the spiral, and carefully make your way down. You pass by some large mining vehicles, akin to very large trucks with thick tracks instead of wheels, and many bores and drills at the front. Tugroob explains they are used to open up tunnels that extend outwards from the main dig hole, to reach lesser mineral deposits without needing to excavate needlessly.`

Over the years, it seems the local storms have been filling it up with sand, and with the operation inactive, nobody's bothered clearing it out. The sand's not enough to have reached the larger mining machines, but you suspect even they'll be covered completely in the coming years.`
			`	Tugroob stops you at one point, taking your attention to the top of the hole. The clear sky has grown much darker, with the storm clouds covering most of it, and you can see the wind's picked up and is launching many smaller rocks down. All the while sand seeps more and more into the hole. "Leave we must, Captain. Search we cannot amidst a sandstorm, and reach in time the bottom we will not."`
			`	To save time and avoid the long spiraling ramps, you cling to Tugroob as he cuts his way up the hole, climbing its walls while carefully avoiding the rocks and falling sand. You barely reach the building before the storm fully engulfs the mine, and decide to wait there. While you wait, you and Tugroob search around more but ultimately find nothing.`

			`	After picking up Tugroob from the last factory, they all analyze their findings one last time. They do this by going over each individual factory, mechanically running down a long list of "possible abnormalities" for each, leaving a mark on the side, and briefly writing a description if any such "abnormality" was noted in a factory.`

You head to your room and prepare yourself for what's to come with the warmest, best clothing you could find for the snowy grounds. When you're done, you head back to your controls to open the hatch, and the both of you head out into the white fields. Not long after leaving your ship, you can make out small, dark lines nearby. It seems you landed close to a forest. Unfortunately, the trees don't do much to protect you from the increasingly dense snowfall.`
			`	You continue deeper into the lifeless forest for what feels like hours, so long that your feet start feeling slightly numb from the cold. After yet another turn amidst identical trees, Iplora guides you out of the forest to a snowy plain, dotted with a few dozen small, sturdy houses. Iplora explains it was something of a resort, popular with Kimek families when the planet wasn't as cold as nowadays. The storm is not so terrible here, so you can also faintly see cave entrances in a few small mounds at the edges of the resort grounds. Snow-covered boulders litter the entire plain, and Iplora warns you to take care not to trip on them.`

As she starts making her way uphill, you head to the closest house and blast the lock after a few failed attempts at opening it normally. You crouch past the entrance of the abandoned home, clearly not intended for any non-Kimek, and begin searching the interior. The furniture is still in surprisingly good shape, if a bit dusty, but you find nothing inside any of the containers, below any of the beds, or hidden under the flooring.`
			`	You move on to the next house, and speed up the process as you go along and get used to the standard layout of the resort homes. After you're done with the fifth one, you leave to find the snowfall growing stronger. It might be best to try and look for Iplora and see if she's found anything, before the blizzard sets in fully.`

Although the scenery is a great sight, the task quickly becomes dull. Even after walking around the entire resort, your efforts produce no results. The snow starts falling much faster, so you begin making your way back to the caverns.`

			`	You search through the boxes as she examines the room looking for some other hidden area, but neither of you find anything. She checks the campfire and concludes that nobody has been here for a few months. You continue exploring the cave and eventually loop back outside, leaving via another cave entrance that, according to Iplora, is this time much further from the forest. Given the blizzard is now strong enough that you've lost sight of the forest from earlier, you wonder how she's even managing to tell where you are, and for how much longer she'll be able to do so.`

She tries to pull you away, but you hit a hard surface yet again, this time creating a faint metallic echo. She takes her hands off of you and lays down, now helping you dig out whatever is there. Once the object is visible, she stands up. Though much of it is still buried, you can tell it's a very large metal container of sorts - the part that's out of the snow looks almost like the larger end of a coffin.`
			`	After clearing out what snow you could from over the rest of the object, you see it's many times larger than either of you. You try to look for some way to open it while she starts going over her bag, looking for something, but the cold, frost-plagued metal doesn't budge to your efforts. She finally seems to find what she was looking for, some sort of comms device, but before she has a chance to activate it, an energy blast from the far side of the resort rattles the ground nearby. It misses her by only a meter or so, and melts much of the snow it hit to nothing.`

As they open them up and reveal dozens of the torpedoes, Iplora heads out with a group of agents, showing them signs of the shootout with the attacker, and giving her thoughts on where they could be fleeing to. She also informs another group on the layout of the local caverns before they head underground. When she's back with you, one of the captains of the Neutralizers tell you that they will handle everything from here, and has one of the ships take you two to where your own ship is parked. He leaves as you prepare to take off.`

The inner halls of the <origin> are unlike those of any other Heliarch facility you've been to, with messy arrays of large canisters, equipment boxes, and some form of isolating texture plastered all over the walls, floor and ceiling. Most notable of all, though, is the sheer number of guards stationed here, which, if the few halls you've passed are anything to go by, might well outnumber the civilians present in the ring. "Wait here, please," the Heliarchs escorting you tell you, opening a door to something akin to a conference room. They offer you a seat on one end of a long table.`
			`	Some ten minutes pass before anyone comes in, but after that many Heliarch members start filling up the room, taking their own seats at the table. When the door opens for the last of them to come in, the guard announces "Consul Aulori," to which all the Helliarchs stand up and salute, the noise of conversation giving room to hooves hitting the ground. He is an old Saryd of gray eyes, pale hairs, with a short, well-kept beard, wearing a peculiar necklace with four large gemstones hanging from it. He sits opposite to you, the other Heliarchs sitting back down when he does.`
			`	"Forgive me for the delay you must, colleagues," he says to the other Heliarchs. "Caught up in my evening prayers, I was." He examines the room for a while, briefly glancing at each of the Heliarchs, until his eyes settle on yours. "Told, I was, that some valuable information for us, you have, Captain <last>."`

				`	"I know of a system where a broken Quarg ringworld is. I figured I should tell you."`
				`	"Would I be paid if I told you about a place where you can find a broken Quarg ringworld?"`

They come in and position themselves to your sides, and behind you. "Afraid I am that once again, failed to understand it I have, <first> <last>. Now, one final time, repeat it, would you?" Reading the room, you carefully repeat the information, taking care to not come off as impolite again.`

Then, decide on whether or not to drop the symbol you seem so eager to disrespect into this system's sun, I will." He finishes gesturing to your head, and the Heliarch circlet you bear. You carefully repeat the information, taking care to not come off as impolite again.`
			label how
			`	He leans forward lightly, staring at you. Looking around the table, the other Heliarchs are engaged in a what appears to be a quiet, heated discussion, gesticulating and occasionally tilting the table with their body weight amidst whispers.`
			`	"How?" Aulori asks, eyes still locked on you. You explain as best as you can about where Deneb is, and what you saw on the other side of the wormhole. When you get to explaining how the system was discovered, the Heliarchs seem to collectively gasp when you first utter the word "Pug." You pause, and many go back to the quiet, whispering discussions, some laughing it off, and others staying silent.`
			`	One Saryd moves as if getting up, but sits back down once Aulori stands up, firmly pushing one hand against the table. Conversation around the table dies out, as he stares you down for a long minute. "Leave us for a moment, would you?" he finally says, having some guards bring you outside the room.`
			`	The whispering discussion from earlier now becomes a much louder debate, though the door muffles it all enough that no translator outside the room manages to pick up what is being said. After half an hour, most voices are cut as someone rapidly hits the table, roughly, yelling something in what you think is the Saryd language.`
			`	It all grows quiet for a while, and then the door opens again. Some of the other Heliarchs leave in a haste, and you're asked to head inside again. Consul Aulori is standing up still, giving you a nod as you come in.`
			`	"Adjusted, your ship's sensors will be. Better suited, they will become, for detailed tridimensional projections," he says. He has a pair of Heliarch guards bring you back to your ship, where some engineers go inside your ship and spend some time tinkering with it. After they're done, one of the Heliarchs that was in the room approaches you, telling you they need you to land on the planet you described, <stopovers>, and to travel to <waypoints> to scan the ringworld.

			`	"Skeptical of what you told us, we all were, Captain," Aulori says, gesturing for you to accompany him as he walks around the projection. "Claimed that insane, you were, some of those here did." He looks down at a Kimek briefly. "Or that wasting our time with jokes, you were." A Saryd steps back as you two continue, making way for the consul. "Assured me, some of them had, that wholly impossible, it was, to break a ring." He stomps down his hooves close to an Arach and stops where the projection shows signs of greater damage.

You try and explain it was the Arach Heliarch who mentioned you should come, but they again dismiss you, seemingly unaware of what you're talking about and going on about their business.`

Despite the door to Aulori's room being locked, you two can still clearly hear intense shouting from within - not just his, but from many others who you assume to be consuls as well.

Only so much time to experiment there is, when a single ship - a warship - the fleet had. Mistake me not, greatly pleased with the preliminary results, I so far have been, but frustrating it is that limited we are by such time and resource constraints." He sighs. "Like I would for a larger, more substantial expedition to that ring. But, as it stands, seem it does that wait I must for the council's approval, before taking any further action."`
			`	He moves to pick up a small box on the other side of the room, sitting atop a table surrounded by boards with scribbled notes and mock-up schematics. He brings the box to you, and opens it, revealing inside a very small piece of what's clearly metallic in nature, but with some odd, unknown property to it you can't identify. "One billion."`

Not one." He picks up the piece. "One of the smaller shards of the shattered ring that recover, the expedition could." He gazes at it for a few seconds, before putting it back in the box, and returning that to the table. "In my position, learn of the Quarg, learn as a Quarg, I have had to. To think like them, I must, if to attempt to breach the many blockades that placed they have to impede others from learning from their technology, I am. Outnumbered by them, we are. Inferior we remain in our technology. If a means to close the gap, I do not find, then perhaps learning what monstrous weapon could break their rings, learning how to create such a weapon, the only hope for deterring a Quarg offensive is."`
			`	Aulori pauses for nearly a minute, looking at the monitors. "It matters not what nonsense other consuls may tell you, Captain. Know this: give up on their rings the Quarg never will. With your help, and the efforts of the expedition, prepared yet for them, we may become."`

They each pass the precious stones to you, starting with the Saryd, then the Kimek, and lastly the Arach. Cameras and photographers surround the scene, kept at bay by lines of Heliarch guards. It seems your joining the ranks has turned into something of an event.`
			`	When the consuls are done, they have you follow them into the restricted sections of the ring, bringing you to a very large, circular room, somewhat like a colosseum or an auditorium, with hundreds of Heliarch consuls seated. There are also many more camera workers and photographers, though all of them are Heliarch members this time. You're instructed to head to the center.`
			`	The consuls who brought you here speak, and once again you're reminded of your "contributions and loyalty" to the Coalition. "Truly special, this ceremony is," the Arach says. "Join our ranks, for the first time, an outsider does. Contributed much and shown devotion to our Coalition, this outsider has."`
			`	"From humanity, <first> <last> has come," the Kimek continues. "Our most recent neighbor, and a group still under the chiding eyes of the Quarg, they are. To reach them all, to free them all, we still cannot, but, our first step in that front, Captain <last>'s coronation is."`

Once the "crowning" is done, many of the consuls cheer in celebration, with something akin to a round of applause, and more of the speeches from before.`
			`	When it's all over, you're escorted out by some of the guards, but remain in the restricted sections. Here you are now brought to a much smaller room, where a pair of Heliarchs in lab coats are working at some device reminiscent of a hospital's ultrasound machine. One of them asks you for your circlet, attaching it to various cables near the machine's controls. "Configure your circlet we now shall, so that to your will it responds," the other says, gesturing for you to take a seat. He holds a large, helmet-like piece, with a cable at the top connecting to the machine.`
			choice
				`	"To my will? What do you mean?"`
				`	"Is this really necessary?"`
			`	"Mere jewelry pieces or symbols of rank these are not," the one tinkering with your circlet explains. "Serve they do as links, interfaces between a Heliarch's will and our Coalition's machines and programs. Allow you they will to access some of our restricted ring sections, and serve as well as keys to our many outfitters, they do."`
			`	They gesture for you to sit, and you comply, having the helmet placed over your head. It blocks out your sight completely, and feels a lot heavier that you had imagined. "Begin now, we shall," you barely hear one of the Heliarchs say, as most of the sound is muffled. Once the process starts, you hear some wave-like humming echo inside your head, and it doesn't take long before you feel as if you're being spun around. Before you get too uncomfortable, the Heliarchs stop the machine, and take the helmet off of you. "All done, we are. Here," they say, handing you your circlet back.`
			`	Putting it on again, you don't notice any difference, but they push you to try it out on one of the doors. You get up from your seat, moving to the entrance door, and it opens up when you're a few steps away. You think to close it, and it does. You repeat a few more times, and turn back to the Heliarchs, who seem amused by seeing you play with your new ability. You look now to the helmet, and with a thought it turns around, seemingly spinning around a head it assumes it is attached to. You turn it off, and begin to test the circlet with the lights and computers in the room.`
			`	When you're done, the two Heliarchs explain some more. "As of a lower rank you are, permit you access to everything and everywhere, your circlet will not. Not yet, at least. But, as mentioned, come to some of the restricted sections, you now many. On many of our worlds, find you will Heliarch outfitters, where now available some of our equipment will be. Permit you to take on some jobs we put up for Heliarch agents here in the restricted sections, the circlet also will."`
			`	They commend you for having joined up, and bid you farewell, having the guards now bring you back to your ship. The three Heliarch consuls who greeted you are waiting for you when you arrive, and hand you a small box which you soon realize is a translation device. "One of us you now are, Captain," the Saryd says. "Trust you we do to uphold the Coalition's values and laws."`
			`	The trio congratulates you once again, and wish you safe travels.`
