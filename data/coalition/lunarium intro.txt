The Kimek keep pushing and tugging at you as they bring you around the city. After many minutes, you hear some doors close behind you, and your captors force you into some cramped room or compartment. You try to stand up straight, but hit your head against the ceiling.

She asks that one of the weapons from the crate be put on the table, and taps it with her leg. "Powerful, the blasts from these are, but in need of some more broad, wider-impacting equipment, we are.

			`The spaceport on <origin> shows fewer of the banners than you expected, with only a few scattered about the walls. One Arach leaves their work building and gasps at the first banner they see, taking it down and throwing it in a bin.

Another Arach has a similar reaction to a different banner, but after pondering for a bit, leaves it alone and walks away.`
			`	When you're done gauging the local reception to Tummug's banners, you go look for him. Eventually you arrive at a workshop, where he's talking with four other Arachi as they work on some small robots not too different from those employed in Arach hull repair systems. The only difference appears to be "wings" that the Arachi are testing by controlling them remotely. "Captain <last>!" Tummug exclaims when he notices you.

"Leave our messages in skywriting, we will," he says as he hands the controller back to the Arachi.

When taken, the Ring of Friendship was, when formed, the Heliarchy was, still far more advanced and experienced in most fields the Saryds were. Turned 'their' ring into the seat of government, they had, and in the naive euphoria victory had granted them, tricked into adopting the Saryd law system, the Kimek and Arachi of the time were. Saryd sentences, Saryd punishments." He looks at you as he drags some legs across the floor, as if scratching the ground. "For only a quarter of a Saryd lifetime, the eldest of the Arachi lived. For all their population, managed to live past a century only a few dozen Kimek have. A third of a lifetime to them, even relatively minor Saryd sentences, the Heliarch sentences, are."

			`	Almost half an hour goes by with you watching the skies of <planet> before the first signs of the drones show: they're too small for you to see from where you are, but you make out the piles of red smoke swiftly growing into Kimek letters in the sky, appearing in spiraling columns and arcs, with small, spread out dots separating the letters. Crowds clog the streets, Kimek look out the windows and some even gather atop apartment buildings to gaze at the messages. When the drones are done, the messages Tummug had shown you on the flyer are fully formed, and the drones take a short break. When they return, they get to work on another set of messages as the first one begins dissipating. After a few repetitions, and another pause, flyers begin raining down the city streets, the local Kimek picking them up in curiosity and discussing among themselves. The "rain" goes on for several minutes, before the drones start heading to other portions of the city and you lose sight of them.`
			`	Focusing now on the crowds and their reception, you see the Kimek are split: nearly everywhere they are in heated discussion, with many on one side seemingly approving of the display, while others yell and gesture for the messages to be put out, throwing the flyers to the ground and stomping on them. The Heliarch agents present on the ground do their best to separate the crowds and keep the order, but struggle against the sheer number of Kimek. Not long after the drones disappeared, however, Heliarch warships fly through the atmosphere in a fury, speedily undoing the skywriting as they head in the direction of the factory. Some ships leave more agents on the ground, and with increased personnel the Heliarchs now manage to stop the crowd infighting, and start clearing out the streets.`

She waits for you to answer, but seeing your puzzled look, resumes her explanation. "The Lunarium Redoubt? Assisted us before, you have, even if aware of all the details beforehand you were not. Suppose I do that mostly heard of us as criminals or the like, you must have. Petty in their propaganda, the Heliarchs are.

One of the highest ranks, that is, second only to the consuls themselves," she responds, getting closer to you. "Change for the better, the Coalition soon will. Difficult it will be, to take down the Heliarchy. Very strong it is, so greatly appreciated any help would be. Of course, once free from them we are, rewarded appropriately shall be those, help us who do in our time of need."`

			`	"Of course, only exposed to Heliarchy propaganda, you are. An achievement of the current Heliarchs, what prosperity we have is not, and furthering that prosperity, they most certainly are not!" She quickly slows down her breathing after the exclamation, calming down. "Grown paranoid, they have. Seen a Quarg in millennia, nobody in the Coalition has, but think they do, that to fight the Quarg their purpose is. Making enemies, taking prisoners of their own people, they have been. Public arrests with no warning or cause, disappearances in the night..." She backs away slightly, her mandibles clicking in a low murmur.

They then ask if there are any major shipyards in the South, and you point them to Southbound Shipyards, on <planet>, and the Tarazed Corporation, on Wayfarer. After some debate, they decide that <planet>'s proximity to the Coalition makes it a better pick in case they need to return quickly, and settle on that as the destination.

Your face showing some confusion, she explains her plans further. "After gotten the gist of fighting human pirates with you, we have, work as bounty hunters, we will.

You ask her to simply type something into your monitor, with the aid of the same translating software, and point to her the jumbled words when it translates to your language. "And always like this, our translators have been?" she asks in disbelief. You nod, and in either some act of shame, or anger, she cowers her legs closer to her body, while tapping the ground with them erratically. "Work perfectly for translating from the human language, they do, and problems between the Coalition languages, there are not... Reported before, this issue was not. Not to the Heliarchs, not to us! An embarrassment, that is..." She sighs, spreading her legs back to normal. "Once in power, we are, talk to Oobat about fixing them, I will. For now, hope I will that need to communicate with humans much, we will not."`

			`	Once all the purchased ships are parked near your own, you give her another rundown, this time of the job board. You help her learn the layout of bounty hunting jobs, and give her some tips on locating ships with bounties on them. Hours after nightfall, you see the hangars become much less lively, with only the night shift workers moving about. You open the hatch and make sure the coast is clear before moving with the Lunarium members to the Bastion, parked closest to your own ship. The members assigned to that ship enter the hatch, Pyakri included, and you repeat the process with the others, heading to the Argosies in front of you. After the last of them, you move in quick trips to each of the Clippers, finally looping back to your ship once you're done. With everyone now in their own ship, you ask some workers to help move the supplies right by the hatches. Once the workers have moved away, the Lunarium crew open up to bring the cargo inside, and you head to the Bastion to meet with Pyakri.`
			`	You find the ship's interior already undergoing modifications, with many of the Arachi using various legs to hold wires in place as they replace the human control pads and keys to versions they are more accustomed to. Pyakri is inside the cockpit, testing many of the controls as she looks at a manual on one screen, already translated to the Kimek language. "Ah, hello again Captain. Worked well, the plan has, and seen we were not. At least hope that, I do." She opens up a map, pointing to a star you recognize as <waypoints>. "Taken our first job, we have. Since far more experienced in fighting human pirates, you are, ask for your help in this first fight, I must. Informed me the job offer has, that in this system the bounties are. Head there quickly to face them, we should, before time to flee, they have. Follow your ship there, we will." You go from ship to ship, reminding each of the captains to be careful in the coming fight, and then enter your own. With the purpose of this training being to grow the Lunarium's combat experience and tactics, things certainly wouldn't work well if some of them died right in their first fight, so you should try and keep them all alive.`

You continue following the two Kimek past busy tables and Kimek patrons who all have eyes on you as you head to the back.`

You arrive at some doors that open to an Arach delegation, with half a dozen bulky Arachi surrounding a young, fine-dressed lady in a blue "dress" with white lines wrapping around it.

Unsure on how to respond, you do your best extravagant bow, which seems to satisfy her as she pulls her leg back closer to her body.

			`	The Kimek who accompanied you here ask that you continue on. Lobmab and her bodyguards lead the way through busy cubicles and hallways, where dozens of Kimek work at computers and screens, as if monitoring the whole city. At the end of what seems to be the main passage of the complex, you pass through a doorway to find the Lunarium leaders seated around a table. You're shown to a seat, and as Lobmab comes in at the end, one of the bodyguards announces, "Lady Lobmab Bebliss, head of our great House."`
			`	Some of the others at the table look to one another, and one of the Kimek who accompanied you all the way from your ship sighs quietly before coming to Lobmab. "Most welcome you are, Lady Lobmab," he says, as he begins pointing to the leaders one by one, starting from your left with a Kimek. "Your host, Chiree is, the head of our local forces and organizer of many of our operations. Fought the Heliarchs since a young age, she has." He continues pointing to them in a clockwise pattern, now to the left of Chiree. "Likewise, been helping us for decades now, Tummug has, in spreading word of our group, and bringing to the people the truth about the Heliarchy. Another prominent Arach, and vital to the task soon to be discussed, Oobat is. A studious linguist, and aspiring diplomat, she is. Already worked together, I believe you and Pyakri have? One of our most senior militia officers, she is." He takes a pause, looking at Lobmab, almost as if waiting for some approval regarding his introductions of the others. She simply nods, and he moves on. "And... Elirom. A prominent Saryd Heliarch Arbiter who defected over a century ago. Been advising us since, he has." He waits for her to say something, before looking back at the table again and pointing to you. "Oh, of course. <first> <last>, the human, helped us greatly who has, and joining us today, who is."`
			`	Satisfied with the introductions, Lobmab takes her seat, much to the Kimek's relief. "Very grateful we are, that made the time for this meeting you have, Lady Lobmab," Chiree says. "A special task for Captain <last>, we have, and wish to have all leaders present to discuss it, we did. But, first, welcome our newest member, we must," she says, looking at you.

			`	"Once back in order, everything is, focus on reassuring the populace we should. A change for the better, it will be, and help in making sure everyone realizes that, House Bebliss will," Lobmab jumps in. "Earn back what they took from us, we will."`
			`	Once the head of House Bebliss is done, Chiree continues. "Pointless, our fight will have been, if corrupted in those rings again, our successors thousands of years from now become. Set up transparency measures and means to ensure that absolute power, the consuls do not have, we will."`

Due to being simpler, easier to produce in what factories we have, they are. Also lack experience, the troops do..."`
			`	The mood around the table quickly dims as she goes on listing the ways the Lunarium is lacking in comparison to your opponents. Elirom stands up, putting both hands on the table to draw attention. "Smarter than us, they are not. Assure you of that, I can. Wanting in many areas we are, yes, but only because hoard our best materials, they do. Already preparing some deadlier weapons, we are. Finished, the blueprints have been. Only lacking the right materials, we are. When secured those, we have, move on to reforming our arsenal we can, and maybe get some better ships produced, too."`
			`	"And suppose I do that, intend to tell me where to attack for such materials, you do?" Pyakri asks as she stands up herself. "Caught by 'the unforeseen' will my men again be? By an Arach battalion you forgot to mention, again?"`
			`	Caught off-guard by the question, apparently, Elirom looks at her for a few seconds, then resigns himself to sit back down.`

Told us they have of Heliarch activity, fleet movements, training drills, propaganda plans. Always exactly right in their predictions, the messages were. Also pointed us to equipment caches - caches with outfits previously found nowhere in the Coalition - they have. Human weaponry, blueprints, factory parts..."`
			`	"Aware of the identity of whoever does it, we are not," Elirom says. "An arbiter I was, and though a great deal I knew, still kept from me, some critical information was. Possible, it is, that from one of the consuls, the information comes. Though, difficult to steal a jump drive to bring in the weapons, it would be, even for a consul." He pauses, a dead stare in his eyes as he bites lightly on a finger. "Also received word of... experiments, we have from the messages. Some manner of procedure to take over bodies... stop whatever it is being done in the rings, we must."`
				goto questions

			`	The rest of the table look to Lobmab at the same time, prompting her explanation. "Amassed great fortune over our history, House Bebliss has. As part of our gracious help to the Lunarium, providing nearly everything in financial terms we have been."`
			`	She stops, with the others still looking at her, as if expecting something more. She remains silent, so Chiree looks back at you, continuing, "Also taken some loans from House Plumtab in our stead, Houses Bebliss and Idriss have. Not terribly passionate for our cause, Plumtab's bankers are, but share our interest in booting the Heliarchs, they do, even if meet or talk with us, they never do."`

			`	Tummug goes around the table, handing copies of some documents to the other leaders before answering. "One of the centerpoints of Heliarch propaganda, the fear of the Quarg is. Served to justify their budget, and their obsession with hoarding the military, for millennia it has. Thought up a way to mitigate the effect that has on the populace, Oobat has."`
			`	With this cue, Oobat goes further into the plan. "Not seen in Coalition space in over six thousand years, a Quarg ship has been. Most likely moved on from our war, they have, unlike the Heliarchs. If proof of the Quarg's lack of interest in waging war against us, we had, spread it to the people, we could. Given the Captain's resourcefulness, and possession of a jump drive, think we did that the best way to acquire that proof, meeting up with the Quarg is." She grabs one of the documents, pointing to it. "For you all to review these questions, I would like. Careful we should be, with regard to their wording. Once done, we are, board Captain <last>'s ship, I will. Meet with the Quarg in human space, we must," she says the last part looking at you. "Met with the Quarg before, have you, Captain?"`

			`	The Lunarium leaders spend an hour or so going over the questions proposed for the interview, deciding to ditch some, and add a few new ones. All the while, Elirom asks in a worried manner if Oobat is sure of this idea. "Forgive me if sounding like a Heliarch, I am, but dangerous to leave, it is. Know we do not, the Quarg reaction to seeing someone from the Coalition in their territory."`
			`	"Understand that, I do, but fine I will be. Unlike the Quarg it is, to attack unprovoked," she answers. "And if bad comes to worst, trust I do in Captain <last>'s abilities to ensure our escape." The leaders go over the interview questions a while longer, until they've reached a consensus as to its completeness. They wish you and Oobat good luck, and you both are escorted back out of the complex to your ship. There, Oobat asks you for the best place for such an interview in human space, and you point to <destination>, where the Quarg are constructing their ringworld. "Then head there, we must. In your care I will be, Captain." You show her to her bunk, and plot a course to <planet>.`

			`Once you've docked in <origin>, you go check on Oobat, who's readying some form of camera while rehearsing the questions for the interview. "Just a moment Captain, ready in a minute I will be," she says. You head out of your ship and flag down the first Quarg you see.`
			`	"How may I assist you, human?" it says.`
			choice
				`	"I've brought an Arach from the Coalition. She wants to interview the Quarg."`
				`	"I'm with a group from the Coalition, the Lunarium, who are fighting the Heliarchs. They want to talk to you, and have sent a diplomat with me."`
			`	It stays silent, glancing over at your ship. "I see," it says. "Wait here. I will bring one who can speak on the matter." It moves away in a quickstep, briefly talking to some other Quarg along the way, who come to your ship and wait. Oobat comes out of your ship as you wait, causing a minor scene as some of the humans visiting the station panic at the sight of a giant spider. Others come closer, intrigued by the unknown alien, or perhaps thinking her to be some form of prop. Oobat doesn't pay them much mind though, instead focusing on the Quarg near the two of you, and watching the others in the distance.`
			`	The Quarg around you dissuade the gawking humans from getting closer, and after a few more minutes a Quarg in faded, light gray robes comes to meet you. "Hello, human. And..."`
			`	"Oobat, my name is," she says. "A member of the Lunarium Redoubt, a group in the Coalition created to fight the Heliarchs, I am. Assisted us much, Captain <last> has, and bring me here now they did, for wish to ask you some questions about your views on the Coalition, my group does."`
			`	The Quarg gazes at you two for a few seconds, before squatting down to your level. "Very well. What questions do you have?"`
			`	She hands you the camera, turning it on and asking that you keep it as still as you can once you're positioned to get a good angle. She then connects her translator to it remotely, so that the audio picks up the Quarg's translated responses. "Well, begin then we shall. Regarding the very reason for the Coalition's formation, intending to fight us again, are you?"`
			`	It thinks for a moment, then answers, "No. We never intended to fight. It was the Saryds, Kimek and Arachi of old who fought us. We are not a warring people."`
			`	Seemingly satisfied with the answer, Oobat moves on to the next. She questions the Quarg for about ten minutes on their activities outside the Coalition and their relation with the humans and other species. She even has you move the camera around for a bit to show the local human-Quarg interactions, as the Quarg compares dealing with humanity to dealing with the Coalition species. Oobat moves from question from question as if in a checklist, until she arrives at the last one. "About finished, we are. Thankful for your answers I am. Just one last thing, to appease the people back home. Interested in returning to take back the rings, are you?"`
			`	"Of course," it says without hesitation. "The rings are our homes. My home." Clearly not expecting that answer, Oobat looks at you in confusion.`
			choice
				`	"It's been thousands of years. You're still lingering on those rings?"`
				`	"If you want them back, why haven't you returned by now?"`
					goto why
			`	"Lingering on... 'those' rings? Our rings. Our homes," it replies. "Do you so easily forget yours?" The Quarg crosses one arm, grabbing its shoulder, lowering its head as its back curves. Patches of skin start turning pitch black, and it brings its other arm to its head as if in pain.`
				goto accept
			label why
			`	"Because that would have forced a fight. The three... these Heliarchs, would not listen. They never listened," it answers, crossing one arm and grabbing its shoulder, lowering its head as its back curves. Patches of skin start turning pitch black, and it brings its other arm to its head as if in pain.`
			label accept
			`	By now the atmosphere's changed, with no humans in sight around you. Dozens more Quarg begin to form circles around your ship, eyes fixated on Oobat. The ones closest to you watch the one who was being interviewed carefully, like waiting for some sign, as its whole body shifts color. Oobat is still looking at you, confusion and worry written on her face.`
			choice
				`	"I think that does it for the interview."`
				`	"We should leave. Now."`
			`	She nods, and gives a quick "thank you" to the Quarg again, turning to go back inside your ship. The Quarg stops her though, reaching out one arm quickly to grab one of her legs. Slowly, its skin turns back to the grayish blue from before, as it calms down. "Should you succeed, please, permit my return home." The Quarg around you disperse, and the one who was interviewed stands up again and moves back to other sections of the station.`
			`	You board your ship with Oobat, and hand her back the camera. "Mostly well, it went," she says, looking through the sped up footage and pausing at certain moments where the Quarg is responding. "Not what we expected from that last question, it was, however. Disappointed, I imagine Elirom will be." She tells you she'll be working on some basic edits to the footage, and says you may return to <planet>.`

			`When you and Oobat reach the Lunarium's complex, you're welcomed back by Chiree, Elirom and Tummug. "Tell you I did that come back safely, they would," Tummug says to Elirom. "So, good enough to use in our efforts, was it?"`
			`	Oobat shows them the recording, satisfaction clear on their faces as they listen to the Quarg. The mood darkens when the last question appears, however. Once it ends, Elirom stands up and heads to the nearest wall, slamming an arm onto it. Chiree sighs, and turns to Tummug, "Worth using still, is the footage?"`
			`	"Up until that one? Yes, of course. Need to edit it for a cleaner, quicker video, we do, but a great piece it will be," he says. "That last part though, go as we expected, it did not."`
			`	"Only prove the Heliarchs right, that last question would," Elirom chimes in. "Matter not, it does, if a thousand times the footage disproves their narrative. If even one thing, pick and spin as proof of their side they can, fruitless, the effort will be." He pauses, then hits the wall again, with less force. "Play it again, could you?" Oobat obliges, and plays the recording once again. Elirom has it paused a few times over the course of the video, breaking out a device to write down some notes. Once he's finished, he has the last portion repeated a few times still, seeming particularly interested in the Quarg's changing pigment. "Onyx black..." he ponders out loud, "what was, again, the emotion of that color?" Snapping out of the trance only after a few more repetitions, he hands Oobat the notes. "Right they were about the Quarg wanting to take the rings back... A shame it is, that use that point against them we cannot. Though, maybe, if interested in the rings they still are after so long..."`
			`	He exits without saying anything else, leaving everyone else confused with his abrupt departure. "Much to take in at once, it must be, for him in particular. A Heliarch he once was, after all," Tummug says. "Get to work on perfecting the footage, and readying it for release to the public, we should."`
			`	Oobat agrees, and the two prepare to leave with the footage. "A unique experience the trip was, Captain. Hope I do that work together again, we soon will."`
			choice
				`	"Same here. It was different from my usual jobs, working a camera and all."`
				`	"Anytime. Just, let's find some more normal people to interview, next time."`
			`	She chuckles, and nods before leaving the room, following Tummug out of the Lunarium complex.`

			`	Chiree approaches you and hands you a small box. You pick it up, and upon cursory examination, notice it's one of the Coalition's translation devices. "One of us you now are, so capable of understanding what we say without others aiding you, you should be," she says. "Still readying ourselves for major assaults on the Heliarchs, we are. A difficult fight against them, we will have, all the way. Hoping, I am, that with your help we can count, when the time comes."`
				goto end
			label heliarch
			`	You look to Chiree, and see her brushing her frontmost left leg with the tip of her right one, as if cleaning away something. Once she's done, you see various bolts and a metal texture revealed. "Lose two of my legs to a Heliarch attack, I did. Grown used to the prosthetics, I have, but faded from my memory, that day has not." She stares at you. "Aware, we are, that helped the Heliarchs before, you have. Ask about specifics, I did not, for wish to know, I do not. Harmless work, it may have been. Or, helped them mutilate others like me, you may have." She approaches you, handing you a small box: one of the Coalition's translation devices. "One of us, you now are. Hear of any more aid to the Heliarchs from your side, I will not."`
			label end
			`	You say your goodbyes, and you're escorted out of the complex and back to your ship. The Kimek who brought you there enter the ship with you briefly, and inform you that they've sent word across their major bases in the Coalition about your joining up. You're told that you'll find some new outfits available in their secretive outfitters. "In separate portions of the cities, sometimes in other cities entirely, our shops are, but safe from Heliarch patrols, they so far have proven." They give you a short list of the planets where you'll find their outfitters, and coordinates and instructions as to how to get to and access each of them.`
			`	When they leave, you start tinkering with the translation device, figuring out how to configure it to translate each of the languages. After testing it using local transmissions and broadcasts for half an hour or so, you're decently fast with it, to the point where you can change what language it translates to or from a few times in a second.`
			`	It may be a long time still before the Lunarium is ready to take up arms against the Heliarchs, so for now you figure you could help by looking into what minor jobs they may have for you.`
