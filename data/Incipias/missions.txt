"Well", he says, "I hope it is not only this box. It does not seem made by humans, but I fear this wont be enough for a prove. "Of course not", you say and open the box towards the Hai. Suddenly he freezes and just stares at the small gem inside of it. "Indeed, that is nothing made by humans and no Hai could create this either. This must be the work of a really advanced species.

"Of course," You say, "This is the prove you asked me to bring you." Now the Hai looks closer at the plant. "I see that this is an unusual plant but why is this a prove of friendship with another species?" You answer him, "This plant was genmanipulated to a degree that it can survive in nearly any climate, this is nothing humans could have done." The Hai looks at you, "You mind if we test this? We will make sure to not use to extreme methods, we do not want to kill it." You agree. The Hai gets two helpers to carry the plant and tells you to wait for his return.`
			`    About an hour later the Hai returns with the plant and a excited looking face. "This plant is wonder, we exposed it to various environmental factors and some of them were really extreme, but all that happened was that the air got more breathable.

We do not want to dismiss their request, but we also have concerns. Not concerns about you anymore, but concerns about what happens after you made contact. This will change this species for sure. But we do not know in which direction. But here comes the one reason, why we will allow you to make contact and giive you a translation device. If this species continues the path it currently is moving on. It will lead to their distinction. We see this for some time now, but we can not step in, because that is not our role in this galaxy. But you, you can change something and now that the Hai have proved you, we do not have concerns about you anymore." It takes something that looks like a tablet and hands it you.

This also works over video communication, you just have to hold it, so that the back of the device shows to the screen. Also their language is a lot different than yours, human, you will see what that means." You take the device and thank it. "Oh, and two other things, if you sell hyperdrives or other advanced spacetravelling technology to them we will remotely destroy them, and second, if you ever try to harm them, we will harm you. I hope this is alright for you." A little bit shocked you agree. "Go now and make contact to them. We will give the Hai a ride home." Without any further words, he leaves you alone.`
