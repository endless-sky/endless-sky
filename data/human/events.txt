		log "Factions" "Alphas" `The Alphas were designed hundreds of years ago as genetically engineered super-soldiers, with no compassion or empathy. They escaped from their masters, enslaved entire planets, and commanded massive fleets of ships. Eventually they were defeated, and were either killed or went into hiding. They can be recognized by their green, photosynthetic skin.`
			`Alphas can live for centuries, and it is likely that many of them have survived, hiding out on anarchist worlds or somewhere beyond human space. Fortunately, they reproduce much more slowly than ordinary humans do.`
		conversation
			`Today, throughout human space, is Remembrance Day, the anniversary of the beginning of the Alpha Wars more than five centuries ago. The Alphas were genetically engineered soldiers, with superhuman agility and intelligence, and a complete lack of compassion or empathy. At the height of the War, dozens of planets had been enslaved by the Alphas.`
			`	Remembrance Day commemorates the beginning of the war, rather than its end, as a perpetual reminder that the war is not over: although the Alphas were defeated, some of them escaped and remained in hiding, and they and their offspring are presumed to still be present in the galaxy today.`
			`	Since the Alpha War, genetic resequencing technology has been very tightly controlled. Because the Alphas were the product of experimental genetic manipulation rather than natural evolution, it is believed that their genes are less robust than true human beings, and they are almost unable to have viable offspring without access to special technology. Therefore, most Alpha enclaves that have been discovered since the War have had very small populations, no more than a few dozen.`
			`	In these days when the Navy ensures peace throughout much of the galaxy, on many worlds the Alphas are treated as nothing more than a bogeyman story to frighten children. Because the most striking physical feature of the Alphas was their photosynthetic skin, on some worlds kids even run around wearing green face paint on Remembrance Day, trying to frighten people. But on other worlds, especially on the fringes of space where the Navy seldom patrols, the Alphas are still spoken of with fear.`

	planet "Arabia"
		add spaceport `	Despite the climate and population, a small procession, consisting of security guards and port workers, is gathered in the spaceport to celebrate Remembrance Day.`
	planet "Big Sky"
		add spaceport `	A large gathering of locals is congregated around a memorial in the spaceport, likely to commemorate the upcoming Remembrance Day. The memorial is devoid of the native flora.`
	planet "Bounty"
		add spaceport `	The local residents are also setting up decorations in the marketplace in preparation for Remembrance Day.`
	planet "Clark"
		add spaceport `	This heightened mood carries over into the planet's Remembrance Day festivities. All around the spaceport, you can hear songs echo and blend.`
	planet "Gemstone"
		add spaceport `	In commemoration of Remembrance Day, the local residents have set up a few flags of in the spaceport. You doubt that anybody here could afford any more than what is already set up.`
	planet "Heartland"
		add spaceport `	One section of the tractor showcase appears to currently be dedicated to antique tractors back from the Alpha Wars. On one landing pad, you spot some dock workers unloading a gigantic tractor out from a bulk freighter's hold.`
	planet "Hopper"
		add spaceport `	The inn has been repurposed for hosting Remembrance Day celebrations. A canvas just above its entrance reads, "For those who have fallen, and those who will fall." The canvas is already dappled.`
	planet "Ingot"
		add spaceport `	The decorations for Remembrance Day on this planet amount to a single batch of flags placed in the middle of the trading hub.`
	planet "New Argentina"
		add spaceport `	The Grange is currently set up for Remembrance Day celebrations. The population inside consists mostly of the older residents of the planet, many of them likely having traveled tens of thousands of kilometers to arrive here.`
	planet "New Austria"
		add spaceport `	The town is abuzz in preparation for Remembrance Day. Decorations have been set up on every building you can see, and you can hear songs coming from the town's tavern.`
	planet "New Boston"
		add spaceport `	A smaller tent has been set up beside the market. Inside are various pamphlets for Remembrance Day events occuring on New Boston.`
	planet "New Britain"
		add spaceport `	In celebration of the upcoming Remembrance Day, the night sky above the port is densely occupied by choreographed drone formations, starship stunt flying and firework showcases.`
	planet "New Greenland"
		add spaceport `	New Greenland was one of the worlds that was occupied during the Alpha Wars. Despite this, the celebrations on New Greenland are quite humble, most of the locals simply going about business as usual.`
	planet "New Holland"
		add spaceport `	Modest Remembrance Day decorations have been set up around the spaceport, and in the distance, you can see marginally more lavish decorations set up within the main city.`
	planet "New Iceland"
		add spaceport `	The caustic climate makes it difficult for the local populace to celebrate Remembrance Day properly, though a small entourage has gathered in the cafeteria regardless.`
	planet "New India"
		add spaceport `	Despite the relative recency of settlement, Remembrance Day celebrations still appear to be occuring, with Alpha War shanties audible from one of the spaceport buildings.`
	planet "New Kansas"
		add spaceport `	A group of locals are gathered in a tavern in the western part of the spaceport. The building is decorated with Remembrance Day memorabilia, and you can see several people showing off knitted patterns inside.`
	planet "New Portland"
		add spaceport `	It appears that the spaceport has not been embellished for the upcoming Remembrance Day. You assume that the main preparations are taking place in the planet's towns proper.`
	planet "New Sahara"
		add spaceport `	The living quarters have been modestly decorated for Remembrance Day, with ceremonial flags being set up inside the dining halls, and a showcase of medals being set up on a wall, each one belonging to the ancestors of those who live here now.`
	planet "New Tibet"
		add spaceport `	Befitting their more isolationist stance, the port has not been dolled up for Remembrance Day, though you are able to make out a celebration taking place in the city below.`
	planet "New Wales"
		add spaceport `	Some of the workers are setting up Remembrance Day decorations in the cafeteria. One of them asks you how other planets celebrate the day.`
	planet "Oblivion"
		add spaceport `	Compared to the rest of the Dirt Belt, the people of Oblivion are not particularily keen on celebrating Remembrance Day. It appears that the younger population of the planet have little concern for events from several centuries ago.`
	planet "Rand"
		add spaceport `	The Remembrance Day preparations on Rand are unusually sparse compared to its population. It appears that most people have opted to return to their families on another planet to celebrate the day, though in one corner of the spaceport, you can hear a group of friends singing Alpha War shanties.`
	planet "Sinter"
		add spaceport `	The only sign that Remembrance Day is celebrated on this planet is a single monitor in the spaceport displaying the text, "Happy Remembrance Day!"`
	planet "Valhalla"
		add spaceport `	Despite the Deep's importance to defeating the Alphas, Remembrance Day is seldom celebrated in the region. The only thing you see out of the ordinary is a milk dish on the counter of an information booth.`


event "remembrance day ends"
	planet "Alexandria"
		spaceport `The station's cavernous visitor center is by far the quietest spaceport you have ever been in. Many people are bustling back and forth, wheeling carts of old books or carrying data pads, but they are entirely silent except for the occasional startled outburst when a scholar, walking deep in thought or immersed in reading, accidentally collides with someone.`
		spaceport `	From here, passageways lead off into the wings of the library in a veritable labyrinth of hallways, stairs, and library stacks. A few particularly heavy doors require key cards to enter, and others have no opening controls of any sort that you can see.`
	planet "Allhome"
		spaceport `In the spaceport, a handful of human merchants and colonists wander about amid throngs of Hai - vaguely squirrel-like aliens who are somewhat shorter than the average human being, but make up for it with an abundance of energy. You feel a little bit like an adult wading through a sea of hyperactive children as you try to locate the commodity exchange and the other services offered here.`
	planet "Arabia"
		spaceport `The spaceport consists mostly of a wide, open field paved in asphalt, the cheapest material available here. The pavement shimmers with heat, and is pockmarked with divots where ships' landing gear has sunk several centimeters in to the surface.`
		spaceport `	At the center of the pavement is a small cluster of refrigerated sheds and stacks of crates carrying various goods for trade; a few armed guards patrol around them to prevent theft. A food truck is parked nearby, serving burgers and tacos to the port workers and to the crews of the few starships that are parked here at the moment.`
	planet "Big Sky"
		spaceport `The landing pads here are being gradually consumed by the local plant life. In most places grass and ivy has crept out to cover at least a meter of the pad on all sides, and every small crack or crevice has been colonized by moss and by the roots of larger plants. In places the forest has been cleared to make roads leading to the nearby farming villages, but in most directions all you see is green. It is a beautiful sight, and oddly peaceful, but you know what a nuisance these plants are to the locals.`
	planet "Bounty"
		spaceport `The spaceport is not fancy, but it is serviceable: the landing pads are very level and show only minor signs of wear and tear, and the one warehouse is tiny but recently built, and its roof is in good repair. Next to it is a marketplace building, with three walls and a pitched roof, and the fourth side open for people and trucks to come and go. An enterprising cook is selling lamb kebabs from a small grill and cart in one corner of the building.`
	planet "Clark"
		spaceport `The spaceport is at the heart of one of Clark's largest cities, surrounded by smokestacks and factories. There are a few hangars owned by different corporations where their cargo ships can load and unload, but you are relegated to a set of concrete landing pads farther from the main buildings. Large trucks rumble by carrying carts loaded down with cargo crates.`
		spaceport `	In the central building, dozens of workers fill a large cafeteria with several stations serving different types of food. The mood here feels boisterous and energetic, very different from most of the Dirt Belt worlds you have visited.`
	planet "Gemstone"
		spaceport `The spaceport is perched on top of a peak in an older and more stable mountain range. The landing pads here are used both by starships and by the helicopters that bring cargo to and from the mines. Overhead, helicopters fly by carrying heavy loads dangling from cables. A few low cement buildings serve as warehouses, and on the far end of the port, where an explosion would do the least damage if a sudden, severe earthquake struck, large steel tanks hold deuterium for refueling ships. Asphalt roads with flimsy guard rails connect the landing pads to the warehouses.`
	planet "Heartland"
		spaceport `The spaceport is a cluster of low buildings. At the center of the port is a special, taller building with glass walls on all sides. It houses the tractor showroom. The farmers visiting the showroom look about as excited as you do when touring a large and well-appointed shipyard. There are tractors with rubber wheels, spiked wheels, and tracks; with plows, combines, balers, and chaser bins; tractors barely big enough to sit on and tractors the size of a small freighter. It's somewhat overwhelming.`
	planet "Hopper"
		spaceport `The spaceport consists mostly of a cluster of steel-framed warehouses with tin roofs, surrounded by concrete slabs for ships to land on. Scattered among the warehouses are a few smaller wooden buildings, housing a pub, a restaurant, and a small inn. Some of the warehouses are relatively new, with metal that still gleams; others are covered in rust, and a few stand in ruins, with large holes worn through their roofs and rusted girders poking through like dead trees.`
	planet "Ingot"
		spaceport `In this spaceport, ships dock inside a hangar whose ceiling protects them from meteorite impacts. The hangar is not pressurized, so there are also landing tubes that connect to each of the visiting ships. Many of the people inside are carrying emergency oxygen masks in case a sudden impact ruptures the building.`
		spaceport `	In addition to being the spaceport, this complex is also the repair and control center for the mining robots. There are a handful of buildings elsewhere on Ingot, but not many. You cannot imagine spending so much time with so little space or change of scenery.`
	planet "New Argentina"
		spaceport `The spaceport is on the outskirts of one of New Argentina's largest towns... which has a population of barely ten thousand people. Many of the dock workers are teenagers or barely past their teens, children of ranchers who are not drawn to the solitary sort of life that their parents enjoy. Aside from the church and the hospital, the largest building in town is "The Grange," a function hall with a sign out front advertising square dances and line dances three nights a week.`
	planet "New Austria"
		spaceport `The spaceport is nothing but a couple of landing pads built on the outskirts of one of the larger mining villages, high up on a mountain ridge to allow easy access for starships. A few roads lead down from there to the village, where you can trade for local goods or get food from the miners' cafeteria. By the time you have walked to the center of the town, several people have already tried to sell you large "diamonds" that you strongly suspect are just clear sapphires.`
	planet "New Boston"
		spaceport `Some day New Boston may be a prosperous enough planet to afford a better spaceport, but not yet. Many of the concrete landing pads have sunk into the muddy soil over the years since they were poured, and are now tilted and uneven. The market where ship captains buy and sell cargo is a large tent rather than a permanent building, but it is sturdy enough to keep off the rain, and high enough for loads to be brought in and out by trucks and the occasional hovercraft. And, some enterprising local mechanics have set up not only a repair shop and outfitter, but also a shipyard with several small, refurbished ships for sale.`
	planet "New Britain"
		spaceport `The spaceport is a granite ziggurat, a step pyramid with landing pads and hangars on each level. On the top levels are the dining areas and meeting rooms for corporate visitors; the lower floors provide warehouse and storage space. Compared to the relatively traditional architecture of the city nearby, the spaceport looks out of place, even absurd. But to the locals, it is meant as a clear display to visitors that even though they are in a region of space known for poor and sparsely populated worlds, this particular world is far more developed.`
	planet "New Greenland"
		spaceport `The spaceport is near the equator, but it is still cold enough that there is always some snow on the ground. In addition to the outdoor landing pads a few hangars are available: an effort by the locals to make their world a little more appealing to merchants passing through the system. You have never seen as many people in fur coats as there are here; what might be considered a luxury in other parts of the galaxy is a necessity here, where the cheapest clothing material is the pelts of indigenous animals.`
		spaceport `	From the size of the claws hanging decoratively off some of the coats, you have to give a grudging respect to the hunters. High fashion is not an industry that usually involves risk of dismemberment.`
	planet "New Holland"
		spaceport `The spaceport is on the fringes of one of the factory towns. In the distance are row after row of identical brick buildings; in the opposite direction, a safe distance from the city, are the cooling towers of several nuclear power plants. The port itself is laid out for maximum efficiency in loading and unloading cargo regardless of the weather or time of day: a row of hangars, open at one side to ships coming in and departing, and on the other to a road carrying a steady stream of trucks.`
	planet "New Iceland"
		spaceport `Almost as soon as you stepped off your ship, your eyes began to sting. You try to breathe as shallowly as possible.`
		spaceport `	This port consists of a single large hangar, only big enough for two or three bulk freighters, plus some overflow landing pads and old rusted storage sheds outside. There is a small cafeteria, offering you a choice between two kinds of soup, some pre-made sandwiches, or the hot meal of the day.`
	planet "New India"
		spaceport `New India's spaceport is a ring of low wooden buildings around a wide landing area paved with concrete slabs. Around the perimeter carts of trade goods are driven, some being pulled by tractors and others, by horses or oxen. You even think you see a few carts being pulled by water buffalo.`
		spaceport `	Most of the buildings are for storage, but from somewhere nearby you can smell fresh-baked bread.`
	planet "New Kansas"
		spaceport `The spaceport includes several stores selling wool garments, each worth easily ten times as much as the clothes you are wearing. A few of the visitors milling around seem genuinely interested in the clothing, but most of them, like you, are just ship captains who see wool clothing as nothing more than a pricey luxury good that can be sold elsewhere for a good profit.`
		spaceport `	The port authority employs several people on horseback whose sole job is to keep the landing pads clear of wild sheep.`
	planet "New Portland"
		spaceport `The largest town on New Portland has set aside a landing area for ships, but it is barely what could be called a spaceport. Aside from the refueling station and a few sheds, there are no other buildings, just an open field of packed gravel, with grass and weeds peeking up in places where it has avoided the blast from landing spacecraft. A few farmers have parked wagons here and are trading food and other goods with the visiting ships.`
	planet "New Sahara"
		spaceport `The spaceport consists of a few large concrete slabs, each big enough for a dozen small ships or a pair of bulk freighters to land on. Farther away are fields of solar panels and the factories that they power. The spaceport buildings themselves, however, are underground, where less energy is needed to keep the air cool. Light pipes bring sunlight down from the surface to illuminate the subterranean storage caverns and living quarters, while keeping the searing heat of the sunlight out.`
	planet "New Tibet"
		spaceport `The spaceport is in a hilly region, just outside of the largest city, with a view of a valley full of farms that stretch for tens of kilometers, all the way down to the ocean. The port is much less modern than the city nearby; it was built by the early settlers and has not been significantly updated since then, because the focus has been on improving life for the locals, not for their occasional visitors.`
	planet "New Wales"
		spaceport `The warehouses at the spaceport are kept under continuous guard due to the high value of the refined metals they contain. There are several missile silos and laser turrets as well; New Wales has survived several pirate attacks in the last decade. Within the spaceport cafeteria, however, the locals are quite friendly and excited to connect with visitors and hear news of the outside world. The cafeteria is cooking lamb stew, and the smell of it pervades the whole building.`
	planet "Oblivion"
		spaceport `The spaceport is a long landing strip paved in asphalt, with warehouses on either side of it constructed from stone and mortar. Inside are stacked lead-lined crates of radioactive materials for sale. Unlike many Dirt Belt worlds, you see few curious children watching ships land or playing among the buildings; this is not the sort of world where many people choose to put down roots and build a family.`
	planet "Rand"
		spaceport `The landing pads here are poured concrete, raised up slightly above the level of the desert to keep them from being buried in sand. A few workers are constantly driving brush sweepers across the unoccupied pads. The air is filled with sand particles and dust. Aside from the storage sheds, there are only two buildings, each with a large sign out front: "Labor" and "Trade."`
	planet "Sinter"
		spaceport `The spaceport is built next to a large smelter where ore is processed into metal ingots. Even on a planet as inhospitable as this one, the cost of extracting metal from ore is still cheaper than the cost of shipping the ore off-world for processing. A long enclosed terminal building extends out from the smelter, with docking tubes and landing pads every few hundred meters for connecting to visiting ships. Small robotic trolleys carry cargo crates back and forth; only a handful of people are walking around here, and most of them are probably off-worlders.`
	planet "Valhalla"
		spaceport `Surrounding the spaceport is a metropolis of skyscrapers and factories that spreads all the way to the horizon in every direction.`
		spaceport `	The spaceport itself is an imposing building, composed of three towers rising over a hundred stories into the air and connected at various levels by bridges. The docking bays are on the higher levels, with warehouse space lower down and loading platforms for trucks at ground level. Massive cargo elevators run up and down in the center of each building, and the hallways are all wide enough to allow small robotic carts and forklifts in addition to foot traffic.`

		description `The Republic Navy has planted a base on New Wales: so far, just a densely packed cluster of prefabricated barracks and infirmary buildings on the outskirts of one of the mining colonies.`

		description `The few settlements that have been built here were developed for mining sapphires and rubies. The sapphires found in New Austria range from blue to yellow to black to clear in color, and are used both for industrial abrasives and for jewelry.`
		description `For centuries the locals have tried to find a deposit of diamonds, and local folklore revolves around the prosperity that would come to this world if diamonds were ever discovered.`
		description `The Navy has recently requisitioned one of the abandoned mining towns and begun refurbishing it for a secure military base, with the mining tunnels used as deep underground bunkers.`

The atmosphere here is too thin to breathe without a respirator, and because of the low gravity, the dust raised by the mining operations hangs perpetually in the air.`
		description `The miners who work here are a tight-knit group, since most of them were part of the original colonization team. They are not particularly open to outsiders, and the facilities here are so rudimentary that they do not even stock fuel for visiting ships.`

The planet was not settled until about a century ago, when a group of investors from Pherkad decided to build a manufacturing center here, rather than trying to find more land on the already overcrowded planet of Solace. Claiming that the industrial emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases would eventually warm the planet and turn it into a tropical paradise, they were able to draw enough settlers to keep the factories going.`
		description `	Winter is home to the Free Worlds Conservatory, a new university that is focused on making terraforming technology and expertise available at a reasonable price, as well as on ecological protection and renewal.`

		description `Thule is a mountainous world with a population of nearly a billion, settled in the early days of space exploration. When the colony was first established, the Earth government did not yet have the strength to control any system but its own, and when the Republic was formed, Thule did not join, and has repulsed all efforts to force them to do so.`
		description `	Until recently, Thule was a well-known den of pirate activity, but the major tribal authorities have now forsworn piracy in the interest of keeping the Free Worlds from further meddling in their affairs. However, it is likely that all manner of illegal activity is still going on in secret here.`
	planet "Smuggler's Den"
		description `Smuggler's Den was formerly known as Grendel Station, back when it was an operating refinery. After that, it was taken over by pirates, and became a haven for all manner of smugglers and privateers. Now, at least in theory it is an independent station, no longer allied with the pirates. In practice, you suspect a fair amount of piracy still goes on here.`
		description `The repair shops here can make a variety of legal and illegal modifications to your ship, and in the shipyard you can buy refurbished starships... if it does not trouble your conscience to think about the likely fates of their previous owners.`
		spaceport `It is a strange but indisputable fact that anarchists smell worse than ordinary human beings. In this day and age, where even the cheapest shuttlecraft at least has a sonic shower, there is no logical explanation for it, except that anarchist tendencies must somehow go hand in hand with a tendency to reject society's norms around hygiene. Here in a space station, with nothing but recycled air to breathe, the effect is overpowering.`

		description `New Austria is a rugged mountain world, full of snow-capped peaks and valleys so deep and so steep that they rarely see sunlight.`
		description `The few settlements that have been built here were developed for mining sapphires and rubies. The sapphires found in New Austria range from blue to yellow to black to clear in color, and are used both for industrial abrasives and for jewelry.`
		description `For centuries the locals have been trying to find a deposit of diamonds, which would sell for much higher prices than sapphires, and local folklore revolves around the prosperity that would come to this world if diamonds were ever discovered.`

		description `Geminus, although not the most hospitable of worlds, is a young enough planet that large stores of iron, titanium, and other metals are easily accessible near the surface. The constant volcanic activity leaves the planet perpetually shrouded in a twilight haze of ash and fog.`
		description `	The shattered remnants of the old Navy Yard are still left abandoned and slowly rusting away in the planet's caustic atmosphere, but the Republic has now built a new shipyard to replace the one destroyed in the bombing, and once again Geminus has become a central hub of technology and industry.`
		spaceport `Like everything else on Geminus, the spaceport is not terribly pretty, but is functional and efficient. Each of the wide hallways is marked out like a road, with space in the center for electric carts carrying cargo, while pedestrians are relegated to the edges. Video cameras and sensors have been placed at every intersection, and access to the shipbuilding facilities is tightly controlled.`
		spaceport `	The hub of the spaceport is a food court with a ring of shops in the center and seating on the outside, where you can look out of plate glass windows at the lava fields and caldera outside. By night, you can see the volcanic glow all around the horizon.`
