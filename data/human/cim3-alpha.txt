It's good you didn't: as you land you see a masive Vanguard land next to you, and out steps none other than Downey himself!	When he recognises your ship, he comes over flanked by half a dozen well-armed guards.`
			`	"<last>! What are you doing here! I told you to wait in Delta Capricorni!"`

			`	Downey scowles. "Do you think every ghost and monster from your childhood is a fiction to shut you up at night? These things are real! And they'll blow your brains out in seconds if you're not careful." He calms down a bit having let off steam. "Alphas attacked facilities on Bluestone, up in Bellatrix near the edge of civilised space. They've abducted all the young women they can find, for breeding, and are heading to some pirate world where they can't be found. But we have blockaded Moktar and Zaurak, so they can't get out.`

You also remember some Free Worlds propaganda you heard recently, that a Republic planet in their territory got captured by Alphas and the Free Worlds bravely drove them off... with the help of a Navy admiral. If it's true, perhaps that same admiral could help now? It gets the Republic involved... but might give a better chance of rescuing the women. Do you want to try and contact him?`

Sometimes the ship lurches in space, and through the silence of the ship you can feel their screams. Something must be wrong. Will you find us before they kill us? We have no idea where they are taking us. Each day we take solace in each others' arms, but we have no power to change our destiny.`

Meanwhile I will try and get a proper fix on those Alphas, so we can catch them once and for all and rescue these valiant women."`

Their captors panicked, and rushed them all out through a service tunnel, but the women gave them so much trouble the Alphas became desperate and nearly got found out. When they made their final dash for - what must be the new shuttle - some of the women sat down and had to be dragged, so the Alphas grabbed four of them and shut a grate on the others trapping them inside, until the officer found them now.`
			`	It takes some time to debrief the flustered women, and when it's done, the lieutenant turns to you and suggests you'd better get in touch with "our mutual friend-of-the-chair." Included in the group is Nikki, but not her sister Vicky. Would you like to talk with her first?`

			`	"You found it then! It worked! Is that how you found us then?"`
			`	"It was a big help," you say, "and well thought of." You tell her about the visit to her grandma, and how she's looking forward desperately to seeing her again. You also ask her about Vicky.`
			`	"She would always look after me. I'm two hours older than her, you know, but she was the grown-up. I think, when we got captured, it broke her. Nothing she could do for her sister: nothing but sit and walk and comply. We felt so alone, but at least we had each other. Oh, Captain, will you find her? Will you find her and the others? And catch those men for us. They're evil, pure evil." She shudders.`

			`	You both pause, then you have an idea.`
			`	"They can't get out in a heavy shuttle, right?"`
			`	"Right," says Arnold.`
			`	"What they need is something fast."`
			`	"Right again. So, we stop them getting a faster ship."`
			`	"Wrong," you say. "We give them a faster ship."`
			`	"What? Have you gone crazy?"`
			`	"Think about it. We drop a faster ship, keys in the ignition, right into their laps. But since we prepared the ship..."`
			`	"...we put a tracker on! It's genius! I'll get on it right away." Arnold pauses. "We'll have to be careful. They can't have any hint. This could take some time. I'll contact you when the ship's ready, then you can escort her here. Great thinking, <first>. We'll get them this time, I know we will."`

	`Your three ships land side by side. Your own, Arnold's sleek Blackbird, and Jana's great, hulking Protector. As a trio you march up to the Syndicate headquarters, and enter the complex. Arnold is not so much marching: he's in an elaborate wheelchair flanked by all manner of fancy electronics. Jana is dressed in a leather bra and short skirt, with her longbow slung behind her. "It makes the men so confused," she says. "They don't know what to think."`

Each quails at your trio, and many gaze wide-eyed at Jana in her tanned skin, leather dress, and wild look in her eyes. But none dares accost you. At last you reach the top. The office of 'Alistair Korban, CEO'. Without knocking, you enter.`
	choice
		`	(enter Korban's office)`
	`	Korban is startled as you enter, but regains his composure and recognises you. "Captain... <last>." He stammers. "It's good that you've come... I was about to... I need you... to go to Sol." As he speaks, his eyes flick between the three of you, but especially to Jana and her longbow sticking up prominently behind her head. You remain silent.`
	`	"Our peace, and the Galaxy, are under threat from the so-called Free Worlds. I have sent a fleet to Sol to protect the galactic government, lest the militia attack the very seat of our union. I... need you to escort some freighters with supplies for the protection fleet, then join them."`
	`	You continue to stand in silence and stare at Korban, who gets increasingly nervous. At last Arnold hands you a file, which you place in front of Korban.`
	choice
		`	(tell him his time is up)`
	`	"This is a record of your crimes," you say. Read them, and understand." Shocked, Korban starts leafing through, under your trio's intimidating gaze.`

	`	You pull out your last document, the one you showed to each of the guards on the way up, the one you retrieved from the file on the Alphas' ship.`
	`		--The bearer is acting on the authority of the Syndicate. They should be allowed to pass without let or hindrance. Signed, Alistair Korban, CEO.--`
	`	He looks at you, wild-eyed, and half whispers. "I... They weren't supposed to do that... with this..."`
	choice
		`	(continue)`
	`	Jana reaches for Korban's desk, pulls out a sheet of Syndicate headed paper, and lays it before him. "Your resignation," she says. Korban stares and says nothing. Silence. Then, slowly, Arnold rises from his wheelchair. Shaking a little, and grabbing your arm for support, he stands up and steps over to the desk. He reaches in his pocket, and pulls out a golden pen. On it is written, in beautiful cursive letters, "My First Resignation Pen". He sits down, exhausted.`
	`	"Write it," you command.`
	``
	`	"Never!" Suddenly Korban springs to life, and blood flushes his cheeks. He rips up the incriminating document and throws it behind him. "Never! Not until the galaxy is rent apart! Not until the shadows of the gods themselves come down and threaten our very existence!"`
	`	"So be it," you say. "You have spoken." And, as one, the three of you turn and leave.`
	``
	`	As you reach the spaceport, shaking inside, your pocket shakes too. In there is a device connected to the scanning network for the tracker on the Alphas' ship, silent since you did the swap. Now, it awakes. Beep... Beep... Beep...`
