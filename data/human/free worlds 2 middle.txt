After arriving he hid his ship in a cave, just before a Syndicate fleet appeared in orbit. They do not know where the defector landed, so they have begun searching settlement to settlement under the assumption that one is harboring him. They are currently here, wrecking the monastery in their hunt."`
			`	After a moment, JJ says, "If these allegations are true, if we can prove that the Free Worlds were innocent of any involvement in those attacks, the Republic might make peace with us, or at least agree to a ceasefire. I vote that we try to shelter this defector and hear his story."`

Many more civilians will be killed if we continue to fight without their backing, and we don't even know what this supposed evidence actually is.

I'm sorry for the confusion, but please understand. We're hunting a terrorist. This man claiming that we are the ones that caused the bombings is, in fact, the leader of the extremist group that caused them. He developed the nukes with the help of a faction of pirates looking to profit from the instability, and now, when we're finally close to capturing him, he's attempting to frame us for his own crimes against humanity. Allow us to find him, and we'll-"`
			`	The feed cuts off. "The message ended there," the communications officer says. The room falls silent.`
			`	JJ breaks the silence. "I still say we rescue this defector. The Syndicate could be lying to us. They don't exactly have a reputation for upstanding morality, after all."`
			`	"Or this 'defector' could easily be the one lying," Freya says. "I say we let them have him while we focus on defending against the Navy. If the Syndicate gets their hands on the true terrorist, their support will surely clear our name. Parliament won't be able to ignore the Syndicate vindicating us."`

			`It doesn't take long to find the monastery that contacted you earlier; nothing is left of it but the burnt-out shells of buildings. You hurry to land and look around for survivors. You find several corpses dressed in maroon robes, some of them badly burnt, but no sign of the defector or the monk who sent the message.`
			choice
				`	(Wait to see if anyone approaches now that the Syndicate fleet is gone.)`
				`	(Give up and contact the rest of the Free Worlds fleet to figure out what to do next.)`
					goto leave
			`	You wait around for a while, but this mountain valley seems to be entirely desolate. Then finally, when you are about to give up hope, Freya spots the distant figures of a few dozen people coming down the side of one of the mountains.`
				goto gunboat
			label leave
			`	You are just about to leave when Freya spots something and points. "Look," she says, "someone is coming down the mountain slope toward us." Sure enough, it's a group of several dozen people wearing the distinctive robes of the monks.`
			label gunboat
			`	As you wait for them to approach, JJ receives a message from one of the militia crews. "Sir, you have incoming! A scout ship, with Republic markings. Apparently unarmed. Shall we intercept them?"`
			`	"Oathkeepers?" asks JJ. "Or ordinary Navy? Who are they?"`
			`	The voice on the other end pauses. "Neither. Navy Intelligence."`
			`	JJ thinks about that for a second, then says, "Let them land. But follow them down, and if you see so much as a hint of them powering up weapons, blow them out of the sky. Understand?" The officer acknowledges his order and signs off.`
			`	As the group of monks approaches from the mountainside, the scout ship comes in for a landing and skids to a halt in the dirt a few dozen meters away. A woman steps off it. She has dark skin, and is dressed entirely in black. Even the whites of her eyes are black: when she gets closer, you can see that it is actually a scleric tattoo, an intricate Celtic knotwork pattern inked into the whites of her eyes. She sees you staring at her, and winks at you with a friendly grin.`
			choice
				`	"I'm Captain <last> of the Free Worlds. What is your business here?"`
				`	"Who are you, and what gives you the right to land on our planet?"`
					goto hostile
			`	"My name is Raven," she says. "I'm here to question this defector. If he is telling the truth, our war with you will end today." She pauses, then adds, grimly, "And, another war will begin."`
				goto questioning
			label hostile
			`	She frowns. "My name is Raven," she says. "I am here to question this defector. If you are interested in knowing the truth, you will allow me to do so."`
			label questioning
			`	The monks approach, and you see that among them is a man in more ordinary attire, who must be the defector. "Now," says Raven, "I will question him alone, on my ship."`
			choice
				`	"No, we insist on being present for your interrogation."`
					goto present
				`	"Very well, we'll wait outside."`
			`	"No!" says JJ. "We're staying here."`
			label present
			`	She hesitates for a long moment. This is probably going against whatever orders she is following. But finally she says, "Very well." The monks step aside. She approaches the defector, and reaches out her hands to him. Hesitantly, he takes her hands. It's an oddly intimate scene, the two of them quietly holding hands and locking eyes - not like any interrogation you have seen before. "Now," she says, "tell me your story."`
			`	"My name is Sawyer," says the man. "I'm a physicist, a Syndicate employee. We had a secret project on Mutiny, a planet in a pirate system. We were developing nuclear weapons." He hesitates, and looks away for a second, then says, "They told me it was for fighting the pirates. I didn't realize otherwise until--"`
			`	"That is a lie," says Raven, calmly.`
			`	He seems flustered. "Okay, they didn't tell me what the weapons were for, and I didn't ask."`
			choice
				`	"Why would the Syndicate attack the Republic?"`
				`	"Why did you wait so long to report this?"`
					goto wait
			`	They both seem surprised at you asking a question. Sawyer says, "War is good for business, especially if you're in the business of making weapons. The Syndicate's profits have more than doubled since this conflict began."`
			`	"What led you to report this?" asks Raven.`
			label wait
			`	He says, "It was when I heard that there had been another major battle. Up until then I had been telling myself that the worst of the damage was done. But after that battle, I knew that millions more could die because of our crime, and that I had the power to stop it."`
			`	Raven continues to ask questions: who was involved, how the facility was hidden, where the raw materials came from. At one point, JJ pulls you aside and says, "She must be a Questioner. How they operate is a tightly kept secret. I'd always assumed their methods were... a bit more medieval."`
			`	Finally, Raven is satisfied, and radios her ship. "He's telling the truth," she tells them. "Send word to the admirals at once. And, release the captive."`
			`	The door of her ship slides open, and another woman steps out - shakily, hesitantly, shielding her eyes against the sunlight. It takes you a few seconds to realize that it's Katya.`
			`	As you all rush over to greet Katya, Raven taps your shoulder and says quietly, "Meet me in the main spaceport in a few hours and we'll figure out what's going to happen next." She returns to her ship.`
