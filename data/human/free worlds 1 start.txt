			`The mood in the spaceport is solemn. No one has had time yet to count up the losses, on both sides of the battle, but it is likely that over a thousand lives were lost. And because the Navy is held in such high regard even here where Parliament and the Paradise Planets are viewed with disgust, many of the militia captains are almost as saddened by the loss of Navy lives as by the loss of some of their own.`
			`	You find Tomek walking among the fleet, conversing with a large group of captains and crew members and assessing the damage they have suffered. When he sees you he says, "Captain <last>! How is your <ship> holding together?"`
			choice
				`	"She took a bit of a pounding, but I've patched her up."`
				`	"Just fine. It'd take more than a few Cruisers to destroy the <ship>."`
			
			`	"Glad to hear it," he says before returning to the crowd. "Listen! We need to press our advantage before the Republic has time to call for reinforcements. If we strike quickly, we could be able to retake Kornephoros from them. It's important to break the blockade on that system for the sake of trade with the rest of the galaxy. And on top of that, if you were not aware, Councilor Katya Reynolds was on Clink when the Navy took the system and needs to be rescued." You hear some chatter coming from the crowd as a result of this news; it seems like Katya's investigation on Clink was not public knowledge.`
			`	"We have a large fleet of reinforcements coming in from the Rim," Tomek continues, "and a few ships here that are able to fight another battle. I need you all to take off, wait for the reinforcements to arrive, and then retake Kornephoros. If the Navy ships retreat, let them retreat. If they surrender, let them surrender. If they stay and fight, disable them if you can. Destroy them only if you must. Am I understood?"`
			`	"Yes sir!" the captains respond in unison.`
			`	"Then move out!" Tomek yells, prompting the captains and crew to scramble for their ships.`

Our militia is very loosely organized, but I'm the one in charge of organizing it." That gets a few laughs from the Free Worlds guards. "As such, I am responsible for deciding your fate."`
			`	At that, a hush falls over the crowd. "The Council has decided," he continues, "that any of you who gives us your parole, swearing to take no further part in fighting the Free Worlds, will be returned to Republic space. You will give us your word of honor that you will either seek reassignment in another part of the galaxy, or resign your commission."`
			`	A few of the Free Worlds guards shout, "What?" But only a surprising few. The rest are nodding, seemingly pleased with the Council's choice. Tomek climbs down from the hull and approaches the prisoners, and you notice Alondo and Freya have joined him.`
			`	One of the Navy officers stands up. "I'll take that oath," he says, "if you'll honor your part of it."`
			`	Tomek takes the man's hands, looks him in the eyes, and asks, "Do you swear before God and these witnesses to take no further part in military actions against the Free Worlds?"`
			`	"I do," says the officer. Several of the other prisoners stand up, and before long all but a handful have sworn the oath.`
			`	After they finish, Tomek turns to you and a few other captains. "Emily, Marco, <first>, Sarah, please meet me in the spaceport cafe when you are ready." He walks off.`

			`As you are landing on Poisonwood, Alondo explains, "Three decades ago, this was a slave colony. The Navy was responsible for liberating them, and they still feel a deep debt to the Republic as a result. But even if they do not join us, we can maybe establish more friendly relations with them."`
			`	Soon after you land, the governor of Poisonwood sends an aide to escort you to her office. The governor is probably in her late fifties, and as you are speaking the sunlight occasionally catches her face or arms at exactly the right angle to show the faint, criss-crossing lines of very old scars. She must have been one of the slaves who were freed by the Navy.`
			`	As soon as you are seated, she says, "Now, I don't want to give you false hope. We will not be joining the Free Worlds."`
			`	"Understood," says Alondo. "We've come primarily to assure you that the Free Worlds will never attempt to take control of a planet that has not willingly chosen to join us. But without our support, your world is isolated and vulnerable."`
			`	"Indeed," she says, grimacing. They talk for a while, but it is clear she does not think her people would ever support even a treaty of neutrality with the "rebellion." Finally, she changes the subject. "Captain <last>," she says, "what do you believe is the greatest threat that humanity faces today?"`

That is a danger the Syndicate does face. but I find myself more concerned with certain threats that are closer to home."`

			`	She seems surprised. "Not many in your generation would say that," she says. "Even here on Poisonwood, where we ought to know better, many of those who were born after the days of slavery think the Alphas are no more than a myth, a story that Parliament uses to justify maintaining such a large Navy."`

			`	"Our world was enslaved for nearly a decade," she says. "Most of my childhood. We had been little more than an anarchist colony ourselves before that, though, so the Republic did nothing to aid us. Until the Disappearance."`
			choice
				`	"What was the Disappearance?"`
			
			`	"I was a teenage slave working in the factories at the time," she says. "Exactly the wrong age, as it turned out. One day the overseers informed us that all the eighteen-year-old girls had to have mandatory 'health checkups' that day. I won't describe what the 'checkup' involved, but it was bewildering and unpleasant. And nearly all those girls disappeared, that day. They never returned from the 'checkups.' Only a few of us were left behind. Most of the leftovers were girls who had been unlucky enough to already be pregnant at that age. Or lucky, as it turned out. But I didn't understand why they didn't take me."`
			`	Alondo seems very disturbed by the story. "They were selling girls into prostitution?" he says.`
			`	"That's what we assumed," she says, "but there were dozens of girls like me who were not taken, even though we were not pregnant. It didn't make sense. Anyway, somehow news of that event got off-world and not long after, the Navy came in massive numbers, destroyed the slaver fleets and liberated our planet. In the process, they tried to invade an underground facility up in the mountains, which is where they thought the girls were being kept. But the facility was rigged to self-destruct, and they never found out what had been going on inside the facility. No one inside it survived."`
			choice
				`	"Did you ever find out why they let you go?"`
			
			`	"My parents said it was because I was so willful and stubborn, too hard to control," she says. "But years later, we began to discover that all of us who were passed over had one thing in common. We were all infertile. Had been already, the day of the Disappearance. Which means that either a bunch of pirates had suddenly decided they wanted to leave behind their lives of crime and settle down and raise families... or those girls were being used as incubators."`
			`	Alondo says, "I hear that was common during the Alpha wars. Alpha genetics were so unstable, they needed hundreds of test subjects to produce a handful of viable Alpha babies. Those were evil days."`
			`	"Days that may yet return," she says. "Somewhere, maybe even nearby on Bloodsea or Greenrock or Albatross, the remnants of the Alphas may still be hiding. Creatures bred to be strong and clever and able to kill without a hint of remorse. And now that this sector of space is yours, the duty of defending against them becomes yours, as well. That is why I agreed to talk with you: to warn you of that reality."`
			`	You and Alondo return to your ship with one more thing for the fledgling Free Worlds to worry about. "I guess now we should return to <planet> and report to the Council," he says.`

Alondo outlines the results of the diplomatic mission, which he believes has been a success. Upon hearing about the extra supplies heading to Tarazed, Tomek suggests increasing patrols in the Dirt Belt to the east to help defend Syndicate convoys while also moving supplies from Tarazed to various Free planets.`
			`	"We're still healing from the last set of battles," says JJ. "An increased Free Worlds presence outside of our declared territory could be seen as a provocation."`

			`	"There is one other thing," Alondo says. "The Syndicate informed us that the Republic has Katya in custody, accused of terrorism."`

They're a big threat to our shipping, and every shipment lost to piracy is a dent in our war effort.

			`	"Our first mission will be to Thule in the Men system," Alondo says. "Although Thule is not the biggest hub of piracy in the region, it is the most populous with almost a billion people, a greater population than all the other pirate worlds in the region combined.

Has diplomacy worked during the years of neglect that the Navy has shown us with the constant raids that the South has experienced? No, it didn't!

			`As the remaining invasion fleet comes in for a landing on <origin>, you spot small pirate ships scattering from the spaceport, not into space, but instead into the far reaches of the Greenrock wilderness. When you reach the spaceport, there is a wild mix of emotions from the locals who remained. Some spit at you and curse you out. Others thank you for driving off the pirates, even if only temporarily. Others still thank you for freeing them and ask for transportation off world before the slavers return; Greenrock is the hub of the underground slave trade in the galaxy, and it seems in the confusion and rush for some criminals to escape the spaceport, they left their slaves behind.`
			`	In an attempt to not get yourselves assassinated by pirates looking for revenge, the fleet forms their ships into a circle just outside the spaceport and keeps an eye out for aggressors while waiting for Tomek, or anyone of authority within the Free Worlds for that matter, to show up and determine your next move.`
			`	Hours laters, Tomek's ship arrives, with even more ships in tow, likely to support a continued occupation. Tomek greets the invasion fleet, looking ecstatic. "Wonderful work, all of you. The people of the Free Worlds will be thanking you for generations." Tomek orders the members of the occupation fleet to sweep the spaceport, freeing any slaves they find and arresting any known criminals and warlords. "We can't possibly take in every criminal here, but if you find someone with a big name, we need to take this opportunity to arrest them."`
			`	After Tomek is done giving orders and celebrating, he approaches you and gives your hand a firm shake. "Thank you for listening to reason, Captain <last>. I know I asked a lot of you when I asked you to directly disobey Senate orders."`

			`	Tomek smiles. "Now we do what we can to rout the criminals and warlords out of this place while we have the advantage. The more damage we can do to them, the less innocent people within the Free Worlds will be hurt by piracy in the future. I've already ordered the men to sweep the spaceport, and we'll be leaving a fleet stationed here for some time to keep the peace. In time we may need to pull back to focus on the Navy again, but for now Greenrock is ours."`
			`	"What about the Senate?" you ask. "We'll certainly be in trouble for this."`

			`	"No good deed goes unpunished, I suppose," Tomek says. "Despite the great opportunity we've created for the Free Worlds, I have no doubt that the Senate will not be happy with the actions we took here. Should they attempt to punish us, let me take full responsibility for what was done here. They need me, so my punishment will not be too severe, and any punishment that is placed upon you should hopefully be minor by comparison. If asked, you were simply following the orders of a superior."`
			`	Just then, you hear another ship coming in for a landing. You both look up to see a Falcon landing in the spaceport: Alondo's Falcon that you were supposed to escort to Thule. Tomek has a somber look on his face. "Let me speak with them first," he says to you. "Meet with us in the spaceport later. Hopefully I'll have smoothed things over by then."`

			`	"You're not seeing the bigger picture," Tomek responds. "Yes, we will need to spend resources keeping Greenrock under control, but we're already spending copious amounts of resources defending our planets, systems, and freighters from pirates as is. If we have Greenrock under our control and the other pirate worlds become afraid to act against us then that is one concentrated place that we need to focus on as opposed to being spread thin across our territory. In the end I imagine this will be a net positive for us."`

			`	Before anyone can continue arguing, JJ rushes into the tent. "Sorry to interrupt, but this little spat is going to need to wait. I just got word that our sensors on Hope have detected increased Naval fleet movements. It seems like they're getting ready for an assault."`
			`	"Have they entered our space?" Alondo asks.`
			`	"No, not yet. Not even a single scout," says JJ.`
			`	"Leave a small fleet here to maintain our occupation, but move the rest of our available forces to <system>," Tomek says, taking charge of the situation. "Recall the eastern patrols. They might arrive late to any battle, but they can at least act as reinforcements if necessary."`
			`	"You're in no position to be giving orders," Freya says, looking disgusted at Tomek. "You and <first> should both be placed under arrest for disobeying the Senate."`
			`	"No," JJ says. "At least not yet. If the Navy is about to attack then we need everyone we can get. We'll resolve this matter once we have the time.

Move our forces to <system> and recall any patrols."`
			`	With that, JJ leaves the tent, hurrying off to a ship. Alondo too leaves without a word. As Freya begins to leave, she turns back to you and Tomek. "I'm very disappointed in you. Both of you." She exits the tent, leaving you and Tomek alone.`
			`	"You should get going," Tomek says solemnly. "And don't get yourself killed in this battle just because of this little mess here. As disappointed as they might be, you still have a part to play.

			`	You lead them into your ship, where Freya explains, "Soon after you left for Thule, Tomek took off on his own and raised a fleet for an attack on Greenrock. He thought the Senate's plan of making a deal with the pirate worlds was too cowardly, and that we needed a show of strength instead. Surprisingly, his stunt succeeded; Greenrock is now nominally under Free Worlds control."`

Word of this has spread quickly. Thule is already second guessing their deal with us, and if Thule has heard of this then there's no doubt in my mind that the Republic has as well."`

			`	"Have they entered our space?" JJ asks.`
			`	"No, not yet. Not even a single scout," says Alondo.`
			`	"We should head to <planet> before deciding our next move," says Freya.`
			`	"About that," says Alondo. "It seems like Tomek is way ahead of us. The news that Tomek is under arrest by the Senate didn't spread quickly enough, and an officer gave him the news about the sensors. He argued that since his position in the Council hasn't yet been revoked, he still has the power to command the militia, and he already ordered all available forces to <system>, including recalling our patrols in the eastern Dirt Belt. The officers who were detaining him reluctantly agreed, given the situation, and released him."`

			`	"I'm not here to discuss the past, Commander," JJ responds. "I'm here to prevent more bloodshed in this pointless war."`
			`	"As am I, Soleau, as am I. Although I might ask, were the lives lost in your attacks on Geminus and Martini pointless, or were those necessary losses."`
			`	"The Free Worlds is not responsible for those bombings," says JJ, sounding somewhat shaken. "We maintain our innocence, and were seeking to uncover who was responsible before the Republic ordered the Navy to take Kornephoros from us."`

			`	"So did you only come here to insult me and the Free Worlds or are you here to discuss peace as I asked?" JJ says, cutting Hines off. "As I said, I'm here to prevent more bloodshed. The deaths of those on Geminus and Martini as well as those in Kornephoros and Sabik were enough already. Continued bloodshed will not satisfy either side in this war."`
			`	"Continued bloodshed like what occurred on Greenrock only days ago?" Hines quips. "I'm sure you are aware that the Navy cannot bring its full force upon the 'Free Worlds.' We have borders to patrol and piracy to tend to. You, on the other hand, have just shattered the biggest hub of piracy in the region, and I have no doubt that this has freed up many resources. It would appear to me that you yourselves are consolidating your forces for an offensive and further bloodshed despite your insistence to the opposite."`
			`	"The actions that were taken on Greenrock were unsanctioned by the Free Worlds Senate or Council," JJ responds. "It was the result of rogue elements that have been taken care of."`
			`	"Rogue elements within your ranks? You certainly have a history of those if it was a rogue element within your insurgency that committed the terrorist acts that took the lives of thousands of Republic citizens. At least, I presume it was a rogue element, as I've never known the venerable Jean-Jacques Soleau to be a liar, so I certainly believe you when you tell me that your 'Free Worlds' wouldn't do that.

			`	Some of the militia watching begin to reach for their weapons or move away as some Navy soldiers step forward, but JJ raises his hand to motion them to stop. The militia notice and hold their ground, as do the Navy soldiers. "Where is the Navy honor that we've all heard so much about?" JJ shouts loud enough for everyone watching to hear. "We come here with open arms asking for peace talks and you move to arrest us?" You hear jeers coming from some of the civilians watching.`
			`	Hines turns up his nose. "This is undoubtedly Republic territory you're standing on, Soleau, and therefore we have every right to arrest you."`
			`	"I think your men disagree," JJ remarks. All of the Navy personnel have either remained in or returned to formation. "Remember that I myself was a part of the Navy once. A Navy that each and every one of your honored men surely remember, either because they lived it or because they grew up revering it. But a Navy that I left because of those like you. I'm sorry to disappoint you, but if we can't negotiate peace talks then we'll be leaving. I pray that you'll be wise enough to see the error in your ways and let us go." JJ stands up and begins walking off, leaving Hines to sulk in his chair.`
