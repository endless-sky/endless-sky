	description "The seeming reverence the Korath have for fire appears embodied in this weapon. This pair of Fire-Lances mounted together in a turret do not merely create twin lances of fire: Rather, they begin to form a gestalt - a single, longer, hotter, and almost hypnotic column of fire."
	description "This turret has been modified to sit mostly outside of the ship, meaning it uses less outfit space, but at the expense of some efficiency and stability."
