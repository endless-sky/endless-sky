If this were a human world, you would estimate its population at over a billion. You follow one of the Pug ships that is landing, and discover a large spaceport where a surprising number of human merchant ships are parked, in addition to the aliens.`

The Pug are oddly proportioned, with long arms and legs but short, barrel-shaped torsos and large heads, and although they only have two legs, their gait is vaguely insectoid.

All that we ask in return is a portion of the goods your worlds produce, to help offset the cost of watching over and protecting so many human worlds. And after some time, we will again allow human beings autonomous control of certain parts of your territory, when you show yourselves capable of living peacefully."`
			`	"By 'spreading peace,' do you mean occupying more systems?" you ask.`

"Those of your worlds and your people who have shown themselves unable to live peacefully, we must govern, to teach them peace.

Flying low, you locate a clearing just big enough for the <ship>, not too far from where the Alphas landed. You do a big loop, flying fast near the tops of the tallest trees in hopes of confusing any watchers, then dip below the canopy to your clearing. There's no one there. The sounds are only the birds taking off, and the wind in the trees.`

	`	Stepping off your ship, you pull out the tracker. Apparently with the modifications, it can point you toward the signal's origin on land too: there's a weak trace coming from the south-east. You set out alone into the jungle. Any crew you have remain on your ship to protect it, and keep it ready for your return.`
	choice
		`	(head toward the Alpha ship)`
	`	The jungle floor is mostly brown and open, cleared by the many animals that pass through. Quietly, you make your way round the trunks, pausing behind bushes from time to time to listen. As you get closer, you see patrols, and make a wide arc, keeping an eye on your tracker, creeping along ditches and round the back of small cliffs, until the Romeo comes into view. It's on the edge of a huge, but low, bunker, likely the top of a building going deep underground. The tracker still points to the ship, but there's no way of getting to it unseen, so you look for an entrance to the bunker.`
	`	To one side, there's an unguarded door. You try it, and find you can enter unnoticed. Inside, the hallway opens to a wide room, and there, tied up, are the four women you've been pursuing! Green-skinned men stand around, and two are arguing over the small number of prisoners brought. You reach for your sidearm, but it won't get you far; you'd just die with no result.`
	choice
		`	(wait)`
	`	Crouching low, you wait for the argument to finish, and watch as one of the soldiers leads the women near to you, and through another door out of sight. From the shadows, you catch the eye of one of the women, and her face lights up: the fear vanishes, and she walks with confidence. Luckily, the Alphas don't seem to have noticed.`
	`	When all is quiet, you creep round the wall, and find the door. It opens onto a big, sterile room full of scientific gadgets, and rows of what look like hospital beds. The women are by themselves, sitting on beds at the back. Suddenly there's a clamour, and a shout of, "Hey! Wha-"`
	`	You draw your gun, and fire: not at the Alpha, but at the medical instruments. Bang! Bang! Crash!- glass goes flying, pressurised air spurts out, machines crumple; and you're thrown to the floor by powerful arms from behind, as your magazine empties its last shot. Your last vision is of an evil, green face, as your head is pulled round to see, or be seen, and a fist lands on it.`
	choice
		`	(wake up)`
	`	You awake in a cold, stone room, on a cold, stone bench, but the warm faces of four young women watching over you.`
	`	"You're awake!" says one. "Thank God you're okay," says another.`
	`	"I... yeah, I'm okay," you say, stretching your sore back. "Where are we?"`
	`	"When you shot out those machines, the green men couldn't do whatever they had planned, and got really angry." The voice and face are unmistakeable, and belong to Vicky, Nikki's twin. "They took us here and," she points to some gruel in a dish on the floor, "gave us food. They need us healthy for whatever experiment it is they're doing. But how did you get here?"`
	`	"I've been chasing you ever since the abduction," you say. "From system to system, from ship to ship."`
	`	"And Nikki?" she asks.`
	`	"Safe, heading back to your grandma."`
	`	"Thank you, Captain."`
	`	"And now we have to get you out of here." You don't like to tell them what the Alphas were planning to do with their equipment.`
	choice
		`	(escape)`
	`	But there's no escape. The only door is firmly locked. Minutes roll into hours. Hours roll into days. Food is supplied in plenty, and chamber pots, for the necessities. From the guards' chatter, you pick up hints that the machinery you broke is being repaired, and you're all being kept until it's ready. Whether that includes you, you're not quite sure.`
	`	And after many days have passed, and you've quite lost count, there's a strange silence through the bunker - not that you could hear much anyway, through the thick stone walls. And then a dull "boom". And a "boom, boom". As they get closer, thuds and booms give way to gunfire and excited shouting. Still, the door is locked, though the room shakes with the explosions. Footsteps clatter down the hallway, and a man looks in, with a gun: A man! A man with brown, not green, skin.`
	`	"Who are you!" the man asks.`
	`	"We were captured by the Alphas," one of the women says. "And Captain <first> here rescued us."`
	`	"Well you didn't do a very good job of it, did you?" He looks at you with a grin. "Come on, lets get you all out of here."`
	`	He leads you out, soon joined by twenty other Navy soldiers, to a massive Cruiser parked by your own ship. Your crew must have fled long ago to the spaceport, or else been captured. You hope they're okay.`
		goto navy
	
	label pugstaff
	`	Stepping off your ship, you take one of the staves the alien Pug gave you. Your crew, if you have any, stay behind to watch the ship and keep it ready: while you creep off into the jungle.`
	choice
		`	(head toward the Alpha ship)`
	`	You know the rough direction of where the Alphas landed, so you walk that way, gripping your staff tightly and hoping you'll know how to use it when the time comes. The jungle floor is mostly brown and open, cleared by the many animals that pass through. It's easy going, but doesn't provide much cover, and after a while your way is blocked by a patrol, while you crouch out of sight behind a small cliff.`
	`	Gripping your staff with one hand, you throw a rock and cough. At the last moment, you realise your folly: the Alphas could come from either side of this cliff - and they do! But as you swing the staff right and left, light leaps out of the end and catches each Alpha before he can shoot. The two supersoldiers drop their guns, gaze off into the middle distance, and start twirling off a drunken dance around the trees. You can almost see the stars circling their heads.`
	`	Pressing on, you get to a clearing where the Romeo is parked in front of a huge, low, bunker, likely the top of a building going deep underground. The party are probably no longer on the ship, so you creep toward the main entrance to the bunker, then duck inside a side door you find.`
	choice
		`	(carry on)`
	`	Inside, the hallway opens on a wide room, with green-skinned men here and there, and two arguing over the small number of prisoners brought: the four women you're here for! Checking around, from the shadows, you count: one, two, three... five... eight Alphas, but one by one they go their separate ways, until just two escort the women to a door on your side of the room.`
	`	The moment they're out of sight, you burst from the shadowed hallway, as silently as you can, and swing your 'happy stick' at the guards. They tumble through the door, into a sterile room full of strange gadgets, and you grab the women and dash for the exit. "I'm <first> <last>. I'm here to rescue you," you whisper, before they have any chance to comment on your stature.`
	choice
		`	(escape)`
	`	Back up the hallway you came by, and out the unguarded door - which is now guarded - and not again, as your staff moves and another Alpha waddles off in a trance. The five of you run for the trees, with a single shot behind you that, luckily, misses its mark. You make for a boulder, breathe, then set off back to the ship.`
	`	But there's no way through. Not with the patrols on the alert. Besides, if you got there, they'd probably blow it out of the sky with anti-air guns.`
	`	"Captain, thank you." One of the girls takes your hand. "We'll be okay, I'm sure we will. Now that you've rescued us."`
	`	Continuing wherever you can stay out of sight, you find a cave, and hide inside. Minutes turn to hours, no one comes, and you get hungry.`
	`	"Captain <last>. I'm Vicky. These are Emily, Asmita and Christina. Did you come for us, or have you another errand you must get to?" The speaker is unmistakeable as Nikki's twin.`
	`	"I came for you," you say. "I've been following you since the abduction, from system to system, from ship to ship. We rescued some of your group; it's just the four of you left."`
	`	"And Nikki?"`
	`	"Safe, heading back to your grandma."`
	`	"Thank you, Captain."`
	`	"What will we do now?" says another of the women.`
	choice
		`	(hide out)`
	`	There's not much to do. Alphas are everywhere, and as the search dies down, there's still no safe way back to your ship, if you could find it again. Under darkness, you creep back to the bunker alone, and with judicious use of the 'happy stick' you find your way to a sort of pantry, and return with armfuls of food. Each night, you do the same, also getting clothing for blankets and bedding where you can. Each night rolls on, and still there seems no chance of escape. You determine that soon, if there's no new opportunity, you'll have to chance it and try to get these women out without being caught.`
	`	Two mornings later, in the early dawn, you gather the group. "Our chances are best in the low light. The guards aren't as active. Come on." You walk a few hours, creeping from trench to trench, hoping to find your ship before an Alpha, and before you're totally lost. A dark shadow passes overhead with the rumble of huge engines, then great explosions boom far behind you. Flashes escape above the trees, and you turn around. Navy ships are flying overhead! There, one dips beneath the trees. There, another soars low to scout. You follow the patterns of scouting gunboats, and soon enough find yourself back at your own ship, in the clearing where you landed. The crew must have fled long ago to the spaceport, or been captured. You hope they're okay.`
	`	But beside your ship is a massive Navy Cruiser. Rasing your hands to say, "don't shoot," and trying not to squeal along with your rescu-ees, you run into the clearing to be greeted by a dozen Navy soldiers.`

			`	"Of course," Arnold says, "hot-trotting it around the galaxy must keep you pretty tired." He makes a call, and a few minutes later someone comes in with a hot, deliciously-smelling cup of coffee. "My upstairs neighbours," Arnold explains. "They're always good to help when someone comes round with a strange request."`

			`	You accept a cup, and hold it under your nose a few moments while it cools. The smell is quite indescribable, but neither strong, nor repulsive.`

			`	Once you've sat down, on a similarly-luxurious armchair opposite Arnold's, he gets talking. "How is life as a galaxy-spanning adventure-captain these days? Do you get to relax, now you're not chasing little green men? And I hear Korban finally wrote up his last rites, and retired to CEO's Valhalla. The new guy, they say, receives secret messages from unknown women telling him how to run the company. Your guess is as good as mine!" he winks.`
			`	As you chat, and reminisce about your adventures, your mind turns to his condition, and how he made that one, bold, journey to Korban's office with you, wrapped in his technologically-advanced wheelchair. Nobody ever told you what it actually is, that keeps him chair-bound in his house. Do you want to ask him?`
			choice
				`	(ask him about it)`
					goto leg
				`	(ignore it)`
			`	You continue talking for a while, until you remember you have to top up your parking meter, or the spaceport will fine you. Saying your farewells, you wander back: with a last word to Arnold: that if he ever needs you again, to save the lives of the innocent and downtrodden... you'll be there.`

			`	"Now that things have quietened down a bit, and we're not under threat from aliens and Alphas," you ask, "have you thought about seeing if other doctors could cure your... difficulty?"`
			`	"Oh, this?" he taps his leg with his teacup. "Ha, I used to adventure round the galaxy. Do you remember that chick with the longbow? You know she actually uses that thing?"`
			`	"Vividly," you say. "I saw her make her mark on an Achilles we were chasing, one of the Extremists trying to run away."`
			`	"When I first met her she... rather took the wrong idea about me. Thought I was the wrong sort of chap, on the wrong sort of team - from a hundred metres across a field." Arnold grins. "I tell people it's a rare, neurological condition, can't leave the house and all-" He pulls up his trouser leg, and you see a large scar on the side of his right knee. "-Truth is, it just bloody hurts to walk on."`
			`	You swap more stories of adventures, and promise him if he ever needs your help again, rescuing the innocent and downtrodden, you'll be there. As you leave, you remark to yourself: Aliens & Alphas. Sounds like a good title for a comic book about a role-playing game. Perhaps you'll try making it sometime.`
