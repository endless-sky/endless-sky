	`	"That's good to hear," Captain <captain> says with a smile. "But be warned that mining isn't as easy as one might think. Especially without an asteroid scanner, mining can be just as much a test of your piloting skills as combat.`
	`	"The first challenge," <they> continues, "will be finding which asteroids are valuable. The worthless asteroids are either brown and smooth or gray and spiky with no apparent orbit. It doesn't matter how long you shoot them, they won't be destroyed. Valuable asteroids will always orbit the star and have a range of colors and surface textures. If you're not sure which are which and you don't have an asteroid scanner to tell you, keep a look out for other miners to see what they're firing at.`
	`	"Generally speaking, the more valuable minerals are tougher to mine, either because they're harder to break apart, or they're less common and in more dangerous regions of the galaxy. Silicon breaks up quickly; you'll fill your hold in a hurry and the stuff is everywhere. Platinum or gold asteroids are more work; they're not as common in areas where the Navy watches your back, but you make several times the number of credits for the effort.`

		`	"That was great!"`
	`	James nods and says, "Chasing asteroids can be a challenge, but when you're starting off, mining can be a fast way to build cash for your next ship. It's also a great way to explore the galaxy. Jobs always follow the trade routes and settled areas. Mining makes it profitable to explore the nooks and crannies of the hyperlanes. If the place you end up landing has an economy, they'll buy the minerals in your hold. Mainly though, it's about how you like to spend your time. Some captains like managing a trading fleet while others like to strike out on their own.`
	`	"Mining can be complex compared to running jobs or trading commodities. I learned that first hand after pirates disabled my ship when I was starting out and I worked aboard a mining ship while it was being repaired. Now that was a while back so I might be a little rusty, but I could try at answering any other questions you might have about mining."`

If you want to optimize your mining operations, however, you'll want a Mining Laser. Not only does it cut through asteroids faster, it's also more precise and preserves more minerals when the asteroid breaks apart. Some miners like to have a bit of combat flexibility by mining with Heavy Lasers, however.`
	`	"Aside from lasers, the most valuable tool is an asteroid scanner. They're expensive, but they connect into your navigation and targeting systems to point you towards minable asteroids. You can also set them to find the most valuable asteroids, which increases your profitability per run. After that, a tactical scanner will tell you how far away the asteroid is and show how much damage you're doing. An afterburner is good for chasing down fast moving asteroids or getting away from pirates without leaving the system. A ramscoop will let you refuel while mining, extend your exploration range, and allow you to be ready for a quick escape."`

			`<origin> is the same as it's always been. Homeless men wrapped in old army blankets beg money from well-dressed businessmen.
