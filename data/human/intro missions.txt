And two Heavy Rocket hits could nearly disable you. Also, if it has anti-missile turrets, you can't count on hanging back and bombarding it with missiles from long distances, or at least not with weapons that can fit in a Sparrow. So, don't risk it. It's like rock paper scissors; recognize what your enemy's strengths and weaknesses are, as well as your own."`

			`You find James waiting for you just outside the spaceport bar. Against the steady patter of micrometeorites against the roof he tells you, "Working here on <origin> is one of the few jobs in the galaxy more dangerous than fighting pirates. And worse, because if a big meteorite decides to strike this station, there's basically nothing the miners can do about it except hope they see it coming." He turns to you with a grin. "But nonetheless, I think you might be interested in this idea."`
			`	James leads you down the side of the bar to a booth where a man with a half-eaten hamburger and a plate of fries is sitting, busily examining a star map of the local sector. He notices your arrival and stands up to greet you. "<first>, this is Captain Marshall," James says as you shake his hand. "I told him about your new ship and how it'd be a good idea for you to get a taste of asteroid mining. He mines in this part of space and says there's a good system nearby if you're willing to give it a try."`

			`	"That's good to hear," Captain Marshall says with a smile. "But be warned that mining isn't as easy as one might think. Especially without an asteroid scanner, mining can be just as much a test of your piloting skills as combat.`
			`	"The first challenge," he continues, "will be finding which asteroids are valuable. The worthless asteroids are either brown and smooth or gray and spiky with no apparent orbit. It doesn't matter how long you shoot them, they won't be destroyed. Valuable asteroids will always orbit the star and have a range of colors and surface textures. If you're not sure which are which and you don't have an asteroid scanner to tell you, keep a look out for other miners to see what they're firing at.`
			`	"Generally speaking, the more valuable minerals are tougher to mine, either because they're harder to break apart, or they're less common and in more dangerous regions of the galaxy. Silicon breaks up quickly; you'll fill your hold in a hurry and the stuff is everywhere. Platinum or gold asteroids are more work; they're not as common in areas where the Navy watches your back, but you make several times the number of credits for the effort.`
			`	"I could go on, but I think you get the picture."`
			`	You and James chat with Marshall a while longer, and he suggests trying your hand at mining in <system>. "It's a great place. You could throw a dart in that system and half the time you'd hit an asteroid worth at least something, and I've never been bothered by pirates while I've been there."`

			`	James nods and says, "Chasing asteroids can be a challenge, but when you're starting off, mining can be a fast way to build cash for your next ship. It's also a great way to explore the galaxy. Jobs always follow the trade routes and settled areas. Mining makes it profitable to explore the nooks and crannies of the hyperlanes. If the place you end up landing has an economy, they'll buy the minerals in your hold. Mainly though, it's about how you like to spend your time. Some captains like managing a trading fleet while others like to strike out on their own.`
			`	"Mining can be complex compared to running jobs or trading commodities. I learned that first hand after pirates disabled my ship when I was starting out and I worked aboard a mining ship while it was being repaired. Now that was a while back so I might be a little rusty, but I could try at answering any other questions you might have about mining."`

			`	"Well, you need a weapon that does hull damage," James says. "A Beam Laser will get the job done, but it will take a while. If you want to optimize your mining operations, however, you'll want a Mining Laser. Not only does it cut through asteroids faster, it's also more precise and preserves more minerals when the asteroid breaks apart. Some miners like to have a bit of combat flexibility by mining with Heavy Lasers, however.`
			`	"Aside from lasers, the most valuable tool is an asteroid scanner. They're expensive, but they connect into your navigation and targeting systems to point you towards minable asteroids. You can also set them to find the most valuable asteroids, which increases your profitability per run. After that, a tactical scanner will tell you how far away the asteroid is and show how much damage you're doing. An afterburner is good for chasing down fast moving asteroids or getting away from pirates without leaving the system. A ramscoop will let you refuel while mining, extend your exploration range, and allow you to be ready for a quick escape."`

Do you really need that much power? If you've got an outfitter on the planet where you're mining, do you need a hyperdrive, or even a shield generator? Maybe a cargo expansion would be of more use."
