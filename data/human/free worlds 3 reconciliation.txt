Indeed, during some of the darkest centuries of the space age, the Deep stood out as a beacon of civilization, a place where piracy was not tolerated and all travelers were safe.

When you arrive, there will just happen to be an Oathkeeper patrol passing through the same system. And a merchant convoy from the Deep. With its own set of escorts, of course."`

			`	Alastair seems like the kind of person who seldom admits he is wrong, but your question definitely flusters him. "Okay, okay, I admit, we've been making one bad decision after another ever since... well, since that first bad decision. It just got out of control. We thought the Navy was going to raid us and put us all behind bars. We thought we needed a deterrent. It was stupid. I admit it, okay? Now please, let's just move on.

If you are, we will work together until this threat is dealt with... and once it is dealt with, we will return our attention to bringing every member of the Syndicate who had a hand in those terrorist attacks to justice. That is our best and final offer." You nod in agreement.`
			`	It's clear that Alastair is none too happy about that deal, but he accepts it. "The jump drives are all being kept on Hephaestus," he says.

But the Oracle gave us a way to predict the future, for everything from supply chain management to stock trading to the commodities market."`

A massive recession was coming, an end to the golden days of the Republic. We tried altering the model in every way we could: changing our production, our wages. We even asked the Oracle if dissolving the Syndicate would avert the recession. But its predictions remained the same. Then we learned from our contacts in Parliament about the Southern Defense Pact, and the fear that they were about to declare independence. So we asked the Oracle what would happen if war broke out."`
			`	"You started a war... to save the economy?" says Danforth. He sounds disgusted. "Do you know how many lives have been lost because of your sick greed?"`
			`	Alastair snaps at Danforth. "Do you think we made this decision lightly? Do you know how many lives would have been lost had such a recession actually occurred? The last time the economy fell as hard as the Oracle predicted, humanity entered a dark age where millions died of starvation and billions more suffered from the resulting chaos!`

			`	"We gave the Alphas most of the alien technology we recovered," he says, "but one device, we managed to keep secret from them. We found it in a Korath cargo hold, and it took us a long time to even figure out how to activate it. But when we did, we discovered that it's a cloaking device. It obscures a ship not just from the visible spectrum, but from radar as well, and every other sensor we've tested except for gravitational ones. I'm certain it would hide you from the tracking systems on the nukes."`
			`	Freya says, "But it would only hide one ship. That doesn't sound like it would do much good."`
			`	Alastair says, "They have a limited number of nukes. Our plan was to send a ship in cloaked, have it uncloak long enough to draw their fire, and then cloak to avoid the missiles. Basically, see how many missiles we can get them to spend before the main attack fleet arrives."`

With the Free Worlds having been instrumental in defeating the aliens, and absolved of any guilt in the terrorist attacks, it seems that most people here are ready to see you as a hero rather than a criminal.`
			`	Your meeting with Parliament is long and grueling, as they press you and Freya for every detail you can give them about the enigmatic Pug and their apparent motivation in invading human space. The questions about the Syndicate are equally hard to answer. But at the end of the session, one of the members of Parliament informs you that they have authorized an official commendation for you, along with a reward of five million credits "to cover any of your expenses from fighting the aliens."`

			`	"Well, it looks like the Council is all together again," says JJ, "for the last time, as it so happens. Now that the war has ended, and the Pug have been defeated, the Senate has voted to dissolve the Council, leaving us free to return to civilian life. However, they've also agreed to pay you, <first>, a reduced salary in gratitude of your service. So, what do you think you will do next?"`
