			`You ask around and find the room where the mysterious board meeting will take place, and find it's about to start. Going in, you sit down to the table, where it turns out this company within the Syndicate has a consignment of high-grade weapons and are looking for a buyer.  Discussion quickly becomes animated about where to find the right sort of buyer, what price to offer at, how to avoid worrying the Navy, and so on. Eventually a shout comes from a secretary in the adjacent room,`

Why, he's flying around saying piratey things like, 'Arr,' 'Y'all,' and 'Ye be looking good in them leggings, matey.' That pirate flying around there is a *good* pirate!"`

But you're young, you're young, when you're young you think you can change the whole world overnight, even selling weapons - I know, I've been young myself. Take it from your old mentor, you've just got to learn to take the world as it is."`
