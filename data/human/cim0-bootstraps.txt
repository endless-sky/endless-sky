	`You arranged ahead of time for the company to buy you a spaceship, as a 'bonus'. Company troubles have mounted, workers were laid off, and assets pledged as securities: and in the last few months executive functions and retreats have dwindled almost to nothing, while you worked so hard in time of crisis. You've had to make do with very austere compensation - so surely they can afford you this little bonus.`
	`	A simple pilot's Star Barge would never do for you, besides you're not used to the rough living of ordinary space life - in fact you've never been off-world before! But your secretary's uncle, himself a manager at a shipbuilding company, has promised you the best, a Star Queen.`
	`	You bought it with company money, so it won't add to your own, not-inconsiderable debts, but it's in your name, so when your company goes bust, you keep the ship. Now at last you sign your name into the ship's records:`
	name
	`	You walk over to the hangar to see your new ship. Finally, you'll be free from this world, free from the rules of 'superiors', free from the dregs of society, free to roam the stars of the endless sky.`

	`	When you get on board your beautiful ship, the Whitewashed Princess, you are met by a man a bit too well dressed for your comfort, and for a moment you wonder if there's been a terrible mistake and your company thinks it owns your new ship. He greets you in a perfectly expressionless voice, from a perfectly expressionless face.`
	`	"Welcome aboard the Whitewashed Princess, Captian <last>. I am your co-pilot, and as your second-in-command I can also offer you some advice as you you start your new flying career."`
	choice
		`	"Thank you. If you have good ideas, not dimwitted ones about 'downsizing executive bonuses,' then I'm all ears."`
		`	"Just remember that I'm the captain, and I'll let you stay on my ship."`
		`	"Get off my ship, peasant!"`
			goto solo

	`	You walk ahead of him to the bridge, sit down in the captain's seat, and start playing with the controls.`
	`	"Well then," you say, "what advice do you have for us. Where should we fly first? To Geminus, to join the Navy? Stormhold and blast pirates out of the sky? Buzz through Sol and show off our sleek new craft to the poor masses of earth? Explore the darkest corners of the South? Or just ferry around the goods of ungrateful syndicate bosses for extortionate prices?" Apparently he is unfazed by your use of the royal 'we' - he certainly wouldn't think you imagined a communal ownership of the Princess.`

	`	"You might want to start by firing whoever bought this ship, it seems they have no experience at all, and bought an overpriced, ill-used vessel from an unscrupulous dealer."`
	`	You hope the red rising to your face doesn't show.`
	`	"This ship can barely fly. The Navy would never accept you in it, it would take forever to explore the South, and if you try to fight pirates they'll blast you into rubble before you can turn to face them. As for showing off your sleek ship to Earth..."`
	`	Your face grows a deeper red.`
	choice
		`	"Stop babbling and say something useful."`
		`	(let him continue)`
	`	"What you want to do first, is outfit her properly. She's a nice enough ship, meaning the hull, just needs some better engines and equipment. First you buy the biggest engines you can fit--`
	`	"I don't have money," you say."`
	`	He stares at you for a moment and hesitates. "Okay, take out a loan. You'll make it up in no time with this big ship."`
	choice
		`	"Um, sure, I'll just do that, no problem."`
			goto smallchange

	label smallchange
	`	You finger the credit chips in your pocket. These were for luxuries, enjoying yourself wherever you land to take a break from the stars. Well, the bank would probably just take them off you tomorrow anyway.`
	`	"Okay, say I have some small change. What does the Princess need to get her shipshape?`
	`	"In the long run, you'll need bigger engines, more power and better defence. A scram drive would help you evade pirates if you can't run away or fight them. And luxury accommodations would help you make more money from rich passengers, with all that space.`
	`	You don't really like the idea of letting more rabble onto your ship, but you let him continue.`
	`	"For now, I'd recommend buying larger engines, perhaps the X2X00 series, and the cheapest fuel cell so you don't die if your batteries run out before landing. If you sell the tiny engines you currently have, you could maybe afford a reverse thruster to make lining up for jumps faster. If you can afford a cargo scanner too you might get some corporate espionage jobs."`
	`	You sigh and watch your dreams of flying free and living the high life fade out of your grasp. "Don't you have any really useful advice? Like some cousin of yours wants photos of a ship for his galaxy-wide bestselling magazine, or your sisters need a tour of the best clubs in the Paradise Worlds?"`
	choice
		`	(next)`
