			`	Before the admiral can work himself up further, Paris intercedes with the rest of the story. "The cubes that Deep Security had you position on multiple worlds were surveillance devices - sensor cubes, as we call them - designed to track Beelzebub's ship and notify us when the ship was located. It can be presumed that Beelzebub now has access to these cubes and has undoubtedly converted them to work in his favor.

With both Navy and Deep technology now in the hands of this criminal, every available ship will be required to take him down. Given this, we are now hoping that you would be willing to assist us in trapping Beelzebub. The six of your fleets combined would certainly make up for anything that the Navy has lost in the attack."`

The Mule immediately unloads what looks to be at least four dozen armed soldiers who quickly surround and breach the hangar.

On a person's 16th birthday they are given a stone to carry with them through their lives. On special, or momentous occasions, they are to carve a few runes into it, a few cherished memories chiseled into hard stone."`

For you to take it all the way to his son, so that he may return it to earth, is right."`
				goto earth

			`	Helm shrugs as he maneuvers the ship into dock. "Wherever makes the most sense at the time a stone is given. If I recall correctly Skaldgar's stone was given to him by his mother, my grandmother, from an old mine Skaldgar had been exploring on the mainland. Even at 16 he loved the earth."`
			label earth
			`	Helm ties up the ship at a makeshift dock and you follow him toward a dour gray building not far away. You realize this entire algae island, as small as it is, must belong to a single individual or family.`
			`	When you arrive at the hardy and sea-stained wooden door, Helm knocks thunderously upon it and calls out, "Thorleif, open up!"`
			`	After a brief wait the door opens ponderously, revealing a large, red-bearded, middle aged man who looks like a younger and much healthier Skaldgar. You realize that you must be standing before the man's son. A wide and open grin forms on his face when he sees Helm, and he gives the man a warm embrace. "Ah cousin!

"I realize you have traveled far and would not be able to get back to the mainland before night. So you may stay in the guest quarters, and leave first thing in the morning.

But I know that every time I met him he clearly regretted whatever happened, and constantly spoke of his mistakes. He's gone now, mistakes and all, and this stone... I don't think it represents forgiveness, but maybe acceptance of who he was, and that now he is gone."`
			`	Thorleif turns to you, his face flashing red, and speaks through clenched teeth, "I have no father. I have no memories of such a man, and I will make no effort to remember someone who didn't stick around long enough to know me. Now, go to your rooms and leave me be!"`
			label rooms
			`	You quietly follow Helm to two small, sparsely decorated rooms, clearly intended for guest use. Helm clears his throat, "This may surprise you, but that actually went better than I thought it would."`
			`	Helm then turns his attention to a small window and the darkening horizon beyond it. "Dark clouds are gathering, I fear we may be here longer than a single night."`
			choice
				`	(Head off to bed as the first rains begin to patter against the roof.)`
			`	You awake to the riotous din of hard rain crashing against the building. As Helm predicted, a powerful storm blew in during the night, the floating island besieged by savage weather. By midmorning, the walls are starting to creak as howling forces of nature bash against it unceasingly.`
			`	You hear a door open and struggle to close, followed by the sound of heavy sloshing footsteps. Thorleif, soaked to the bone, stands before you and Helm in the main room. "It's a Fimbulhrithr," Thorleif exclaims, "One of the worst I've yet seen. If we do not act quickly it could well flatten everything on this isle. Will you help me?"`

				`	(Offer to help Thorleif.)`
					goto help
				`	"No, I've done enough for this family already. Especially for free!"`
			`	Thorleif growls, "Knew better than to trust a friend of that useless old man. I gave you a place to sleep, and now you won't lift a hand to save it? I should have expected no less!" Thorleif and Helm hurry off to tend to the island during the storm, leaving you idle inside.`
			`	Thorleif and Helm heroically use the island's metal rudder and rudimentary engine to steer it away from the storm and to calmer, safer seas. However, with only the two of them many of the out-buildings are destroyed, along with a few of the small watercraft Thorleif used to fish and work on.`
			`	You get the impression that this is an expensive and major loss for Thorleif. The moment the winds are calm, he demands Helm take you back to the mainland and your ship. "This Captain," Thorleif says, his voice oozing with disgust, "is just as lucky as my so-called father. I want him gone."`
			`	For most of the trip back to your ship, Helm says nothing. He has been cool to you ever since you refused to help save the island. Finally, as you are preparing to disembark from his ship, he stops you. "You've done Skaldgar no favors here. I'd appreciate it if we don't see from you again."`
			`	Helm holds up his hand showing off the stone in his palm. "I took it while you were napping. Skaldgar made a mistake with you, and I will at least see the stone properly tended. Goodbye." Helm indicates toward the exit and waits for you to depart before casting off again in his ship.`

			`	Thorleif nods and takes you and Helm outside into the storm, or Fimbulhrithr. Thorleif and Helm work the island's metal rudder and rudimentary engine to steer the island away from the storm, while you are given the task of tying everything down that is liable to fly away.`
			`	With the storm comes unnatural darkness, and the sky is filled with debris and fish and all manner of items that do not belong in it. You hurry as fast as you can, saving as much as possible.`
			`	After hours of hard work, the storm begins to subside, and the sea and sky begin to calm. An exhausted Thorleif and Helm stagger over to you, and Thorleif surveys his small island. "Without your help I would have lost much of what stands intact. It was a lucky thing you came when you did."`
			`	With that, he turns and heads back to the main dwelling, with you and Helm in tired tow.`

			`	The idea of Elves, or Alfar as they call them, intrigues you, and you ask what they know of them.`

			`	Thorleif shrugs. "This may be true, and good at that, but others think the Alfar, for all their apparent good works, cannot be trusted. Their minds are unknowable and filled with mischief, and their aims are not ours. This is the belief that our family holds to. They should be respected, but also feared. We must look to each other for support and strength, and trust not in the deeds of strangers."`

			`	You could always use a little extra money, and this trip, while engaging, has certainly not made you any richer, so you ask about hidden treasures. Helm and Thorleif both grin at this and glance at each other knowingly. They launch into tales of the riches of lost civilizations, or forgotten pirate hoards, or even early human kingdoms. It's easy to lose things on a fog-covered ocean world with floating islands, all too easy.`
			`	When they are done regaling you with tales, they mention to you that maybe some other time they'll take you out into the deep ocean and perhaps you'll find what you're looking for. They smile wolfishly at that, and you think they might be putting you on. "Have you ever found treasure out here?" you ask.`
			`	Thorleif shrugs. "Coming here... from Alfheim long ago, our descendants felt that the world itself was the real treasure. We have no need to go chasing dreams in the abyss."`
			label family
			`	As the conversation winds down and the hour grows late Helm excuses himself to bed, for he, like the rest of you, is dog tired after the day's events. You stand too, feeling your own need for sleep.`
			`	"<first>," Thorleif says without looking up from the fire. "I've been thinking. I can never forgive my father for what he did. Leaving me and mom like that. But I can, I think, make peace with it. I can accept the stone." He looks up and smiles, "You brought some luck with you, and a man should never argue with luck."`
			`	He stands up. "We'll talk in the morning."`

				`	(Head to bed for some well deserved sleep.)`
			`	The day is bright and the sky is clear, the storm long forgotten as you prepare your things. Both men meet you in the main room. Thorleif opens up his hand to accept the stone, which you gladly place into it. He smiles and looks it over, tracing his finger along its chiseled runes.`
			`	"Thank you, <first>." You nod, happy to be done with this mission and free to fly the space lanes once more.`
			`	"Just more thing," Thorleif adds with a sly grin. "I'll need a captain willing to ferry me to Alfheim. That's where my family's cairn is located."`
			`	Before you know it, the three of you are on Helm's boat and heading for the spaceport.`
			`	"Alfheim," Thorleif says idly, "you know of it? The name means the home of the Alfar, or elves as you call them. I've never been there, only heard of it. It'll be strange to visit the world of my ancestors."`
			`	Helm stays behind as you and Thorleif load your gear onto your ship.`
			`	You're not sure exactly how you got mixed up into all this, and yet, it all feels right to you. Like you are where you should be, doing what you should do. This adventure may not involve intergalactic wars or the secrets of the ancients, but sometimes it really is just about people. People like Skaldgar and Thorleif and Helm.`

			`The journey to Alfheim was interesting, if uneventful. Thorleif had never been in space before, and every jump left him quite ill. At the same time, however, he found so much wonder in it: seeing the dark void and bright stars with his own eyes; watching the tiny worlds recede into the distance. You could, through his eyes, experience the wild adventure of space anew.`
			`	Throughout the trip, he told you stories of his family: They were called the Hlewagast and originally settled as some of the first colonists on Alfheim in the early history of The Deep. How they had been explorers and adventurers before taking land here to settle down on and work. How his great grandparents had decided to leave Alfheim, dismayed by the rampant pillaging of resources and looking once more for adventure, and how they had come to Norn. Seeking the waves, and the storms, and the solitude.`
			`	Through all of this, you got a better feel for Thorleif, Skaldgard and his people, and are almost sorry when your ship approaches Alfheim.`
			`	On landing, you are surprised by how much Alfheim reminds you of Helheim. Though the environment and ecology of the worlds are remarkably different, both are primarily used for resource extraction, and thus filled with boomtown employees and migrants looking for work, chasing dreams, and trying to make their way in the world.`
			`	Thorleif points to the spaceport. "Let's see if we can find a guide in there. There's a village we'll need to find, assuming it even exists anymore and hasn't been abandoned or destroyed to make room for a new oil rig."`

			`Thorleif is clearly uncomfortable being in a place so jam-packed with people. You help him keep his bearings and work your way to a young woman managing a visitor kiosk in the Spaceport.`
			`	The woman looks up with a tired, practiced smile. "Welcome to Alfheim. Are you looking for work, or looking for a specific rig site? Please be aware that proof of employment is required before I can give you any details on company rigs."`
			`	Thorleif shakes his head. "Lady, no. We're not... anyone's employees, nor do we need work here. I am looking for a village, hamlet really, called Grimssalr. It's where my folk come from."`
			`	The woman frowns for a second then seems to break from a trance as real warmth washes over her face. "I am sorry, it's just been so long since I've dealt with people who weren't looking for work. Alfheim, well, it is what it used to be, but only just more so now." She shrugs, "I know of Grimssalr though. I'm actually from Lindsvoll, in the same valley."`

			`	At some point you feel Thorleif shaking your shoulder. "We're here."`
			choice
				`	(Rise from my seat.)`
			`	The town of Grimssalr is nestled along the foothills of the towering Ettin mountains in western Alfheim. Town is perhaps too generous a word; it is instead more like a couple dozen houses filled with old people long abandoned by their children seeking wealth and adventure elsewhere.`
			`	The woman, who you've learned is named Ragnhild, introduces Thorleif to some of the folks here, and before long they have found ways to connect their ancient genealogies together and everyone is suddenly treated as family. Before you know it, you are eating their meager yet hearty fare, swapping stories of adventures, and listening to legends about the old times.`

			`	You follow Thorleif up a mostly overgrown trail for about half an hour before finally stepping out into a wide open plain. The wind is cool and refreshing, and the grass blows with a steadiness that is somehow reassuring. There is something special and timeless about this meadow.`
			`	You notice over two dozen columns of stone arranged in a circle around a much more massive and impressive structure - a wall cut from some sort of metal you don't recognize. It is covered with filled with letters and images that are unfamiliar to you.`
			`	"That is an Elf-Stone. It is why we built our Family-Cairns here. Such stones can be found on most worlds in The Deep. Indestructible, and left by the Alfar for some unknowable reason. Some, like this one, have been mostly forgotten. Others though, are important places of celebration and even worship."`
			`	He points at a smallish cairn next to the Elf-Stone. "This, though, is what we're here for."`
			`	You eye the worn and weather-beaten cairn with a faded name plate that has 'Hlewagast' carved into its base.`
			`	Thorleif approaches the cairn.`

			`	Thorleif sniffs, takes a moment to write something down he saw on the stone, and then walks forward and places it upon the cairn, at home now with hundreds of other stones each with their own handful of memories.`
			`	"He had not so many good memories, I think," Thorleif said quietly. "I realize now that mine too are quite few. Perhaps that, if nothing else, is a lesson he can teach me. For that, I thank you, father."`
			`	With that, Thorleif turns from the cairn with teary eyes. "It is done. Let us head back."`

				`	(Follow Thorleif back to the village.)`

			`	You enjoy yourself well into the evening before Thorleif approaches you. It's time to head back.`
			`	"This place," Thorleif begins, "this world, it feels like it has forgotten its soul. Industry and greed have taken hold, and the old happy places like Grimssalr are dying. It is good my family left here all those years ago. Norn is, and has been, a good place to be."`
			`	Thorleif then nods to Ragnhild. "Which is also why my very new and very dear friend Ragnhild has decided to join us on the return trip to Norn." You look to Ragnhild but somehow you can't feel that you're surprised at the news.`

			`The trip back to Norn was restful.`
			`	You spent most of it listening to Ragnhild tell the old stories and legends of Alfheim that she had learned as a child.`
			`	Stories about alien trees whispering dark secrets, of oil barons destroying sacred sites and being cursed by alien artifacts they were too blinded by greed to see, and even tales of the elves and miracles of the Elf-Stones.`
			`	Again, as before, you're almost sad when you make it back to Norn and the time for telling stories has ended, and the time for saying goodbye has begun.`
			`	Thorleif wraps you in a bear hug. "I thank you for all you have done, <first>. I was so wound up in my own anger and bitterness I couldn't see anything beyond my own pain. But now, I feel like I can live again. Trust that our meeting has been etched into my own stone. I hope someday you come back and visit us. To remember us small folk on a small world so far from places of power and grand events. Remember you'll always have a home here."`
			`	With that Thorleif and Ragnhild make their way off your ship. Thorleif only takes a few steps out into the quiet Norn spaceport before stopping suddenly and turning back towards you.`
			`	"I almost forgot. The old man, Skaldgar, well, he had quite a bit of money saved up. I don't think he hardly spent anything on himself. Anyways, I've decided to split the inheritance with you. After taxes, your half comes out to around 500,000 even."`

"We call her Brunhilda, the Queen of the Ice, a most.. durable vehicle, capable of giving you an authentic ice-explorer experience!"`

Oddly enough, the effect does not clash, but instead gives off an impression of seamless artistry. To the south, there is an open space filled with high-stacked stone cairns. At the center of the space, or holy site, is a giant wall made of an usual gleaming metal and surrounded by eight ornate wooden pillars. The wall, despite being filled with strange letters and images, is dominated by the single image of a giant humanoid. As you stare into the structure, you feel unnaturally chilly.`
			`	"That is Goddess-Stone." The Ondurdis gestures toward the large stone-wall. "This is why we settled here. Most worlds in Deep have stones like this upon them. They go by many names; Elf-Stones, God-Stones, Jotun-Stones, and more. Now, at base of wall, those pillars, they are our Setstokkr. They are holy relics of our folk, and guided us here, to this very wall, long ago. Just as they will guide us once more to our new home. There are eight Setstokkr here, but once there was nine."`
			`	The Ondurdis turns back to you. "You must find the ninth Setstokkr, the missing pillar. It was dropped in space long ago, and we believe based on where it started it could have only found its way to one of two worlds. It either on Windblain in the Regor system, or Asgard in the Naos system." Offering you a small storage device, the Onduris continues, "Setstokkr have... unusual properties. This drive contains information that will allow you to track them. Go to these worlds, see if you can find the Setstokkr, and return to us with news. We are eager to know where Skade will send us."`

On one Setstokkr, you notice that a frequent carving within its entwined animals is similar in shape to the burn on your arm.`

Holding up both hands in a placating gesture, he adds, "And I really am sorry we could not extract you from that avalanche. We don't have the resources allocated to support rescue missions anymore; various services, including emergency ones, are only barely functional. The whole operation on this planet is being shut down, you know. Not enough opportunity to make a profit left here. That's why it will be completely uninhabited within 50 years."`

				`	"You're abandoning an entire planet?"`

There hasn't been a profitable discovery here in generations. It's a money pit. You run a ship, a business, you understand.`
			`	"There is, however, one hiccup." Jakob leans back. "A thorn that has been in our side since our research firm first colonized this world over 600 years ago. Those crazy hill-witches. Sure, early on they had their uses as guides and whatnot. But, they are a cultural dead end, an atavistic blight on our corporate world. You know," he continues with a humorous glint in his eye, "They actually believe that they were brought here during Earth's stone-age by magical space-fairies."`

					goto leaving
				`	"I thought folk tales of elves were common in the Deep. What makes the Skadenga so different from the rest of you?"`
			`	Henrik leans back. "Well, you're not wrong. In fact, there's been studies about whether the Skadenga are truly a traditional reflection of the Deep people or an extreme offshoot of what we used to be. Suffice to say, I believe it's the latter, and most modern Deep historians would agree with me.`
			`	"Here's what really makes them different: our popular folk tales are like the childhood stories you heard of, say, the boogeyman. The Skadenga don't just tell them - they formed a religion out of those stories. If you've spoken with them, I'm sure you can tell that it's quite reminiscent of ancient paganism. Certainly they can practice whatever they want, but we're concerned about some of the usual connotations of paganism. We haven't been able to prove any extreme behavior, but their religion gives us reason to suspect it. If they stay culturally isolated from the rest of the Deep, their religion could progress in ways more... harmful. I'll leave it at that.`
				goto resettle

			`	"The Deep would never forcibly resettle a population. But with your help, we have an opportunity to guide them to a place where they could receive the help they need. We know you recently visited Windblain and Asgard. Sending them to Windblain, a barely inhabited world with no useful public services, would be a huge mistake. These poor wretches would disappear into the uncharted wilds. Asgard, however, has a robust civil service and safety net that would be perfect to help them adapt to our modern culture.`
			`	"This is why I asked the Vice Planetary-Governor to hold this meeting. The Deep needs you to convince these poor, backwards people that they should live on Asgard." Henrik shrugs. "For all we know, you've already decided to tell them Asgard is the best choice, in which case we're really not asking you to do anything you weren't already planning on doing. We will also help facilitate the move by providing transportation. Furthermore, for your support in this delicate matter, we will transfer 850,000 credits to your account upon their arrival in Asgard. Really, everyone wins this way."`

All we need is for you to guide those people to Asgard. If you do that, the Transport Union on Valhalla will have the ships you need. If you don't, well, things might be more difficult for everyone. And remember, we'll pay you in real credits. Not charm bracelets."`
			`	"Lars!" Jakob calls, and the administrator and his two guards promptly enter the room. "Show Captain <last> back to their ship. Our meeting is concluded."`
			`	"Of course, sir," Lars replies.`
			`	The guards grab you and "escort" you off the premises. With that distraction out of the way, it's time to go meet Hjlod at the spaceport.`

			`In the crowded high-atmosphere of Asgard, it is difficult to find any reading that matches that of the exotic Setstokkr material. You do get one anomalous ping from a related material located in the urban center of Helsingor.`
			`	Your ship lands in a regional spaceport that serves Helsingor, and your handheld tracker leads you to the heart of the city, where you discover a massive, winding mall. The tracker leads you inside the mall.`
			`	Once inside, your eyes catch the glint of a vast metallic structure around which the entire mall is built. You can make out unusual pictures and alien letters carved into it. It appears that the shopping mall has been built around Asgard's God-Stone, and that the Stone is being used as an exotic accent wall for the myriad of shops in the structure.`
			choice
				`	(Follow the tracker.)`
			`	For a moment you forget the God-Stone and focus on following the tracker. It leads you to a themed restaurant on the top floor called "The Adventurer's Due." The restaurant is filled with exotic artifacts allegedly taken from all corners of known and unknown space.`
			`	Your tracker hones in on one case. It contains a rune covered box, with patterns that look similar to those used by the Skadenga. The panel above it reads:`
			``
			`	'This box once contained the cure to the Rigellian Plague. It belonged to the renowned explorer, adventurer, and researcher Dr. Henry Forsyth. It was donated by the Forsyth Foundation for Academic Honesty.'`
			``
			`	Disappointed, you head back down to the lower levels of the mall and take a seat at a small in-door park at the base of God-Stone. After a moment, a woman wearing a well-pressed pants suit approaches you.`
			choice
				`	(Offer a non-committal "Hello.")`
				`	(Grin and say, "Hey!")`
				`	(Ignore her.)`
			`	"Hello!" She gives you a professional smile. "It's a beautiful place, isn't it? Not just the mall, but the town of Helsingor itself."`
			`	She sits next to you. "You might not realize it, but homes here are incredibly affordable right now. If you're looking for a new place to live, now is the time." She lowers her voice. "But you'll have to act soon. The Helsingor secret is about to get out, and once it does, prices here will skyrocket!`
			`	"There are three huge prefabricated housing developments that have just completed construction on the edges of town. I could get you an appointment today if you're interested." She hands you a card. "My name is Carla Von Hausen, and I'd be happy to serve as your real-estate agent." She gives you a sharp, practiced smile that does not quite reach her eyes.`
			choice
				`	"Beat it, lady."`
				`	"Thanks, but I am just passing through."`
					goto stars
				`	"My home is among the stars."`
					goto stars
			`	A frown flickers across Carla's face for a brief second before her professional smile reasserts itself. "Trust me, why rent when you can own? Why move a large family to an empty world with poor restaurant selections when you could move them here?"`
			`	She stands and smooths her suit jacket. "When you change your mind, I'll be here." With that, she's gone, and you are free to turn your attention back to the God-Stone.`
				goto elfstone
			label stars
			`	Carla rewards you with a condescending smile. "Ah, darling. You might work in space, but eventually, you'll need a world to call home."`
			`	She stands and smooths her suit jacket. "When you are ready to make the real-estate leap, you know where to find me." Carla winks at you and then strolls off in the crowds of shoppers. Alone, you turn your attention back to the God-Stone.`
			label elfstone
			`	The parts of the God-Stone that are exposed at this level are dull and lusterless. You search for a pattern but can make nothing out due to how little of the wall is visible. It's sectioned off, with every shop and restaurant having its own piece. As you stare at it you feel nothing, just an emptiness. You do notice a plaque by a large part of unobstructed wall.`
			choice
				`	(Read the plaque.)`
				`	(Return to my ship.)`
					goto ship
			`	The plaque labels the God-Stone as "Colonial Graffiti" and reads:`
			``
			`	During the Colonization of The Deep in the 23rd Century, the earliest colonists erected large metal slabs and wrote pseudo-letters on them. It is believed that this was done in order to raise the prestige of their early worlds. They would claim the stones were powerful alien artifacts, or that they were made by an earlier population of humans who had arrived on the world thanks to the intercession of fairies.`
			`	Either for profit, or out of a longing for home, many local communities promoted these ideas about the origins of these structures. Scientists have determined these structures were once large segments of the metal hulls of the original colony ships. To date, there has been some difficulty in identifying exactly what alloy they were constructed from.`
			`	Most worlds in the Deep have "Colonial Graffiti," and they are proud reminders of our enterprising colonial origins. They are sometimes known in older texts, and by early communities, as God-Stones and Elf-Stones.`
			``
			`	Here at the Helsingor Family-Fun-Shopping-Center, we are committed to celebrating our past! This is why we, in the spirit of graffiti being the cultural touchstone of the day, have renovated this colonial structure into a central communication piece and made it a vital part of our vibrant community!'`
			``
			`	You finish reading the plaque, and look at the dull gray metal wall and the inhuman things carved upon it. It looks nothing like a ship's hull.`
			label ship
			`	These people seem disconnected from their past. You wonder if the Skadenga could help them reconnect with it, but worry that the place would change the Skadenga more than they could change it. There is nothing more you can do here. You head back to your ship.`

Maybe you took us to Asgard to make us stronger, to make us better. It is bitter lesson, but I understand it now."`
