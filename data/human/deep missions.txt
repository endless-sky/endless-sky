			`	Before the admiral can work himself up further, Paris intercedes with the rest of the story. "The cubes that Deep Security had you position on multiple worlds were surveillance devices - sensor cubes, as we call them - designed to track Beelzebub's ship and notify us when the ship was located. It can be presumed that Beelzebub now has access to these cubes and has undoubtedly converted them to work in his favor.

With both Navy and Deep technology now in the hands of this criminal, every available ship will be required to take him down. Given this, we are now hoping that you would be willing to assist us in trapping Beelzebub. The six of your fleets combined would certainly make up for anything that the Navy has lost in the attack."`

			`The remaining fleet quickly enters the atmosphere of Haven and begins scanning the surface. After roughly an hour of flying, you receive a transmission that the Star Queen has been found, along with its coordinates.`
			`	You watch from afar as the Mule lands outside a hangar in some sort of pirate facility. The Mule immediately unloads what looks to be at least four dozen armed soldiers who quickly surround and breach the hangar. "Lieutenant, they have alien technology in here," one of the soldiers says over the radio. "Some of it is from the Hai, but some of it I've never seen before."`
			`	"Plant explosives on any alien technology you find. We don't have the capabilities to take it all back with us. It's better off destroyed."`
			`	After fifteen minutes, the hangar doors slide open to reveal the Star Queen, still intact. You hear chatter over the radio saying that most of the crew and scientists are still inside.`
			`	"Good job, everyone," you hear Lieutenant Paris say over the comms. "Now we just need to make it back to <destination> in one piece." Just as he says that, a bright light pierces the sky, obliterating the Mule while its shields are down. Soldiers begin scrambling into the Star Queen, which quickly takes off into space along with the rest of the fleet. You turn your repulsor engines to full and begin flying up into space behind them as multiple explosions come from the facility behind you.`
