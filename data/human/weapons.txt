	description "Although not the most accurate or damaging of weapons, the Energy Blaster is popular because it is small enough to be installed on even the tiniest of ships. One blaster is not enough to do appreciable damage to anything larger than a fighter, but a ship equipped with several of them becomes a force to be reckoned with."

	description "A Blaster Turret is a pair of Energy Blasters mounted on a rotating platform, allowing it to fire in any direction. Sophisticated software algorithms allow the turret to correct for a target's motion, making the Blaster Turret effective even against small, quickly moving fighters. Because it needs a special mounting point with a 360 degree field of view, not all ships are capable of being equipped with a turret."

	description "The Sidewinder Missile is designed by Lovelace Labs, which is ironically also the designer of the Anti-Missile Turret. Rumors say that the two engineering teams at Lovelace who make the missiles and the anti-missiles are locked in furious competition with each other: the result has been generation after generation of smarter missiles and then smarter turrets to fend them off."
	description "	Although not as powerful or cheap as the popular Meteor missiles, Sidewinders have several advantages, including their superior maneuverability, better tracking systems, and protective casings that make them much harder for anti-missile systems to destroy."

	description "The Javelin Pod fires a rapid stream of unguided missiles. A Javelin Pod does far more damage than any gun of a comparable size, and has a longer range as well, but once a ship has expended all of its ammunition it must leave combat and find a planet where it can buy more, which makes Javelins less useful in protracted battles."
	description "	The weapon's high rate of fire also makes it useful for saturating well-protected ships' anti-missile defenses so that more dangerous projectiles fired by allied ships can sneak through."

	description "Torpedoes are the most powerful homing weapon, but they move slowly enough that fast ships can simply outrun them, making them most useful against large targets or against small ships at times when they are too distracted to dodge. Torpedo launchers are also much larger than other missile systems, so they are most often found in capital ships."

Over a millennium later, this modern incarnation of the Gatling gun sees action in the stars, a testament to its fundamentally robust design - and Dr. Gatling's naivete. While capable of a high fire rate, this gun needs to cool down for twice as long as it fires, and can only sustain a maximum of three seconds of continuous fire.`
