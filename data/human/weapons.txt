	description "Although not the most accurate or damaging of weapons, the Energy Blaster is popular because it is small enough to be installed on even the tiniest of ships. One blaster is not enough to do appreciable damage to anything larger than a fighter, but a ship equipped with several of them becomes a force to be reckoned with."

Sophisticated software algorithms allow the turret to correct for a target's motion, making the Blaster Turret effective even against small, quickly moving fighters. Because it needs a special mounting point with a 360 degree field of view, not all ships are capable of being equipped with a turret."

Whether or not this weapon will destroy the target before it melts its own components is anyone's guess; perhaps the intent was that the twin barrels would intimidate enemies into submission before the weapon would have to be fired."

These saw extensive use on several warships earlier in history, most notably as the main armament of the Firebird when it was first produced. Over time, the development of more advanced weapons such as the Particle Cannon and Plasma Cannon has supplanted the Heavy Blaster on newer craft, but it still performs consistently enough to be found on older serviceable ships."

Tractor beams utilize rudimentary attractor technology to allow ships to attract space debris, be that the ores from a recently mined asteroid, or the dumped cargo from a merchant ship fleeing for its life. This has led to tractor beams being a popular outfit among asteroid miners and pirates alike."

	description `Decades after buying the rights for the Plasma Cannon, Kraz Cybernetics put this weapon on the shelves of every high-end outfitter of the Southern Rim. The repeater has so far proved immensely popular amongst any who braved testing it, and is shaping up to become an essential deterrent for anyone who flaunts their haul for pirate plunder.`
	description `	Derived from the original Plasma Cannon, this heavier version trades off its larger bursts for a much faster rate of fire. Although the smaller bursts of superheated plasma deal far less damage than its predecessor, the volume of fire results in more damage to the target overall.`

	description `When Dr. Richard J. Gatling invented the rapid-fire gun bearing his name in the 19th century, he hoped that its destructiveness would lead to the end of war itself. Over a millennium later, this modern incarnation of the Gatling Gun sees action in the stars, a testament to its fundamentally robust design - and Dr. Gatling's naivete. While capable of a high fire rate, this gun needs to cool down for twice as long as it fires, and can only sustain a maximum of three seconds of continuous fire.`

Gatling spin in his grave with the ferocity of the barrels of his invention, the Gatling Turret was born when a resourceful pirate thought to replace the Energy Blasters on a Blaster Turret with a pair of Gatling Guns. Ever since, the dominion of the Gatling Turret has spread across the Southern Rim, terrorizing merchants and law enforcement alike with its unparalleled ability to tear apart the hulls of ships.`
