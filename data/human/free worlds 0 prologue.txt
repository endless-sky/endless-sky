Despite her distrust of the Republic she has high regard for the Navy because they were the ones, acting without clearance from Parliament, who helped the settlers on Hope to evacuate safely.`
		conversation
			`You join Katya and Mr. Eyes in the restaurant, and order your meals. They are both in high spirits. While you are waiting for the food to arrive, Mr. Eyes raises his glass of wine and says, "A toast, to Captain <last> and our marvelous new toy. May it bring us good information and swift justice."`

My home town is under thirty meters of glacier by now."`
			choice
				`	"Was anyone killed?"`
				`	"How did you escape?"`
			
			`	"The eruption was on the other continent," she explains, "so no one was killed in the blast. It was a slow-moving disaster. We had six months or so to move two million settlers off-world before the temperatures would drop too low to be livable. More than half of the Navy was mobilized to ferry our people to other planets."`
			`	"Here's the best part," says Eyes. "The Navy operates with a certain amount of autonomy. Turns out when they found out about the disaster, they mobilized without even waiting to clear it with Parliament. Which was technically within their mandate, this being a natural disaster. But the Navy is funded by taxes, and the Paradise Planets pay ten times as much in taxes as the Dirt Belt."`
			`	"The Paradise Planets viewed the Navy as their own private security force," says Katya, "so they got really mad when half the Navy suddenly vanished to assist some dirty refugees. Because those admirals gave the order to assist us, millions of lives were saved. And then Parliament fired them."`

			`	"I was a child on Vinci while this was happening," says Eyes. "A Paradise World. I would listen to the news and could never understand why all the adults around me were so very, very angry that the Navy had gone off to rescue two million people from freezing to death. But they told me that we lived in one little island of safety in a dangerous galaxy, and that without the Navy protecting us the pirates or even maybe aliens would sweep in and destroy our homes and take our money. That it was us against the whole galaxy."`

Katya Reynolds, the final member of the Council, is not present.`

			`When you land on <planet>, you discover that Tomek has already found transportation here; he meets you almost as soon as your ship lands. When you step out of the hatch alone, without Katya, he turns away in grief. "I'm sorry," you say, "I couldn't locate her. The whole place is under guard."`
			`	"Very well," he says, "we'll have to pray that she's still hidden there somewhere. In the meantime, we need to make your allegiance official so that you can fight alongside us if it comes to that."`

Believe it or not, you're better off as an official prisoner of war than as a partisan, if you ever do get captured. So, time to start painting."`
			
			label paint
			`	You take the paintbrush, climb on top of your ship, and begin painting it in the green and gold of the Free Worlds. Suddenly you hear a cheer from one of the other ships parked nearby; someone has seen what you are doing and is shouting, "For freedom! Another ship for freedom!" Soon several other people see you, and before long it seems like everyone in the port has picked up the cheer.`
			`	Tomek stands by, silently, until you finish, and then approaches you with an outstretched arm holding onto a license. "Here. You're going to need this. I'm sure your assistance will be invaluable to our cause," he says as you accept the militia license. "Now if you'll excuse me, I must gather the militia for the coming battle."`
			`	You find that the militia are collecting at the spaceport bar. Some congratulate you on joining the Free Worlds, but most are standing around quietly, waiting for something to happen. More gather as time goes by, to the point that the bar becomes overcrowded and militia are waiting in the streets outside the building.`
			`	An hour later, while standing outside the bar, you look up and notice the flashing lights of ship weapon fire off in the distance above the planet. Some militia begin running to their ships, but most stand there like a deer in headlights. Just then, Tomek returns with a megaphone and begins shouting orders. "The Navy has entered the system! We can't let them take it, or they'll have us completely bottled up. This is where it begins. We need to fight! Get to your ships, quickly! We have more reinforcements on their way from deeper in the Rim!`
			`	"And if you can, disable their ships instead of destroying them. These are Navy ships, after all, and most of them don't want war any more than we do. Now go! Your worlds need you!" You hurry to join all the other ships taking off to defend the system.`
