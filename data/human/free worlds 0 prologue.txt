The Act was Parliament's response, stating that taking goods from a human being is piracy, but if the owner or some living representative of theirs is not present in the system, taking those goods is a legal salvage operation.

Katya stayed behind to try to infiltrate the mining compound and collect more information."
		conversation
			`You land some distance from the mining settlement, and Mr. Eyes goes into the airlock in a pressure suit, cycling it to bring in some of the moon's thin atmosphere for him to test. "Firing up my instruments now," he says through the commlink. There is a long pause, and then he starts spouting a long string of creative profanity. Katya runs over to the airlock window to see what is happening.`
			`	Finally, Eyes calms down enough to say, "It's a match! Not only has there been a recent test here, but the signature matches the one we took on Geminus. This is it."`
			`	He cycles the airlock and comes back inside. "Let's fly around and see if we can find the site," he says. After a few hours of flying low over the surface and scanning for radiation signatures, you find a spot that looks like all the other meteorite craters but is full of radiation. Katya and Eyes look at the images of the surface almost in disbelief.`
			`	"Based on the isotopic decay rates, this explosion happened in mid-June," says Eyes. "Just before the attacks happened."`

I'm only detecting enough isotopes to account for one explosion, and you wouldn't just test once. If anything, this shows that the Free Worlds are being framed by someone, and they used one nuke here before bombing Geminus and Martini to make it look like it was the Free Worlds who did it."`

			`	"Katerina," says Eyes, "this is way too dangerous. As I said, if we were able to detect this then so can the Navy, and they probably already have. They could decide to occupy Clink at any moment, and you'd be trapped here with no way out."`
			`	"There's no other way," she says. "We have no time to lose. I'm willing to risk it."`
			`	With deep reservations, you drop her off at the outpost. Katya ruffles her hair and rubs some moon dust onto her face to blend in while asking about the job, which she is quickly offered. "Not many folks care to work up here," says the foreman, "so your help would be much appreciated." You and Eyes return to your ship and get ready to travel to <planet> with the evidence.`

It'll be a short chase, however, if you can't stay out of their weapon range and evade their missiles.

We have more reinforcements on their way from deeper in the Rim!`
