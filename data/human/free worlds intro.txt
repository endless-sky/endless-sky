			`Katya and Eyes lead you to the monastery. As you are approaching, you meet a monk who is wearing a long black robe and kneeling in a small vegetable garden, pulling weeds.

			`	"Sure," says David. "Come inside." The monastery building is a stone and brick structure that looks like pictures you have seen of ancient Earth. He leads you down a long hallway and into a sitting room with furniture that looks equally antique, and then leaves.`

			label outreach
			`	"Consider this," says Katya. "In the galactic south, the average age of a pirate crew member is seventeen years old. And many are much younger than that. They're more like street kids than like hardened criminals."`
			`	Just then, Brother Greg walks in. Mr. Eyes introduces you to him and explains your situation. Greg frowns, thoughtfully. "What do we have to offer in exchange for that information?" he asks.`
			`	Katya says, "Ever since this conflict began, southern space has been swarming not only with an increased militia presence, but with the whole Republic Navy. That must make it awfully hard to be a pirate. Seems like the pirates would be glad if the Navy got what they were looking for and went back up north."`
			`	Brother Greg nods. "It's worth a try. Why don't you join us for dinner, and we'll depart for Greenrock in the morning. When we get there, just hail the planet and let me do the talking, and I can probably get permission to land for free."`
			`	You join the brothers for a simple but delicious dinner, soup and salad made entirely from their own gardens. After dinner, Greg asks you, "Do you want to join us for evening prayer?"`

				goto morning
			
			label prayer
			`	"Evening prayer" turns out to be a lengthy church service that apparently begins with the monks listing every bad thing they can possibly imagine and praying that it would not happen: "From lightning and tempest; from earthquake, fire, and flood; from plague, pestilence, and famine, good Lord, deliver us. From all oppression, conspiracy, and rebellion; from violence, battle, and murder; and from dying suddenly and unprepared, good Lord, deliver us..." It's very monotonous.`
			`	At some point, they switch to praying for different people: for the Parliament of the Republic, and everyone in authority; for the governor of <origin>, their world; for the Quarg and all sentient species; for prisoners, for the homeless and poor, for orphans, for pregnant women and young children, for travelers, for starship crews and captains, for miners and oil crews, for mill and factory workers; for the abused; for the mentally ill; for pirates and street gangs; for all creatures and planets vulnerable to exploitation or ecological destruction. (Eyes, who is sitting next to you, responds to that last petition with a fervent "Amen!") The litany is so detailed and specific that you find it both exhausting and fascinating.`
			`	When the service ends, the monks depart for their rooms in silence, and Eyes, with a brief nod to you, does the same.`
			
			label morning
			`	At breakfast in the monastery, Mr. Eyes tells you, "I'm going to be staying here until you get back. Greenrock is no place for a man with a price on his head. But Katya will be going with you." You bring Katya and Greg back to your ship and get ready to take off.`

I talked to one friend who had done research into nuclear development 'for purely academic reasons,' and he said that only a fool would perform atmospheric tests; Intelligence would notice that immediately, no matter what world you were on.
