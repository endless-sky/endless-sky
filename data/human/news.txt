			"Pirate attacks keep getting more and more frequent, even in star systems that used to be perfectly safe. Why isn't the Navy doing something about it?"
			"I keep hearing rumors about ships disappearing north of Syndicate space. It's probably a bunch of hot air, but either way, I'm staying away from there!"
			"I try to stick to safe parts of space if I can. Pirate attacks are too much risk for my tastes."
			"It's such a shame how much the political situation has deteriorated. We're all humans; why can't we just get along?"
			"I always buy my engines in the Deep. They sell the best of the best up there."
			"With all these pirate attacks, so many people seem to be arming up and outfitting themselves for war, but I think that's a waste of money. Powerful engines, a scram drive, an afterburner, and some anti-missile defenses are all you need to stay safe."
			"Slow and steady wins the race. Hauling cargo may not be very glamorous, but with a big enough fleet, you can net a million a week."
			"Have you ever done any of those jobs moving black cubes around the Deep? I did that a few times but started to get a really weird vibe, and now I stay away if I can. They're hiding something big up there, and I don't want to have any part in it."
			"Have you visited the collapsed wormhole north of Delta Velorum? Well, that's what I think it is, at least. I keep waiting for news that an alien fleet is pouring out of it. I'm sure there must be a way in, too. Haven't found it yet, but I'm not giving up!"
			"A lot of people don't seem to like Syndicate tech, but I don't see what they're complaining about. It's cheap and it gets the job done."
			"My first ship was a Star Barge. Took me seven weeks to get across the galaxy in that old tin can, and my cargo hold smelled of fish the whole time!"
			"My first ship was a Sparrow. How I survived my first week in space, I'm still not sure!"
			"My first ship was a Shuttle. I kind of miss that glorified tour bus."
			"I love doing Syndicate jobs. Easy money for not much work. I guess they're all so rich that they can afford to pay for the best."
			"Why does the Deep restrict the sale of City-Ships? They don't seem that much better than other warships or freighters."
			"I just don't get why anyone would pick the pirate life. Sure, no rules, but any government that doesn't force you to have 10 licenses just to look at a heavy warship is free enough to me."
			"I've heard rumors of captains seeing the distinct flash of whatever Quarg ships use to jump near the core. Wonder what the Quarg are doing up there."
			"Being a pirate must be a lose-lose scenario. You do badly and you end up enslaved to a stronger pirate. You do well and you get enough attention to get targeted by the Navy or Militia."
			"I think that people are too harsh towards pirates. Not all of them are heartless."
			"Be careful when taking suspicious jobs. You might end up at the wrong end of a gun."
			"Always check the spaceport for jobs. Some of them pay quite well."
			"Falcons are the best! They're faster and sleeker than any other civilian warship!"
			"Leviathans are the best! They're tankier and can hold more firepower than any other civilian warship!"
			"Why would anyone use a Falcon? They have specifications worse than the Leviathan in every way, and Falcon hulls cost more to produce."
			"How could anyone use a Leviathan? They're dreadfully slow and an eyesore to look at."
			"Don't be fooled by the Falcon's low retail price! Once you strip out all the outfits, you'll find that the hull costs more than a Leviathan's."
			"People may tell you otherwise, but I think that Vanguards are the best. They have such powerful frontal weaponry."
			"Warships may have both speed and weaponry on their side, but if you're looking for something to last, use a Behemoth."
			"I don't get how people could get worked up over what ship to use. As long as I'm in my trusty Protector, I'm happy."
			"Ugh. Why are fighter pilots so gung-ho about charging right into the guns of their enemies? At the very least, don't make me waste hundreds of thousands of credits replacing my ships when you kill yourself."
			"Don't you think it's strange that the Navy lets you buy their offensive fighters but not any of their other ships?"
			"I wonder why shipyards haven't capitalised on making alternatives to the Navy combat drone. Probably because the only ships that can use drones are Navy ships, I guess."
			"Some of the names that captains give their ships are awful. Seriously, I've seen ships named 'Ship.'"
			"I'm convinced merchant captains make the worst jokes."
			"What's up with the Deep? One moment, they have a defense force on par with the Navy, the next, they're asking random schmucks to help escort their fleets. How the mighty have fallen, I guess."
			"I swear: Sparrows are so laughably weak that Flivvers are a better option for an interceptor."
			"I was doing some jobs in the Core, when an enormous alien warship jumped in and attacked! People say I'm crazy, but I'm lucky to have gotten out of there with my life!"
			"The Syndicate tries to keep alien attacks under wraps, but if you've been around as long as I have, you'll see them eventually."
			"I was working a Syndicate defense job once, expecting to only deal with some pirates. Instead, I had to drive off an alien warship that jumped in same way the Quarg do! They made us sign a non-disclosure agreement, so don't tell anyone I said that."

			"The Quarg don't appear to even bother with hyperspace lanes. Their drives apparently teleport their ships from one system to another. If that's true, then they would be able to visit the systems inaccessible to our hyperdrives."
			"Even if they aren't directly linked by hyperspace lanes, your ship can still detect systems near you. Not that it matters, though, since we still can't jump to those systems."
			"The field of hyperspace lane destruction is filled with misunderstanding and pseudoscience. If there was a method to remove hyperspace lanes, though, whoever discovered it would effectively control human space."
			"Many a hyperspace-based weapon has been tested, but due to the dynamics of entering hyperspace while not aligned with a hyperspace lane, all of them have failed. Thankfully."

			"Next year I hope I can afford to book passage on a ship with nicer accommodations. I had to listen to the reactor's noisy humming for the whole five-day trip here!"
			"I come here every year."
			"Can you believe that our ship was attacked by pirates on the way here? It's lucky a Navy patrol showed up and chased them off before our shields dropped. It was all so exciting! I'm taking the same route again next year."
			"I can't wait to go skiing here! Haha, just kidding."
			"It's too bad I have to leave tomorrow. I only get two weeks of vacation a year, and it's hard to leave after spending half that time in transit here and back."
			"I'm not riding on any ship that doesn't have the decency to have luxurious accommodations!"

			"Can you tell me again which planet this is? No, I'm not lost, I just don't know where I am."
			"We did a ride on an ancient spacecraft the other day. It was called something like Soyuz or Shuttle Dragon. I don't remember the name exactly, but it was horrible; my back still hurts from the bumpy ride."
			"I almost missed my transport last week; someone was wrong on the hypernet and I was in a long, heated discussion to correct it."

			"Have you seen my luggage? I'm sure I put it here some minutes ago."
