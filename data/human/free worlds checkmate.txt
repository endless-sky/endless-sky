We have already verified that it carries no nuclear weapons, and this building's shielding and anti-missile systems are quite sufficient to defend against conventional weapons. And there is nothing in its cargo hold but ordinary, non-radioactive metals."`
			`	Alondo says, "That's right. Tungsten, to be exact. Aerodynamic tungsten rods, each the size of a tree trunk, with a simple guidance system on one end. Our ship is in low earth orbit, traveling at a velocity of roughly eight kilometers per second." As he speaks, the Parliament chamber gradually grows very quiet. "So we will be returning to our ship," says Alondo, "with Miss Reynolds. If the ship in orbit does not hear from me every two minutes, it will jettison its cargo, and there will be nothing left of this building but a crater." He points to the watch he is wearing, and you realize that it must be some sort of communicator.`
			`	After a brief whispered consultation with a few of the other members of Parliament, Xao says, "You will lose this war, and you will pay dearly for it. Guards, let them return to their ship." You hurry back to your ship and take off immediately, aware that as soon as you are out of range of Earth, the Navy will probably be more than willing to attack you.`

			`The tiny spaceport on Silver is packed with people as more and more Navy ships come in for a landing. The Navy admirals have decided that there is no sense in delaying: you will be launching an attack on the Pug homeworld in the morning. Despite your success so far in battling the Pug, you know that if their entire fleet opposes you, even the Navy may not be strong enough to defeat them. This may be the last time you see many of these officers and crew members alive.`
			`	Everyone prepares for death in different ways. The spaceport's pub is packed, with the crowd spilling out into the hallway and loud music blasting. The chapel is equally full, and the sound of whispered prayers and chanting clashes with the dance music from the pub. Through the doorway of the chapel you see some people sitting cross-legged on the floor and others kneeling on prayer rugs, as the various cultures that make up the Republic do their best to share the space.`
			`	You find Freya sitting in a secluded nook on the upper floor of the spaceport building, watching the stars and the drifting sand out the window. "Ready for the last battle, Captain?" she asks.`
			choice
				`	"Sure, with the Navy at our backs I think we've got a good chance."`
				`	"As ready as I'll ever be, I guess."`
			`	She laughs. "I suppose that's the best we can hope for. Do you mind if I ride in your ship tomorrow, rather than one of the others? If this is the end, I'd rather face it with people I know." You agree. She turns back to look out the window.`
			`	Since Freya seems to want to be alone, you return downstairs, and discover that a sizeable Oathkeeper fleet has arrived. In the main vestibule of the spaceport, an Oathkeeper officer is leading a group in qigong meditation. And surprisingly, you spot Admiral Danforth sitting with the Muslim prayer group and chanting in fluent Arabic. Meanwhile, the party outside the pub continues.`
			`	Eventually morning comes, and you prepare your ship for the assault on the Pug homeworld...`

And, it turns out that many of their cities on "Pugglemug" were only for show: buildings with no inhabitants, and with holograms creating the appearance of a heavily populated world. They left no advanced technology behind, and no sign of what their true intentions were, but it turns out that the fake cities here were designed for human habitation.

			`	The Navy ships are beginning to land and send crew out to explore. You and Freya walk into the city, passing by a pair of adult Pug who sit at a table outside what looks like some sort of cafe, playing a board game with black and white stones on a hexagonal grid.

			`	You try to talk to the Pug, but they, like the children, are ignoring you completely; they do not even seem to be aware of your existence. Finally, Freya reaches out to shake one of them by the shoulder, and her hand passes straight through it. Surprised, she waves her hands back and forth through both of them. "Some sort of holographic projection," she says.`

			`	You continue to explore for a while. Aside from the illusions, the city seems to be deserted. "Let's check inside one of the houses," Freya says at last. You climb up the steps to what looks like an apartment building and find that all the doors are unlocked. Inside one of the living spaces, you explore the different rooms and find that the water fixtures and electricity are working, but a thick layer of dust covers everything. Freya, meanwhile, is staring at one of the electrical outlets. "<first>," she says, "do you see anything odd about this?"`
			choice
				`	"No, it's just an ordinary electric outlet."`
				`	"Everything here is odd. The city, the holograms, all of it."`
			`	She says, "It's an ordinary, human style electrical outlet. Human. In an alien city. And the steps we came up to get here: the Pug have legs half again as long as ours. But the tread spacing was at the normal human height. This building wasn't made for the Pug. It was made for us."`
			`	Reports begin coming in as the Navy explores the rest of the planet, and they are all finding the same thing: the cities are abandoned, many of them with signs that they were never inhabited in the first place. The first time you visited this planet, you thought it must have a billion inhabitants, but now it seems that its true population was less than a million - all of whom have apparently departed to somewhere beyond the wormhole.`

We agreed to limiting our territory to its current size, and to a very minor tax to cover the cost of Navy protection if the aliens attack again or some other major catastrophe strikes. In return, the Free Worlds have been granted autonomy from the Republic."`
