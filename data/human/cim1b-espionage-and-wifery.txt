			`	"Look, I hope we can know each other in the future, in better circumstances, and thank you for the lovely gift and the flowers - you must have looked after them well to keep them from wilting on your travel through space.

You mean a maid at one of his offices, don't you?" You detect a hint of panic in her voice.`

			`	"Susanna, darling. You have a right to be angry. We all have a right to be angry. But at William, not <first>. What William, our husband, has done is despicable, but you must listen to the truth. <first>," she turns to you, "leave us a while to talk."`

			`<origin> certainly isn't the most pleasant planet to live on, with dim sunlight filtering through a heavy atmosphere, as if every day is the sunset over a smoggy city, grasping for air to avoid being sucked into the mossy ground. Amanda meets you outside the spaceport to take you to visit Felicity.`
			`	"Now <first>, you must understand, Felicity has made her bed with Mr Washermann and must take the responsibility of getting out of it."`
			choice
				`	"But we're still going to help her, right?"`
			`	"We are. And she's going to need our help, because her mess is really much worse than any of ours." Aunt Amanda explains, as you walk, that Uncle WC brought Felicity to <origin> just a year after they were married on Sunracer. Gradually, he reduced her allowance and made her start working in the plastic industry - first easy work, then harder. But the work barely pays enough for her to live, let alone think of moving.`
			`	"It gets worse," says Amanda, "but Felicity can tell you about it - here's her place now." The 'place' is a small hut, not too bad looking but a vast decrease from even the humblest of your other aunts' homes.`
			`	Felicity welcomes you in, fresh from work, and goes straight to the sink to wash the grease off her hands. She pulls up some chairs for the three of you and tells you her story. Much of it is what Amanda's already told you, just with more detail.`
			`	"So now I can't leave <origin>," she says. "Even if I could find the money. Mr ---- Washermann has paid off some bigwigs so if I seek a divorce, or even leave the planet, I get put on some stupid blacklist and can't find work or rent in the whole of Syndicate space."`

Not only can't Felicity work if she leaves, a pirate captain will track her down and capture her as she leaves the system. Whether he'll take her to Mr Washermann or for his own purposes, who can say."`

You discuss for a while and Amanda agrees to furnish Felicity with a gift of enough money to get her started in a new life. Discussion turns to where to go. You pull out maps and star charts, but at most places you suggest Felicity gets nervous about everything that could go wrong. It seems she's been under WC's dark shadow so long she doesn't know how to step out. Everywhere is either too expensive, to hard to get started, too dangerous, too close to Syndicate space, or involved in the war.`
			`	Eventually you look over to the small triangle of systems at the far South-East of the known galaxy. "Who lives there?" Felicity asks. "A race of powerful, benevolent aliens," you say. These worlds are home to the Quarg, and according to your map one planet, Humanika, is accessible and hospitable to humans. This, at last, sounds good to Felicity, and you just hope the Quarg are truly as benevolent as they're said to be. On your travels round the galaxy, you've found many people distrust them, but no one actually has any suggestion they do evil to humans.`

She won't get a single credit! ...And as for you--" she clearly has too much anger to spew at one person "--you can get paid however you like but me and my girls will be finding our own way home. Get lost."`
			`	You oblige, and make sure to send a message to Maurissa to warn her of incoming trouble. She sends one back: not to worry, WC's had this coming a long time, and as for her ever since the holiday on Sunracer she's been saving up a retirement fund that he can't touch.`

			`Burthen's crushingly high gravity really puts a damper on the party spirit. When they get to their suite in the hotel, one of the girls puts on the music and for a while they try to dance under their own weight, but it doesn't last long. You yourself are more interested in the hotel's massively-substandard building quality. This is a hotel built on corruption: advertised as a glamourous oasis of luxury; full of gaps under the doors, rickety windows, and - useful to your purposes today - paper-thin walls.`
			`	You take up lodging in a more comfortable establishment nearby, but hang around enough to see your uncle go in with a group of drably-suited men, and later you do some eavesdropping of your own. WC's deal goes terribly, and he loses his temper many times, and shouts at his would-be partners that they're ruining him, leaving his children hungry and destitute, and he'll be a beggar for the rest of his days from their greed and unfair dealing. He looks quite pleased with himself when he comes out, though, so probably he got the deal he wanted in the end - but that was quiet, and the bit you needed was shouted to the high heavens. Meanwhile, you notice, the girls' music was turned down as if to listen in. You turn away and hope your uncle didn't see you.`

			`	The next day as you meet the hen party in the hotel lobby, Gael is disheveled and angry as she comes to speak with you.`
			`	"Do you know who that man was?" she asks with no reference to which man she might mean.`
			`	"No," you reply, "who?"`
			`	"That was the man I *was* going to marry. And the man who's paying your bills. You'd better tell your manager to get payment quickly, because he's all cleaned out. Ruined. By some stupid business gone wrong." She pauses for a moment to recover her breath. "And this hotel is the worst place I've stayed in ever. And this planet too! I'll find a different captain to take us home, and make a complaint to your manger too. Good riddance!"`
			`	You bow as gracefully as you can under the high gravity, and make your way back to your ship. That went as well as could be expected. But all's well that ends well.`
