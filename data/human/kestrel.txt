			`As you are visiting one of the spaceport bars, a man recognizes you. "<first> <last>!" he says. "It's an honor to meet you. Your exploits in battle are well known." He picks up his drink and walks over to sit next to you. "My name is Charles Atinoda," he says, "the chief starship designer for Tarazed Corporation. Say, would you be willing to help us test out a new warship?"`
			choice
				`	"Tell me more."`
				`	"Sorry, I don't have time right now."`
					defer
			`	"Well," he says, "here's the story. Seven years ago, in a time of deep personal crisis, I left my job at Tarazed to wander the galaxy with nothing in my backpack but a change of clothes, a canteen of water, and a few boxes of emergency rations. An anarchist commune on one of the fringe worlds took me in. After I had been there for a month, the village elder, sensing my inner turmoil, invited me to a vision quest in their sweat lodge. I fell into a trance and my consciousness journeyed through many universes, where I saw strange things. I saw a sword made of light. I saw a blue sun. I saw..." He pauses for a moment. "... a Welsh Corgi hacking into a computer? Some of it was hard to understand."`
			choice
				`	"Fascinating."`
					goto continue
				`	"Were there illicit substances involved in this vision quest?"`
			`	He ignores your question. "But then I saw one more thing," he says.`
				goto kestrel

			`	"But then I saw one more thing," he says.`
			label kestrel
			`	He is silent for a long moment, then says, "I saw a dark ship, more graceful and elegant than any I had ever designed, battling an alien vessel with a mottled red hull. And when I saw that ship, I knew that I must build one like it. I hitched a ride back to Wayfarer, begged for my old job back, and got to work. Seven years later, the ship is nearly done. It has passed all our non-destructive testing with flying colors, which leaves only the combat test remaining. And who better to battle it than the renowned warrior, <first> <last>?"`
			choice
				`	"I would be glad to."`
					goto test
				`	"What will I receive in return?"`
			`	"A generous payment," he says, "and the right to purchase one of the very first units off the production line, if you wish."`
			`	"Sounds fair," you say.`
			label test
			`	"Excellent," he says. "I'll need your signature on a few forms. Waivers of liability in case you die, permission to use your name and likeness in certain promotional materials. You know, the usual legal stuff."`
			choice
				`	"No problem. Where will I battle this ship?"`
				`	"Sorry, I don't think I can agree to that."`
					decline
			`	"We do most of our starship testing in the <waypoints> system," he says. "The test ship is unmistakable. Journey there, disable it without destroying it, then return here and we'll ask you about any weaknesses you found or improvements you would make. And if you destroy the ship or steal it, naturally you will forfeit your payment."`

			`	When you say the word 'Kestrel' he jerks as if he's just been electrocuted. "Yes," he says, "that's it! That's the name we'll go with. Thank you, Captain. I will let you know as soon as the Kestrel is available for sale, and we will take your recommendations into account when making our final modifications to the design." He pays you two million credits and wishes you the best of luck in your future endeavors.`
