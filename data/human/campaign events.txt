		log "Factions" "Alphas" `The Alphas were designed hundreds of years ago as genetically engineered super-soldiers, with no compassion or empathy. They escaped from their masters, enslaved entire planets, and commanded massive fleets of ships. Eventually they were defeated, and were either killed or went into hiding. They can be recognized by their green, photosynthetic skin.`
			`Alphas can live for centuries, and it is likely that many of them have survived, hiding out on anarchist worlds or somewhere beyond human space. Fortunately, they reproduce much more slowly than ordinary humans do.`
		conversation
			`Today, throughout human space, is Remembrance Day, the anniversary of the beginning of the Alpha Wars more than five centuries ago. The Alphas were genetically engineered soldiers, with superhuman agility and intelligence, and a complete lack of compassion or empathy. At the height of the War, dozens of planets had been enslaved by the Alphas.`
			`	Remembrance Day commemorates the beginning of the war, rather than its end, as a perpetual reminder that the war is not over: although the Alphas were defeated, some of them escaped and remained in hiding, and they and their offspring are presumed to still be present in the galaxy today.`
			`	Since the Alpha War, genetic resequencing technology has been very tightly controlled. Because the Alphas were the product of experimental genetic manipulation rather than natural evolution, it is believed that their genes are less robust than true human beings, and they are almost unable to have viable offspring without access to special technology. Therefore, most Alpha enclaves that have been discovered since the War have had very small populations, no more than a few dozen.`
			`	In these days when the Navy ensures peace throughout much of the galaxy, on many worlds the Alphas are treated as nothing more than a bogeyman story to frighten children. Because the most striking physical feature of the Alphas was their photosynthetic skin, on some worlds kids even run around wearing green face paint on Remembrance Day, trying to frighten people. But on other worlds, especially on the fringes of space where the Navy seldom patrols, the Alphas are still spoken of with fear.`

Recently, a collection of planetary governments in the southern galactic arm have sent the Republic what amounted to an ultimatum: a refusal to pay taxes until reforms are made in the election of planetary representatives.

Three hours ago, though, the Navy Yard here on Geminus was bombed along with the Galactic Stock Exchange on Martini. We don't know if it's the work of the 'Free Worlds' rebels or not, and I can't promise you there aren't going to be more attacks.

Three hours ago, though, someone - quite possibly this same 'Free Worlds' group - dropped a nuclear bomb on the Galactic Stock Exchange right here on Martini. At least, we presume that the Stock Exchange was their target, since the bomb took about a quarter of the city with it, as well as the main spaceport and half of the planet's medical resources. We've got more than a million injured people here and another five million we need to evacuate. To top it off, the terrorists also bombed the Navy Yard on Geminus, which means we don't have enough personnel available to both run the evacuation and deal with other civilians."`

I'm not sure how you managed to get landing clearance, but you shouldn't be here. We've got thousands of injured people to get off-planet, even if we ignore the potential for a major follow-up attack. If you refuse to comply, I will have you arrested by the military police, and your ship will be impounded. If your crew refuses to accept the change in captainship, they will be replaced by troops from the Naval Reserve Command. Think what you will, but we've got human lives to save here and we aren't going to stop just because some hotshot captain is feeling full of themself. Is that clear?"`

As you're frogmarched toward a waiting bunker, you watch as the <ship> lifts off without you, leaving you stranded here. In the bunker, one of the soldiers who arrested you frisks you, seizing your pilot's license and handing it to a sergeant who stamps the words "Permanently Revoked" across it. With those two words, you are barred from space forever. It has been less than a year since you bought your ship, and already you have lost the right to use it as the galaxy falls apart on you.`

Only then do you see that you've left the video screen in your ship on, playing footage almost identical to what you saw on the ground not long ago. According to the newscaster, this debacle was all started yesterday, when a group of planets in the south of the galaxy sent the Republic Parliament an ultimatum: a refusal to pay taxes until reforms are made in the election of planetary representatives. This group, calling itself the "Free Worlds," has also asked for immediate reevaluation of all existing trade tariffs and regulations concerning pilot registration.

			`When you walk into <origin>'s outfitter, you notice it has a raft of new outfits for sale; cooling equipment, afterburners, even new generators. Strangely, almost all the new stock appears to be from Kraz Cybernetics and Delta V - companies you'd usually see selling along the Southern Rim, not far up here so close to the center of the Republic. It is especially strange as those companies have been vocal supporters of the Free Worlds secessionists.`

			`	The proprietor's busy at his desk inside the outfitter's small office, but as you approach he gets up and acknowledges you. "Hi, how can I help you today?"`
			choice
				`	"How come you're selling Kraz and Delta V outfits up here?"`
				`	"It looks like you've got new stock."`
					goto "new stock"
				`	(Move on.)`

			`	"You're not the first to ask!" the proprietor responds overly brightly. "With piracy on the rise, the increased tensions, and - what everybody's assuming but not saying - impending conflict with the nuke-happy secessionists down in the Southern Rim, we've had a lot of requests to stock some more... specialized equipment."`
			`	He walks you over to a crate of Javelins. "A load of this stuff comes from the Syndicate, you know. Apparently they already had a load of these missiles in production, but now that Kraz and Delta V are no longer companies operating in the Republic, they've snapped up all the rights to manufacture their products!" He chuckles. "It's great for captains who rely on Delta V equipment but can't go down to the Southern Rim to restock their gear."`
				goto end

			label "new stock"
			`	"Yes, yes we do!" He walks up to you. "Nitrogen coolers, Heavy Rockets, radar jammers to ward off those pesky Lovelace Sidewinders, high-power afterburners, you name it. We've had a lot of requests to stock equipment from the Southern Rim, now with all the tension down there making it hard to do business."`
			`	The proprietor leans in towards you a little and says in a softer tone, "But you know, it's wrong to get supplies from the people who did those bombings and killed tens of thousands of people. It's simply wrong. Morally and commercially.`
			`	"Courtesy of Syndicated Systems, however, you can get southern gear here without supporting those secessionists! They saw an opportunity to get the rights for Delta V and Kraz equipment, and they took it. And you get to benefit," he chuckles.`

			label end
			`	He produces a brochure from his vest jacket and hands it to you. "Now, if you're interested in any of our new stock, just flag down one of our workers and we'll have it prepared and installed on your ship promptly.`
			`	"I wish you safe travels," he says, and returns to his office.`

		description `The dense clouds in Winter's atmosphere block out much of the sunlight, creating a frigid landscape below. The planet was not settled until about a century ago, when a group of investors from Pherkad decided to build a manufacturing center here, rather than trying to find more land on the already overcrowded planet of Solace. Claiming that the industrial emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases would eventually warm the planet and turn it into a tropical paradise, they were able to draw enough settlers to keep the factories going.`

		add attributes "ex-pirate"
		description `Thule is a mountainous world with a population of nearly a billion, settled in the early days of space exploration. When the colony was first established, the government on Earth did not yet have the strength to control any system but its own. As such, Thule refused to join the Republic when it was formed, and has since repulsed all efforts to force it to do so.`
		description `	Until recently, Thule was a well-known den of pirate activity, but the major tribal authorities have now forsworn piracy in the interest of keeping the Free Worlds from further meddling in their affairs. However, it is likely that all manner of illegal activity is still going on in secret here.`
	planet "Smuggler's Den"
		description `Smuggler's Den was formerly known as Grendel Station, back when it was an operating refinery. After that, it was taken over by pirates, and became a haven for all manner of smugglers and privateers. Now, at least in theory, it is an independent station no longer allied with the pirates. In practice, you suspect a fair amount of piracy still goes on here.`
		description `The repair shops here can make a variety of legal and illegal modifications to your ship, and in the shipyard you can buy refurbished starships... if it does not trouble your conscience to think about the likely fates of their previous owners.`
		spaceport `It is a strange but indisputable fact that anarchists smell worse than ordinary human beings. In this day and age, where even the cheapest shuttlecraft at least has a sonic shower, there is no logical explanation for it, except that anarchist tendencies must somehow go hand in hand with a tendency to reject society's norms around hygiene. Here in a space station, with nothing but recycled air to breathe, the effect is overpowering.`

		description `Greenrock was the closest thing that the pirates in southern human space had to a center of government, at least until the Free Worlds occupied it. When rival pirate bands sought to negotiate on neutral territory, this is where they met. Nearly everything was for sale here: illegal weapons, ships customized for pirating, and even slaves.`
		description `	Now that the Free Worlds are occupying the system, Greenrock has become a marginally more respectable world. Pirates still run wild in the wilderness of the planet, but the Free Worlds are actively arresting criminals and freeing slaves in the population centers.`
		spaceport `You have heard enough about this port's reputation that you are not surprised to see the remnants of slave markets, now empty as a result of the Free Worlds occupation. The normally shady establishments are now filled with militia and the occasional merchant captain looking to explore the planet while it's still in Free Worlds hands.`
		spaceport `	Despite the Free Worlds presence, dark alleyways are still to be avoided. Down one alley you see an abandoned shop called "Mike's Mustelids," now overrun by weasels, ferrets, and wolverines that were once caged there.`

		spaceport `	With the Free Worlds now gone, dark alleyways are absolutely to be avoided. Down one alley you see a shop called "Mike's Mustelids," the inside like a jungle. You hear the howls and yells of various exotic animals coming from inside, and the alleyway is home to a number of presumably-escaped weasels, ferrets, and wolverines running about.`



event "Greenrock recovered"
	planet "Greenrock"
		description `Greenrock is the closest thing that the pirates in southern human space have to a center of government, but taking the form of large, powerful corporations rather than elected officials. When rival pirate bands seek to negotiate on neutral territory, this is where they meet. Nearly everything is for sale here: illegal weapons, ships customized for pirating, and even slaves.`
		description `	The Free Worlds occupied this planet for a short while long ago, attempting to clean up the criminal hub, but almost all traces of the Free Worlds' influence on the planet is now long gone.`
		spaceport `You have heard enough about this port's reputation that you are not surprised to see the slave markets, heavily guarded in case any visitors happen to find themselves in possession of a conscience. Nor are you shocked by the shady establishments catering to all manner of prurient interests. This is, after all, a pirate port, and everything is for sale here.`
		spaceport `	Everything, in fact, including the very bizarre. You find one dark alley that has been completely fenced off from the rest of the spaceport, the howls of animals coming from behind the barrier. Beside the alley you see a sign for a shop called "Mike's Mustelids," promising the sale of "exotic animals from within Greenrock's urban spaceport jungle."`



event "memorial on Deep"
	planet "Deep"
		spaceport `The spaceport is built on a large island, a now-extinct volcano with an elevation of several kilometers at its center. Most of the large-scale fishing here is done by a single company, Poseidon Industries, which also built and maintains the spaceport. Steep winding roads and sturdy concrete homes and warehouses line the mountain slopes, and below you in the harbor several massive trawling vessels are moored. On the outskirts of the spaceport are the ramshackle houses and open-air marketplace used by the smaller, independent fishing families.`
		spaceport `	Positioned north of the spaceport is the Free Worlds War Memorial, a series of granite walls engraved with the names of the fallen. The nine completed walls are already filled on both sides; it seems unlikely the other fourteen walls will last the war.`

It is also several times larger than necessary for the number of people and ships that are here, and aside from a lively market, it feels strangely empty.`
		spaceport `	Some things remain unchanged from back in the pirate days. The local slang incorporates threats of extreme violence as a seemingly meaningless verbal tic. "Hey, I'm gonna cut off your fingers one by one until you buy a meat patty!" a vendor calls out cheerfully as you pass. "First one's free, and I'll tie a knot in your spine if you don't like it."`

		description `Bloodsea is nearly uninhabited, except for a few small outposts. Its name comes from the planet's oceans, which are blood-red due to rhodophyte algae. Although the climate is temperate and there are many white sand beaches, no one comes here hoping to go swimming.`
		description `	Until recently, this was a pirate world, but they are now officially "independent," forswearing support for piracy and other criminal activity as a result of being dominated by the Free Worlds militia. You get the feeling that most of the locals are not too fond of the Free Worlds, however.`

The first settlers on Albatross were anarchists who believed that in a society free from unnatural laws and constraints, everyone would happily and freely work for the common good. The next settlers were pirates who believed that a planet free from laws and constraints would be a great base of operations.`
		description `	Recently, the Free Worlds have liberated Albatross from their pirate oppressors, but many of the locals remain skeptical, seeing the Free Worlds as little different from the other protection rackets that have held sway over them.`

On the outskirts of the spaceport are the ramshackle houses and open-air marketplace used by the smaller, independent fishing families.`

		description `	The shattered remnants of the old Navy Yard are still left abandoned and slowly rusting away in the planet's caustic atmosphere, but the Republic has now built a new shipyard to replace the one destroyed in the bombing, and once again Geminus has become a central hub of technology and industry.`
		spaceport `Like everything else on Geminus, the spaceport is not terribly pretty, but is functional and efficient. Each of the wide hallways is marked out like a road, with space in the center for electric carts carrying cargo, while pedestrians are relegated to the edges. Video cameras and sensors have been placed at every intersection, and access to the shipbuilding facilities is tightly controlled.`
		spaceport `	The hub of the spaceport is a food court with a ring of shops in the center and seating on the outside, where you can look out of plate glass windows at the lava fields and caldera outside. By night, you can see the volcanic glow all around the horizon.`

		description `	The new capital city is on the other side of the main continent, where lingering radiation will not affect the rest of the population. It is not so grand as the old capital, but its population has swelled from resettlement from the irradiated areas and it is quickly gaining the air of a major metropolis. The inhabitants, many of whom are survivors of the blast, have rallied behind a sort of 'will-do' attitude that only occurs after such a devastating and destructive event.`
		spaceport `Currently, the newly-designated planetary spaceport does not possess the infrastructure to act as Martini's main spaceport. The expansive temporary spaceport from the relief operation is still being used, and since then, permanent landing pads have been built, but there are now plans to demolish it and give the new planetary spaceport a desperately needed expansion.`
		spaceport `	Martini's old spaceport still remains, as it was located just outside the blast zone and its deflector shields bore the brunt of the shockwave, but its towers partially collapsed in the days following the devastation. It now appears from a distance to be a few unevenly-levelled black spires rising before a backdrop of the smoke and remnants of a ruined city, no longer gleaming as it once did.`
