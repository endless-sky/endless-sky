			`You arrive on Earth and take a series of shuttles to get to Fez, Morocco where you expect to meet Daemos Titan. As with all old cities, the outer regions are monstrous mega-buildings built in the last few centuries. As you move inward, you see skyscrapers of the 20th to 22nd centuries.`
			`	You turn a corner and see something you never thought you would see on the infamously-gray planet of Earth: a large, green, field of grass with a beautiful mosque. It looks like something out of Earth's ancient history, perfectly preserved in present day.`
			choice
				`	(Enter the library.)`
			`	On your way to the library, a scruffy-looking man approaches you. He has a rather large gun in his holster and a massive book strapped to his back. He starts staring intently at you, or possibly through you. His dark red sunglasses and porcupine beard make it difficult to read his face (or even see it). When the man abruptly stops walking you consider yelling for help, fearing you're about to be mugged or shot.`
			`	Suddenly he seems startled as if from some terrible gastrointestinal distress. He dives to the nearest bench, pulls the gigantic book off of his back, and starts jotting notes. You're not sure he even noticed you. His mind had wandered to whatever metaphysical world scholars occupy when reality has no bearing on their lives.`

				goto question
			label watch
			`	Between bouts of mumbling, reading, ranting, and writing, the man strokes his beard as if petting a cat. Eventually, his frantic scribbling on the giant book runs off the bottom of a page and his pencil breaks. He looks sad for a moment, and then notices you.`
			`	His beard ruffles as he asks, "Yes?"`
				goto question

			`When you arrive, you see Daemos Titan eager to depart. He walks at a brisk pace towards your ship without even telling you his destination. Porters behind push a cart with an impressive number of books and at least a thousand pencils. You notice there is no modern equipment; not even a data pad.`
			`	"Let's go already," he says. "The five Chal Jub Paqmey are not getting any younger."`
			`	"Go where?"`
			`	"Yes, yes, yes. Details." He fumbles about his person and eventually finds a folded piece of paper in his beard. He shoves it at you so fast that his hand almost hits you. You're fairly certain it wasn't meant as a hostile gesture. This man simply hasn't talked to anyone other than himself for so long that he's forgotten basic social graces.`

			`As Daemos guides you from the spaceport and you see a planet of anachronisms. In the high mountains, vast castles of medieval design house the pampered ultra-rich, living as if in a Victorian era. As you pass through the streets you notice all the comforts of the modern era concealed behind curtains: virtual reality booths, food-synthesizing devices, massive panel screens for tracking stocks, and the like. When you leave the wealthy areas, you see the poor living in cramped conditions no better than medieval serfs, using modern technology only in their workplaces.`
			`	Daemos isn't interested in any of that though; he rushes you on before you can fully take in the environment. You race through the cloud cities of the rich, beyond the factory towns, past the countryside, deep in a marsh, into a hidden temple, beneath a fake support column, and down to a subterranean room. In the center of the room, an impossibly old monk is meditating with his eyes closed. He hovers a half meter above the ground humming in an almost guttural tone. Within his hands is a book.`
			choice

			`	When Daemos approaches, the monk's eyes open, and he utters, "For the Seeker I do seek." He hands Daemos the book and then vanishes.`

			`	"We have the Paq wa'DIch. Next we seek the Paq cha'DIch."`
			`	This seemed too easy for a 60,000 credit mission. You suspect the next four books will be harder to get.`

			`Daemos takes you to a lecture about xenolinguistics, jointly presented by a young woman and a Quarg. It is a comparative study of seven different alien languages and five human languages. The research suggests that there may be similar origins of some words. If an alien race once existed, with a specific and bizarre anatomy, they may have touched all twelve languages.`
			`	After the lecture, the woman, Dr. Sophia Nance, runs over and hugs Daemos. "Dr. Demon! I've missed you."`
			`	"I haven't seen you since your defense," he says to her. "What way is that to treat your thesis advisor?"`
			`	"Sorry, Dr. Demon. The Quarg pulled me into this project, and I was too excited to refuse. I've been out of human space in a Quarg Wardragon for a while."`

			`	Daemos exclaims, "The Paq LoSDIch! You are an angel, Sophia. What about the symbols from Rand?"`
			`	"Bad news there, I'm afraid. Neither I nor the Quarg could translate them. We suspect they're not linguistic, but rather a map of sorts. The Quarg rotated them, and some looked almost like constellations. They say it may be a map, but if it is, it's for a younger era in this galaxy. Stars shift around pretty far after a few hundred millennia."`
