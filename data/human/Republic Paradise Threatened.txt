			`	You remain quiet and let her process what she is seeing. It takes a while and so you make yourself comfortable on a recliner in the corner, just answering the occasional question when she wants a bit more context.

			`	He nods once and retires to his bunk leaving you to plot the course to <system>, his words still echoing in your head.

You may land and make use of all of the spaceport facilities to refuel your ship, and we can offer you and your crew vouchers for the Starlink Casino and all of our fine bars and restaurants. The Syndicate has nothing to hide."`
			`	Your sigh of relief is short-lived, however, as Agent Satari is shaking his head.`

You take the time to perform some routine maintenance, and then you notice a ruby red laser light shining on one of the consoles. You freeze. Are they going to try to assassinate you?

			`You make it to the surface, and as you are coming in to land you can see that a small unit of Syndicated Security soldiers are setting up some defences. You screech over them and open up with your weapons, sending them sprawling in all directions.`
			`	Agent Satari retrieves a rifle from his bunk, and when he sees you looking at it he shrugs. "My technicians put it in when they were sweeping the ship."`
			`	As he surges through the hatch, moving faster than any human has a right to, you can't help but wonder what else those technicians were doing. After you drop Satari on Ada, you decide that you'll take some time to sweep the <ship> yourself.`
			`	There is the sound of gunfire from outside, and smoke surrounds the ship. Your sensors show four human heat signatures running and bent low but you can't tell which one is Satari. They all seem to be converging on the clear area in front of the mine, but it looks like none of them can see any of the others. You watch as one spins from cover, sweeping his weapon from side to side. Just then, one of the others jerks, lifts from the ground and then falls down dead, all in a flash.`
			`	A second person enters the clearing and then exchanges hand signals with the first. They both start moving in parallel, creeping slowly and each covering their own side. You look for the fourth person and find that he is now lying dead too. Before you can figure out what is going on, the two remaining figures turn and start firing behind them, but what they are aiming at is a mystery as nothing shows on your scope. First one and then the other expend their ammo and pause... and then beams of fire erupt from in front of them, taking both down before they have a chance to react.`
			`	When the smoke eventually clears you see Satari calmly toting the sample back towards the ship.`
			`	"Back to Ada, Captain," he says when he is back on board. You are not about to argue with him.`
