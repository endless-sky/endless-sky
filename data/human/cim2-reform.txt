			`Landing on <origin>, it's quite easy to mingle with the dockworkers and get talking. You learn about the working conditions, and how the company keeps people working through the breathless air and heavy loads, and gives little time for individual weakness. If a worker struggles too much, instead of rest and recovery the company typically dismisses them there and then, gives them a ticket off-world and nothing more, and hires new workers in their place: unaware of the struggles they will face. A union, they say, will force the company to give the workers more flexible time in case of medical difficulty, and stop them firing and re-hiring on a whim when they can find someone to work for less.`
			`	It seems like the dockworkers themselves are starting the union, and only those attached to a particular company involved in the running of the docks. But you do hear mention of a visitor who comes to advise from time to time. When you try to ask about him or her, you get no answer; instead they tell you about a union on <planet>, from which they're hoping to hire a union boss with experience to lead them. Maybe that's all they meant.`

			`You head out to find the contact the Furnace workers gave you for the union on <origin> which might help them out. The man you speak to is a leader but not the main boss in the union, and expounds to you its many virtues. But he's also honest about its shortcomings.`

Nothing big, just little things he could sell off on the streets or somewhere. But the union, instead of coming down hard on him, stood up to the company for him, said they couldn't fire or even demote him, that no one would work till they treated him right. We all had to stop and didn't get paid for three months while the union bosses negotiated with company management. We all got a 3% raise after that, so the union says it worked out good, but what do you do for three lost months?"`
			`	You ask him if people from this union have been visiting Furnace to advise them. "Not that I know of," he says; "they've been in contact but nothing has materialised. But..." he hesitates and lowers his voice. "There is this guy who comes here from time to time from off-world. Shady character, doesn't like to be remembered, but he talks with the bosses, gives them advice. I think he's telling the managers' dirty secrets so the bosses can blackmail them."`

			`	You thank the union leader for his time, and he gives you the contacts of a few other people to talk to. They have nothing much else to add, mostly being glad for the union, but one tells you if you want to know the dark side of the union, "you gotta talk with Dave, on Moonshake."`
			`	Finally, you sit down in a spaceport cafe, and wait to see if the Rolling Stone might show up. Would that you were so lucky. But you do meet one pilot who swears he sees a Falcon with that callsign heading south from here from time to time. Perhaps you could try looking in that direction.`

As to how - we don't know yet. But there is one who might: the second escapee. He's a scientist, involved in the nuclear bomb development. He must know."`

				`	"Can he prove it?"`

			`	Your speech raises cheers around the table, but Mary-Jane gives a note of warning.`
			`	"But," she says, "the Rebpublic Navy may turn their guns on the Syndicate, and many people here, just as innocent, will die. If we can round up all the extremists ourselves, and hand them, neatly packaged, to the Republic government, we can end this with peace, and keep the right to govern ourselves."`

			`	You explain. "See, parliament will come after the Syndciate for reparations. And the Free Worlds will hunt us down like tigers - which they have every right to do, except it means more death, more suffering. Without our intervention, the Free Worlds and Repbulic must come to a truce soon enough. And we will round up the extremists, purge them, and try them in our courts where they belong. The old leadership will quail. A new, righeous leadership will arise, one that values human life right down to the poorist and least able! And at last, with the true terrorists exposed and tried, we hand them over to the Republic government and make peace for the galaxy!"`
			`	As you speak, the circle of Amazons rises to your rally, and lets out whoops and cheers! A few, though, remain sombre.`
			`	"Captain," one speaks up. "After causing war and bombing cities, after profiting from the deaths of millions, do you think the Syndicate deserves to try its own? Should we not let those who have suffered most, decide? since we have the chance?"`

				`	"No, we have to solve this ourselves. Take responsibility with action."`
					goto stophim

			`	A lady from the back of the table, if there is a back, speaks up, and surprises everyone. She looks you in the eyes, and says, "Captain <first> <last>.

That is the way, sometimes."`
			choice
				`	"I understand. Then we will help the escapee."`
			label savehim
			`	"In which case," says Mary-Jane, "we have a daring plan of which you will be one part. You will need to save two tons of cargo space and one passenger berth, and after you report back to Downey about Peterson, you will set out on this plan.`
			`	"Stall Downey if you can. If he's on to the defector, try to make him look elsewhere. Then, regardless, you must go to Antipode. In a corner of the spaceport, well out of sight, the defector hid a large packet of evidence which you must pick up.`
			`	"So much for the easy part. Your quarry is escaping from Hippocrates, but before Downey and the other conspirators can send assassins or captors after him, we will shoot down his ship. For a moment, it will be disabled. At that point you, an innocent passer-by, must 'rescue' it - and bring the defector on board your ship. Fly him immediately and without landing to Alderamin, where you will rescue another disabled ship, depositing the defector and his precious cargo so he can escape. Finally, land and wait for our instructions. Do not go back to Downey straight away, because if anything becomes known, your life may be in danger.`
			`	"Godspeed, Captain."`

			`	And with that, your meeting is concluded, and you head back to report to Downey about Peterson... and brace yourself for this last, great climax of escapes. Who knows what it will bring.`
