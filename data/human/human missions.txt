			`	The inside of the racing complex is packed to capacity. Around you is a swarm of elbows and shoulders, jutting into you while you worm your way through the crowd. The sounds of rancorous conversation blend in with the pounding of rain on the roof as you glimpse a sight of the main attraction: a large, fenced-off oval. White lines inside the area form racing lanes, and arranged on the far side of the track are four cages covered with cloth.`

			`	A stagehand hops over the fence and towards the cages while the announcer continues. "Bleedbug is a veteran of the racing track. He's never taken the pole position, but perhaps this will be his lucky day!" The stagehand removes the covering of the innermost cage as a cheer rings out. The dog inside begins ferociously barking upon seeing the cacophony around him, but you can't help but notice how withered Bleedbug's body looks.`
			`	"Our second hound is one that you're all familiar with. He's an 18-time victor of the track," the voice pauses, "even if some of his wins were only by technicality." Already, a jeer is rising in the audience. The announcer says, "It's the hound that you don't want to beat: Doom." The booing reaches a peak as the stagehand takes the cover off of the largest cage of the lineup, revealing a gargantuan hound. Doom's body is finely defined, devoid of his competitor's malnutrition. As soon as he sets his eyes on Doom, Bleedbug stops yelling and retreats to the corner of his cage to whimpering. Pleased at his reputation, Doom lets out a thunderous bark.`

			`	"Now, our other two racers for the day are all-new." A murmur of anticipation sweeps through the audience. "Our first newcomer is a fine lady. Rumored to be from the wilderness of Zenith, can everyone put their hands together for Zinc!" The cover over the third cage is taken off to reveal a creature that is clearly not a dog. Her long, gray fur and piercing, golden eyes mark her as a far more graceful and feral beast, though underneath her coat, you spot atrophied muscles. Zinc initially stands unfazed by the crowd and the other dogs, calmly observing her surroundings. When Doom spots the wolf ignoring him, he begins to bark louder and louder, until she abruptly stares at him with an inscrutable expression.`
			`	"Our final contestant for the day is a most... unorthodox choice. The merchant who graciously donated her to us came with a most facinating story. She said that the hound comes from the Paradise Worlds, and her owner wanted the pet to have a luxury flight to her holiday home. Well, let's see if she can pay her way to victory here, folks." The audience snickers. "Now, give your best welcomes to Puny!" Puny is easily the frailest of the dogs, barely more than skin and bones. White whispers of hair clump around her head, chest, and ankles, and the bottom of her cage is wet. None of the other racers acknowledge her, but the crowd is rearing to volley a variety of curses and slurs at her, as though an actual Paradise World baron was in the cage. As you look at the poodle, you can't help but feel a strange sense of familiarity.`
			`	You feel your back get nudged, and turn to see a woman dressed in rags holding four buckets filled with credits. The names of the racers are crudely written on each of them. "Betting is 3,000 credits," she says unusually sweetly.`

			`	A red light on the ceiling turns on, and the audience shouts, "Three!" A second one lights up. "Two!" A third light, this time yellow, turns on. "One!"`
			`	A green light appears, and the crowd descends into chaos as the cage doors open.`
			`	The first to move is Bleedbug, desperate to get as far away from Doom as possible. Doom himself has his eyes set on a different target. As soon as the doors open, he rushes over the lane lines towards Zinc and bares his teeth for a bite. Anticipating this, Zinc dodges beneath the attack, and lunges in with her mouth open. Doom responds to the threat by lowering his head and bashing into her, and the two animals are quickly locked into a brutal mess of teeth and blood. The crowd goes wild at the spectacle unfolding before them as the brawl approaches your section of the fence.`

					goto live
				`	(Lie still.)`

Doom initially appears to have the upper hand, ramming himself into Zinc with impunity as she is sent sprawling. However, when Doom goes in for another tackle, Zinc dashes in and sinks her teeth into his neck. His roars of pain deminish into whimpers as blood spills readily on the complex's floor.`
			`	Suddenly, a gunshot rings out throughout the building. The two beasts fall over as the stagehand steps forward holding a shotgun. The crowd is left in silence for a moment, until they start to jeer and boo, angered by the unsatisfying end to the duel. The stagehand responds by pointing his gun up and firing again. "That's enough!" he yells. "If you freaks want your bloodsports, then go to the gladiator stadium, or a cockfighting ring. But this establishment will not support such degeneracy!" The crowd goes quiet, but out of the corner of your eye, you see some mean-faced figures reach into their pockets.`

Before you can react, you hear another gunshot and see a spurt of blood erupt from the man's temple. Almost instantly, the entire audience is up in arms as gunfire comes in from every direction. Acting instinctually, you duck down and crawl through the forest of legs towards the exit. Once there, you reach your hand up and push the door open before running out.`

			`	As you are conversing a bearded man and a rough-looking teenage boy enter the bar and begin looking around the room. "That's our captain," she says. "Please, you have to help us. There's a service tunnel that connects to the back entrance of the bar. We can escape through there."`
			`	You've heard of these service passageways: the most dangerous part of this lawless station, dimly lit and seldom traveled, except by drug addicts and prostitutes. This whole thing might just be a ruse to lure you into one, where they can attack you without anyone interfering. "No," says the boy, "if we head for the service tunnel, they'll be sure to notice us. Let's just stay at the table until they go away."`

			`	The boy stands up. "Wait ten seconds, then head to the tunnel," he says. He walks into the bathroom, which is right next to the back entrance that she pointed out. You wait for a few seconds, then stand up. "Don't run," says the girl. "Walk slowly. Pretend. You've had a bit too much to drink. We're headed out back to find some privacy." You don't dare look behind you to see if the men in the doorway are watching you.`
			`	Finally, you reach the back entrance, and she spins the wheel to unlock it. The hinges squeal, but it opens enough for you to squeeze through. You find yourselves in a narrow corridor lit only by flickering sodium lamps. In the yellow lamplight her face and hands look pale, jaundiced. The floor of the corridor is littered with beer bottles and discarded hypodermic needles. To one side of the door are several over-stuffed trash cans. As you step into the corridor, a rat scurries away into the darkness.`
			`	A few seconds later, watching through the open airlock, you see the boy walk out of the bathroom. He can't help stealing a quick glance towards the men in the doorway, after which he quickly ducks through the airlock and slams the door shut. "Run!" he whispers.`
			`	You begin running down the corridor, in the direction of your ship. You pass a man, slumped over in a corner; there is no time to see if he is dead, or just sleeping. In places the lights have gone out, and it is so dim that you can barely see the floor beneath you. Your footsteps pounding on the metal decking ring terribly loud up and down the empty hallway.`
			`	Eventually the passageway widens out into a maintenance room, full of humming equipment and large tanks. You duck behind one of them and listen for sounds of pursuit. "I think we're safe," says the boy. He walks over to another airlock door on the opposite wall and tugs it open. Light pours in, almost blinding at first. You are looking out into the rimway, the main passage in this ring of the station. Crowds of people are walking past, paying no attention to you. He glances quickly in both directions, then gestures for you to follow.`

			`	You wait at the table, pretending that you are busy placing a drink order. The men at the door do not leave. Instead, they step into the room and begin circling around the edge of it. "What berth is your ship in?" asks the boy. You tell him. "Wait ten seconds, then follow," he says. He stands up and walks through the door. The searchers glance at him as he leaves, but they must be looking for two people together, because they ignore him.`
			`	The searchers approach the bar and begin talking to one of the bartenders. You and the girl stand up. "Walk slowly," she hisses under her breath. "Saunter. Don't run." You put an arm around her shoulders and do your best to act like an ordinary bar patron headed home with a new friend after having a bit too much to drink. You don't dare to glance at the bar to see if you are being watched.`
			`	Finally you reach the door. You are in the rimway, the main passage in this ring of the station. It is crowded and brightly lit. You quicken your pace slightly and begin walking toward your ship, still afraid that if you break into a run, you will attract attention. The girl keeps glancing at the shop windows that you pass by: checking the reflection to see if anyone is following you. "They're leaving the bar," she says. And then, "They're walking in the other direction. I think we're safe."`
			`	You pass a narrow doorway, probably an entrance to one of the service tunnels. The boy is standing there, holding a gun by his side. His grim expression softens somewhat when he sees you approaching.`

The students have apparently just had some sort of science symposium, and poster boards are on display all along the walls. One of them catches your eye: the title is "Affordable Terraforming through Equilibrium Mapping."`
			`	The basic concept of the poster seems to be that instead of altering the climate of a planet through brute force, it ought to instead be feasible to use a properly timed nudge in the right direction to cause the climate to shift toward a new equilibrium point that supports greater biological complexity. This student seems to think that planets naturally "want" to grow more complex and support more life, but that they sometimes get "stuck" in less optimum states.`

			`Amy, Nolan, and the other two scientists tell you the known history of Tundra's climate. Millions of years ago, an asteroid impact or large volcanic eruption altered the planet's atmosphere. Now, the planet no longer retains enough heat from its host star in order to stay warm.`
			`	"Tundra's snow covered surface only exacerbates the problem, reflecting most of the star's light back into space," Nolan explains. "This means that we need to both alter the atmosphere in order for it to retain more heat and alter the surface in order for it to reflect less heat."`
			`	Amy rolls out a map of the entire planet onto the table. Different regions of the surface are color coded, and a large red spot in the planet's southern hemisphere sticks out to you.`
			`	"Tundra has very low volcanic activity, but seismic mapping has led us to this area." Amy circles the red spot with her finger. "Magma from the planet's mantle is building up under this area of the crust, which, lucky for us, is unusually thin. Still, it could be another ten thousand years before the magma builds up enough pressure under the surface to cause a supereruption, melting the snow around it and releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere that over time will raise the global temperatures."`

			`	"How exactly do you plan to do that?" the Tundra representative responds. "And what will happen to the people who live near that area?"`
			`	Nolan answers, "The people who live near the volcano will need to evacuate the area with all their belongings. The Republic should provide any assistance needed for the evacuation. As for how we will cause the volcano to erupt, we need something energetic enough to crack the planet's crust in the location of the volcano, releasing the pressure that the magma is causing to spark an eruption. That's where we bring in another asteroi--"`
			`	"No, no, no!" the Republic representative exclaims, cutting Nolan off mid-sentence. "The Republic will not gain a reputation for crashing asteroids into its own planets. The consequences of such an action could be disastrous should it go wrong! And in what way will this warm the planet when the resulting volcanic winter could last decades and only result in an even colder climate? Are you not even old enough to remember how a supereruption on Hope caused the evacuation of the entire planet? If the people of Tundra are this desperate to terraform their planet then normal techniques should be employed, none of this 'equilibrium mapping' nonsense."`
			`	"Sir," Amy speaks up with a stern tone of voice, "we have already been authorized by the Republic to undergo this terraforming experiment, so unless you have half a teraton of cheap explosives, we're going to need to use an asteroid. The volcanic winter can be easily avoided by having a fleet of freighters sweep the volcanic ash out of the atmosphere, meaning we'll get the benefits of the greenhouse gases without the detriments of volcanic ash reflecting Cebalrai's heat back into space. No one knew the volcano on Hope was going to erupt, but we can prepare for this eruption and take steps to mitigate the problems." Amy looks the representative straight in the eyes and smirks. "We're scientists, we have this handled."`
			`	The representative falls silent. After a moment of thinking, he says "Captain, I need you to take me to Parliament. I may be able to authorize the use of explosives that should suffice, but it may not be as cheap as Ms. Amy is hoping. We're not about to turn asteroids into our single solution for everything."`

Calls himself the Lokust, and his gang the Pestilance - names intentionally misspelled." He wrinkles his nose as if he's smelled something repulsive. "Given your history, I trust you're familiar with the Conservatory?" He doesn't wait for a response. "The shipment contained ancient Greek statues and was on its way there as part of a rotating exhibition, but our original transport was... unable to contend with the piracy threat in frontier regions. As a result, the shipment was 'diverted' to Greenrock, where the warlord in question is based. We want you to go to Greenrock and get these statues back any way you can, and then return with them back here. Our payment should cover the cost of any briberies you might have to make."`

Always jacking up his cut of the sale, threatening my customers, you get the idea. Not to mention my debts to him." The last part he says in a less bold tone. "What I'm saying is, I wouldn't mind if someone like you took him out. He's a real wacko, always going on about duels and other bull. If I were you, I'd challenge him to one. If he doesn't accept, call him a coward. That's sure to get him riled up." He wheezes in a way vaguely reminiscent of a laugh.

I'll supply the jetpacks, you supply the courage."`

Skymoot is host to many dangerous creatures, and these living myths hold a place at the top of that list.`

Suddenly, his expression darkens as he cocks his head, listening to an earpiece. "Listen up!" he yells.

As you're putting down in a clearing halfway up a mountain, you hear an otherworldly screech as your ship lurches violently to one side. You would have been thrown to the floor if you hadn't been strapped in.`
			`	"Look lively, lads!" shouts Karengo, the only person still standing. "Your chariot awaits!" He double-checks the jetpacks on the backs of each of the eight men, or "Dragonriders," as they creatively branded themselves during the first night of the voyage, then opens the side hatch and hurls the Dragonriders out the door before jumping himself.`

			`	The dragons of Skymoot you learned about on the "Xenofauna and Flora" channel were different from the dragons of mythology, but the beasts you see today aren't quite what you learned about, either. For one, the creatures flying outside your window are faster than you thought possible, or perhaps the ones on the show had been drugged to make them easier to film.`
			`	A quick survey of the scene shows that Karengo has tagged three dragons with some sort of harmless marker gun to make them easier to track. Eight of the Dragonriders, Karengo included, are chasing the largest one, which is missing part of a tooth and has blackened scales from where it hit your ship's shields. The last Dragonrider is nowhere in sight.`

			`	Karengo is riding a dragon, gripping the ridge of scales around its neck. The dragon frantically tries to get him off, but deft application of his jetpack keeps him on top of the beast for now. He lets out wild screams of triumph as they soar through the sky and at last you can understand the appeal of this whole expedition. Your admiration is cut short by two catastrophic crashes on either side of the ship and accompanying sirens. The dragons are trying to get through.`
			`	You activate your engines, and the ship takes off quickly enough to make you light-headed. "Get on board!" shouts one of the men over the external speakers as you position the ship just below Karengo and lower the shields. Scales bounce off the roof like diamonds. Karengo releases his grip on the dragon and free falls toward you, slowing at the last possible moment before dropping through the top hatch. You flick on the shields and hit the engines, hard. They respond enthusiastically, rocketing you away from the mountain and into the safety of patrolled airspace. From the cabin comes the sound of back-slapping and, surprisingly, a sob.`

As a young teen, they spent summers riding the latest horse mechs through the forest, looking for beehives to steal honey from. At age 19, she broke her ankle hoverboarding on a restricted mountain peak. Her father rescued her, avoiding the police to hike up with a medical kit. She talks about his wild birthday gifts to her each year, always a different piece of clothing with embedded AI that was just shy of what was allowed by law. As you watch, she shows how her shirt warms and constricts if it detects stress, mimicking a hug.`
			`	As you neared <system>, Riley told you about the last time she saw her father. He had become focused on his work - research into safe AI - and they hadn't seen each other for years. She had become a well-known DJ back on <origin> and had a break in her touring schedule, so she spent a good chunk of her savings meeting up with him on Memory. They spent most of a week together, reliving old times.`

			`	Riley, in turn, had always surrounded herself with music, and moved to <origin> to share her passion with other like-minded people. You talk about what it's like to call a ship your home, leaving behind everything you grew up knowing and embracing life as a starship captain.`
			`	Finally, her father lies back. "Well, thank you for making the trip out to see your old man. I... have to go now, I think. Don't forget about me, hear? And..." Church hesitates for a moment. "Whatever happens, please don't think ill of me. I will always love you."`

			`	"It... worked." His voice fizzles, and his tone is not the one you recognize from before. Riley's head whips around, and you reflexively move your hand toward your holstered gun. "Do not be alarmed. I have been working on a personal project for over a decade now. My mind was uploaded to the modified Core you are looking at. I had to say goodbye in case the procedure failed - I did not know if it would work. You cannot upload a mind while it's still alive. I tried that many times."

They talk for a few tentative minutes, at first about how he's feeling, before moving onto the memories that Church retained during the transfer. You begin to relax as the two interact when you realize that Church is retelling the story of how he evaded the police to fix Riley's ankle for the third time in a row.`
			`	Finally, she turns to you. "I'll admit that he doesn't sound as lively as he used to, but... how many people get a second chance to spend time with their father before he's gone? Thank you for bringing me out here, and for coming. I'll never forget your part in this. For now, I'd like to stay here. You go - I'll find my own way back." She seems genuinely happy.`
