			`	The inside of the racing complex is packed to capacity. Around you is a swarm of elbows and shoulders, jutting into you while you worm your way through the crowd. The sounds of rancorous conversation blend in with the pounding of rain on the roof as you glimpse a sight of the main attraction: a large, fenced-off oval. White lines inside the area form racing lanes, and arranged on the far side of the track are four cages covered with cloth.`

He's never taken the pole position, but perhaps this will be his lucky day!" The stagehand removes the covering of the innermost cage as a cheer rings out. The dog inside begins ferociously barking upon seeing the cacophony around him, but you can't help but notice how withered Bleedbug's body looks.`
			`	"Our second hound is one that you're all familiar with. He's an 18-time victor of the track," the voice pauses, "even if some of his wins were only by technicality." Already, a jeer is rising in the audience. The announcer says, "It's the hound that you don't want to beat: Doom." The booing reaches a peak as the stagehand takes the cover off of the largest cage of the lineup, revealing a gargantuan hound. Doom's body is finely defined, devoid of his competitor's malnutrition. As soon as he sets his eyes on Doom, Bleedbug stops yelling and retreats to the corner of his cage to whimpering. Pleased at his reputation, Doom lets out a thunderous bark.`

			`	"Now, our other two racers for the day are all-new." A murmur of anticipation sweeps through the audience. "Our first newcomer is a fine lady. Rumored to be from the wilderness of Zenith, can everyone put their hands together for Zinc!" The cover over the third cage is taken off to reveal a creature that is clearly not a dog. Her long, gray fur and piercing, golden eyes mark her as a far more graceful and feral beast, though underneath her coat, you spot atrophied muscles. Zinc initially stands unfazed by the crowd and the other dogs, calmly observing her surroundings. When Doom spots the wolf ignoring him, he begins to bark louder and louder, until she abruptly stares at him with an inscrutable expression.`
			`	"Our final contestant for the day is a most... unorthodox choice. The merchant who graciously donated her to us came with a most fascinating story. She said that the hound comes from the Paradise Worlds, and her owner wanted the pet to have a luxury flight to her holiday home. Well, let's see if she can pay her way to victory here, folks." The audience snickers. "Now, give your best welcomes to Puny!" Puny is easily the frailest of the dogs, barely more than skin and bones. White whispers of hair clump around her head, chest, and ankles, and the bottom of her cage is wet. None of the other racers acknowledge her, but the crowd is rearing to volley a variety of curses and slurs at her, as though an actual Paradise World baron was in the cage. As you look at the poodle, you can't help but feel a strange sense of familiarity.`
			`	You feel your back get nudged, and turn to see a woman dressed in rags holding four buckets filled with credits. The names of the racers are crudely written on each of them. "Betting is 3,000 credits," she says unusually sweetly.`

			`	A red light on the ceiling turns on, and the audience shouts, "Three!" A second one lights up. "Two!" A third light, this time yellow, turns on. "One!"`
			`	A green light appears, and the crowd descends into chaos as the cage doors open.`
			`	The first to move is Bleedbug, desperate to get as far away from Doom as possible. Doom himself has his eyes set on a different target. As soon as the doors open, he rushes over the lane lines towards Zinc and bares his teeth for a bite. Anticipating this, Zinc dodges beneath the attack, and lunges in with her mouth open. Doom responds to the threat by lowering his head and bashing into her, and the two animals are quickly locked into a brutal mess of teeth and blood. The crowd goes wild at the spectacle unfolding before them as the brawl approaches your section of the fence.`

However, when Doom goes in for another tackle, Zinc dashes in and sinks her teeth into his neck. His roars of pain diminish into whimpers as blood spills readily on the complex's floor.`
			`	Suddenly, a gunshot rings out throughout the building. The two beasts fall over as the stagehand steps forward holding a shotgun. The crowd is left in silence for a moment, until they start to jeer and boo, angered by the unsatisfying end to the duel. The stagehand responds by pointing his gun up and firing again. "That's enough!" he yells. "If you freaks want your bloodsports, then go to the gladiator stadium, or a cockfighting ring. But this establishment will not support such degeneracy!" The crowd goes quiet, but out of the corner of your eye, you see some mean-faced figures reach into their pockets.`

Before you can react, you hear another gunshot and see a spurt of blood erupt from the man's temple. Almost instantly, the entire audience is up in arms as gunfire comes in from every direction. Acting instinctually, you duck down and crawl through the forest of legs towards the exit. Once there, you reach your hand up and push the door open before running out.`

You bring Puny out from the taxi and ring the doorbell next to the gate. A minute later, a servant in a prim suit approaches. As soon as she sees him, Puny straightens up, holding her head high.`

			label enter
			`	The walk to the front of the house is arduous; you pass through several different stadium-sized gardens along the way, each dedicated to a different type of biome. Looking up at the sky, you see the remnants of clouds contort unnaturally around invisible pillars. As you follow the servant, he looks back at you repeatedly, checking that you're still following. You decide to look behind yourself, and see Puny eagerly following. She has somewhat recovered from her time on Freedom, but her body is still little more than skin and bone.`
			`	By the time you reach the mansion, your skin is slightly sunburnt. The servant walks up to the oddly tall door and presses the doorbell before moving to the side, hands folded behind his back. The bell is answered by a woman with a monstrous hairdo, barely able to fit in the doorway. Puny breaks into barking as soon as she sees her, but the woman ignores the barking and says, "Walters, who is this?"`
			`	"It's the captain who put out a description of Pookie, Madam Pemefrey," the servant replies.`
			`	When she hears this, Pemefrey's expression changes from annoyance to elation. "Really? Oh, I can't thank enough for this, dearie. How was it rescuing her? Did you have to barter with smugglers to track her down? Chase down kidnappers to free her? Battle with warlords for her safety?"`

			`	Walters walks up to his master, saying, "But Madam, how could this captain provide such an accurate description of how Pookie was abducted if-"`
			`	Pemefrey snaps her head to look back at her servant. "Walters! I thought you were on my side!" She holds her hands on her chest. "It would be such a shame if you ruined our friendship like this. Why, I wouldn't be able to bear to keep you around if you betrayed me like that."`
			`	Walters shoots a desperate glance at you while stepping back, but otherwise says nothing.`
			`	"Now, where was I... oh, right. You. Out. Now." She claps twice, jumping Walters to attention, who beckons you and Puny back to the gate of the mansion.`
			`	You slam the door of the taxi shut as Walters locks the gate. The return journey is somewhat somber, with even Puny wearing a frown. When you look back up from Puny, you find yourself in a far more humble region of <origin>. The grandiose manors built into impossible locations are far distant, replaced with a small suburban town that would not look out of place in the Dirt Belt were it not for the picturesque mountain ranges surrounding it.`
			`	While this town is less wealthy than the neighboring estates, it is still unmistakably on a Paradise World, with the street lamps scrubbed and polished to a wasteful degree. As you pass through the commercial district, your eyes catch a sign that says "Antette and Co. Animal Adoption Agency."`

			`You wander into one of several dimly lit, smoke-filled bars near your docking bay. Soon after you sit down, a pair of hooded figures stand up and begin moving toward you.

You can't see their faces.`

				decline
			
			label meet
			`	The hooded figures turn out to be a boy and a girl, both perhaps thirteen or fourteen years old. The bundle in the girl's arms is a baby. "Are you a captain?" the boy asks.`
			`	"Yes," you say.`
			`	"We're looking for passage off-world," he says. "My cousin works in the refineries on Arabia, and I'm hoping he can get me a job there."`

			`	They are silent for a long moment, looking down at the table. Finally, the boy says, "We're crew on a pirate ship, hardly better than slaves. The captain keeps our wages. We don't get paid anything unless they agree to let us go. But if you help us start a new life, we'll work hard and some day we'll pay you back."`

			label search
			`	As you are conversing a bearded man and a rough-looking teenage boy enter the bar and begin looking around the room. "That's our captain," she says. "Please, you have to help us. There's a service tunnel that connects to the back entrance of the bar. We can escape through there."`
			`	You've heard of these service passageways: the most dangerous part of this lawless station, dimly lit and seldom traveled, except by drug addicts and prostitutes. This whole thing might just be a ruse to lure you into one, where they can attack you without anyone interfering. "No," says the boy, "if we head for the service tunnel, they'll be sure to notice us. Let's just stay at the table until they go away."`
			`	The baby begins to cry, softly, and she bounces it gently, trying desperately to quiet it. "Shh. Shh." For the moment, it falls silent.`

			`	The boy stands up. "Wait ten seconds, then head to the tunnel," he says. He walks into the bathroom, which is right next to the back entrance that she pointed out. You wait for a few seconds, then stand up. "Don't run," says the girl. "Walk slowly. Pretend. You've had a bit too much to drink. We're headed out back to find some privacy." You don't dare look behind you to see if the men in the doorway are watching you.`
			`	Finally, you reach the back entrance, and she spins the wheel to unlock it. The hinges squeal, but it opens enough for you to squeeze through. You find yourselves in a narrow corridor lit only by flickering sodium lamps. In the yellow lamplight her face and hands look pale, jaundiced. The floor of the corridor is littered with beer bottles and discarded hypodermic needles. To one side of the door are several over-stuffed trash cans. As you step into the corridor, a rat scurries away into the darkness.`
			`	A few seconds later, watching through the open airlock, you see the boy walk out of the bathroom. He can't help stealing a quick glance towards the men in the doorway, after which he quickly ducks through the airlock and slams the door shut. "Run!" he whispers.`
			`	You begin running down the corridor, in the direction of your ship. You pass a man, slumped over in a corner; there is no time to see if he is dead, or just sleeping. In places the lights have gone out, and it is so dim that you can barely see the floor beneath you. Your footsteps pounding on the metal decking ring terribly loud up and down the empty hallway.`
			`	Eventually the passageway widens out into a maintenance room, full of humming equipment and large tanks. You duck behind one of them and listen for sounds of pursuit. "I think we're safe," says the boy. He walks over to another airlock door on the opposite wall and tugs it open. Light pours in, almost blinding at first. You are looking out into the rimway, the main passage in this ring of the station. Crowds of people are walking past, paying no attention to you. He glances quickly in both directions, then gestures for you to follow.`
				goto ship
			
			label outside
			`	You wait at the table, pretending that you are busy placing a drink order. The men at the door do not leave. Instead, they step into the room and begin circling around the edge of it. "What berth is your ship in?" asks the boy. You tell him. "Wait ten seconds, then follow," he says. He stands up and walks through the door. The searchers glance at him as he leaves, but they must be looking for two people together, because they ignore him.`
			`	The searchers approach the bar and begin talking to one of the bartenders. You and the girl stand up. "Walk slowly," she hisses under her breath. "Saunter. Don't run." You put an arm around her shoulders and do your best to act like an ordinary bar patron headed home with a new friend after having a bit too much to drink. You don't dare to glance at the bar to see if you are being watched.`
			`	Finally you reach the door. You are in the rimway, the main passage in this ring of the station. It is crowded and brightly lit. You quicken your pace slightly and begin walking toward your ship, still afraid that if you break into a run, you will attract attention. The girl keeps glancing at the shop windows that you pass by: checking the reflection to see if anyone is following you. "They're leaving the bar," she says. And then, "They're walking in the other direction. I think we're safe."`
			`	You pass a narrow doorway, probably an entrance to one of the service tunnels. The boy is standing there, holding a gun by his side. His grim expression softens somewhat when he sees you approaching.`
				goto ship

			`	You quickly make your way back to your ship. As soon as the door has closed behind you, all three of you breathe a sigh of relief. A second later, the baby begins to wail, loudly.

			`	"Please don't take too long leaving the station," adds Joe. "But, I think we'll be safe here until you're ready to leave. There's no way they can search all the ships at the dock."`

			`	Finally the band announces that their last song will be "Sad Archie." You've never heard of it, but the fans scream in approval. It's a slow, ballad-like song about a man named Archie who lives forever and is sad because the friends he makes all grow old and die. Archie has a pet dragon, and he builds a beautiful house for the dragon, but the dragon dies young. Archie is so sad seeing the dragon's house empty and gathering dust that he rents it out to some friends, but they fight with each other and trash the place. The story makes no sense, but some of the fans are wiping away tears as the song ends.`

The students have apparently just had some sort of science symposium, and poster boards are on display all along the walls. One of them catches your eye: the title is "Affordable Terraforming through Equilibrium Mapping."`
			`	The basic concept of the poster seems to be that instead of altering the climate of a planet through brute force, it ought to instead be feasible to use a properly timed nudge in the right direction to cause the climate to shift toward a new equilibrium point that supports greater biological complexity. This student seems to think that planets naturally "want" to grow more complex and support more life, but that they sometimes get "stuck" in less optimum states.`

			`	"Tundra's snow covered surface only exacerbates the problem, reflecting most of the star's light back into space," Nolan explains. "This means that we need to both alter the atmosphere in order for it to retain more heat and alter the surface in order for it to reflect less heat."`

			`	"Tundra has very low volcanic activity, but seismic mapping has led us to this area." Amy circles the red spot with her finger. "Magma from the planet's mantle is building up under this area of the crust, which, lucky for us, is unusually thin.

			`	Nolan answers, "The people who live near the volcano will need to evacuate the area with all their belongings. The Republic should provide any assistance needed for the evacuation. As for how we will cause the volcano to erupt, we need something energetic enough to crack the planet's crust in the location of the volcano, releasing the pressure that the magma is causing to spark an eruption. That's where we bring in another asteroi--"`
			`	"No, no, no!" the Republic representative exclaims, cutting Nolan off mid-sentence. "The Republic will not gain a reputation for crashing asteroids into its own planets. The consequences of such an action could be disastrous should it go wrong! And in what way will this warm the planet when the resulting volcanic winter could last decades and only result in an even colder climate? Are you not even old enough to remember how a supereruption on Hope caused the evacuation of the entire planet? If the people of Tundra are this desperate to terraform their planet then normal techniques should be employed, none of this 'equilibrium mapping' nonsense."`
			`	"Sir," Amy speaks up with a stern tone of voice, "we have already been authorized by the Republic to undergo this terraforming experiment, so unless you have half a teraton of cheap explosives, we're going to need to use an asteroid. The volcanic winter can be easily avoided by having a fleet of freighters sweep the volcanic ash out of the atmosphere, meaning we'll get the benefits of the greenhouse gases without the detriments of volcanic ash reflecting Cebalrai's heat back into space. No one knew the volcano on Hope was going to erupt, but we can prepare for this eruption and take steps to mitigate the problems." Amy looks the representative straight in the eyes and smirks. "We're scientists, we have this handled."`
			`	The representative falls silent. After a moment of thinking, he says "Captain, I need you to take me to Parliament.

		spaceport `The landing pads here are poured concrete, raised up slightly above the level of the desert to keep them from being buried in sand. A few workers are constantly driving brush sweepers across the unoccupied pads. The air is filled with sand particles and dust. Aside from the storage sheds, there are only two buildings, each with a large sign out front: "Labor" and "Trade."`
		spaceport `	For once, the spaceport is lively during Remembrance Day. It appears that more and more people are choosing to invite their family over to Rand to commemorate the day instead of traveling to another planet.`

		spaceport `The spaceport village consists of several large domes, which keep out the wind and driving snow; ships enter and exit the largest of the domes through a hatch that closes as soon as they have come through. Before the planet was terraformed, enough snow would pile up on top of one of the domes every decade or so that it became a danger of collapsing under its own weight; the locals would simply move out of that dome and build another one higher up on the snowpack, but the changing climate has reduced the amount of snow enough that the locals may never need to build another dome again.`

As you're putting down in a clearing halfway up a mountain, you hear an otherworldly screech as your ship lurches violently to one side. You would have been thrown to the floor if you hadn't been strapped in.`
			`	"Look lively, lads!" shouts Karengo, the only person still standing. "Your chariot awaits!" He double-checks the jetpacks on the backs of each of the eight men, or "Dragonriders," as they creatively branded themselves during the first night of the voyage, then opens the side hatch and hurls the Dragonriders out the door before jumping himself.`
			`	After the group has left, you land - this time undisturbed - and pull up every external camera you have to watch the action.`
			`	The dragons of Skymoot you learned about on the "Xenofauna and Flora" channel were different from the dragons of mythology, but the beasts you see today aren't quite what you learned about, either. For one, the creatures flying outside your window are faster than you thought possible, or perhaps the ones on the show had been drugged to make them easier to film.`
			`	A quick survey of the scene shows that Karengo has tagged three dragons with some sort of harmless marker gun to make them easier to track. Eight of the Dragonriders, Karengo included, are chasing the largest one, which is missing part of a tooth and has blackened scales from where it hit your ship's shields. The last Dragonrider is nowhere in sight.`
			`	Suddenly, proximity sensors go off on the starboard side and a camera shows something - or someone - bounce off your shield and tumble down the mountain.`

			`	Checking your camera feeds again, you see that object rolling down the hill is indeed a body. On another monitor, one of the Dragonriders is keeping just above a dragon, attempting to lower himself down. The dragon rolls in midair, its wing catching the man and sending him flying out of control. Fortunately, a leafy tree branch prevents any further physical harm. Meanwhile, a second dragon is pursuing another one of the Dragonriders.`

			`	You turn on the external speakers. "We are leaving," you blast to the survivors. "Get on board."`
			`	The defeated Dragonriders need no further encouragement. They beeline for the hatch and you flicker the shield to let them on deck, where they collapse, wide-eyed and panting. Karengo isn't with them. You turn to ask about him when a flicker of motion on a monitor catches your eye.`
			`	Karengo is riding a dragon, gripping the ridge of scales around its neck. The dragon frantically tries to get him off, but deft application of his jetpack keeps him on top of the beast for now. He lets out wild screams of triumph as they soar through the sky and at last you can understand the appeal of this whole expedition. Your admiration is cut short by two catastrophic crashes on either side of the ship and accompanying sirens. The dragons are trying to get through.`
			`	You activate your engines, and the ship takes off quickly enough to make you light-headed. "Get on board!" shouts one of the men over the external speakers as you position the ship just below Karengo and lower the shields. Scales bounce off the roof like diamonds. Karengo releases his grip on the dragon and free falls toward you, slowing at the last possible moment before dropping through the top hatch. You flick on the shields and hit the engines, hard. They respond enthusiastically, rocketing you away from the mountain and into the safety of patrolled airspace. From the cabin comes the sound of back-slapping and, surprisingly, a sob.`

			`	Later that day, you spot the Dragonriders at a corner table of the bar. The men, with the exception of Karengo, appear subdued.`
			`	"How goes it, <last>?" he asks. "We were just raising a glass to mission success - made possible by you, of course. Great flying, Captain." The bartender arrives with a round of drinks and Karengo raises one. "To the Dragonriders!" he says.`

			`	A crude sign behind him reads, "Dangerous Games - Karengo's Galactic Adventures."`

			`As before on Skymoot, Karengo guides you down to a landing spot far away from the local government. "Don't want no interruptions," he says.`
			`	Despite days of pressuring, you've been unable to get Karengo to tell you exactly what a quoijuu is, other than a slightly ominous "the biggest fish." He sends a file to your ship computer and grins. "Since it's too late to back out now, it's time to fill you in. Quoijuu aren't the only thing down there; you've also got scyllae, taniwhales, morgawrii, plus some hydrothermal vents, none of which will benefit us if we run into them."`
			`	"The good news is that there's a path to follow. The bad news is the only person to traverse the path was a bit of a nut. It's all in riddles, and I haven't been able to make heads or tails of them. Look them over and we'll follow your lead. And don't worry too much about it - what's the worst that could happen?"`

			`	The adventure seekers, who you've spent the trip getting to know, are getting ready. You watch a nearby pair, Daciana and Mussie, helping each other get their wetsuits on. Daciana catches your gaze and grins. "Bafta, mate. Safe sailing, see you on the other side." Karengo gives you a signal and you hurry back to the cockpit to fly out, away from safe shoals and over the watery abyss.`
			`	At your touch, the ship slowly sinks below the waves. As Karengo warned, most of your navigation systems quickly flash red warnings, then go offline; there is some unknown interference that overwhelms your ship's sensors, which were designed for space first and water second, or fifth, or not at all. Minutes tick by as the crew silently watches one of the few sensors still working.`
			`	EIGHT HUNDRED KILOPASCALS, the pressure gauge reads.`
			`	ONE THOUSAND KILOPASCALS.`
			`	ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED KILOPASCALS. A loud, metallic creak echoes through the ship and Mussie jumps, startled.`
			`	Karengo claps him on the back and gives him a signature grin. "Maybe <first> can keep you aboard after this in case they need anything from a high shelf!" Mussie smiles weakly, but his eyes don't leave the readout.`
			`	ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED KILOPASCALS. "This's it," Karengo announces, "Sub up! Let's see what there is to see. And <first>, keep it to passive sensors. Don't want to attract any undue attention." The ship smoothly descends into the mouth of a massive cave and your visibility, clouded by dark sulfide emissions from the hydrothermal vents at the floor, drops to less than eight meters. 6 personal subpods fan out behind you, their communication equipment syncing with yours to display them as blips on your screen.`

			`	On the way, she told you stories of her past, mostly of time shared with her father. As a young teen, they spent summers riding the latest horse mechs through the forest, looking for beehives to steal honey from. At age 19, she broke her ankle hoverboarding on a restricted mountain peak. Her father rescued her, avoiding the police to hike up with a medical kit. She talks about his wild birthday gifts to her each year, always a different piece of clothing with embedded AI that was just shy of what was allowed by law. As you watch, she shows how her shirt warms and constricts if it detects stress, mimicking a hug.`
			`	As you neared <system>, Riley told you about the last time she saw her father. He had become focused on his work - research into safe AI - and they hadn't seen each other for years. She had become a well-known DJ back on <origin> and had a break in her touring schedule, so she spent a good chunk of her savings meeting up with him on Memory. They spent most of a week together, reliving old times.`

			`	Her father is in a comfortable-looking medical cradle. Wires flow from it to the holoscreens around the room, showing vitals and other indecipherable information. Despite his wan, strained face and atrophied body, he raises his head to look at his daughter.`

			`	Finally, her father lies back. "Well, thank you for making the trip out to see your old man. I... have to go now, I think. Don't forget about me, hear? And..." Church hesitates for a moment. "Whatever happens, please don't think ill of me. I will always love you."`

			`	"It... worked." His voice fizzles, and his tone is not the one you recognize from before. Riley's head whips around, and you reflexively move your hand toward your holstered gun. "Do not be alarmed. I have been working on a personal project for over a decade now. My mind was uploaded to the modified Core you are looking at. I had to say goodbye in case the procedure failed - I did not know if it would work. You cannot upload a mind while it's still alive. I tried that many times."

They talk for a few tentative minutes, at first about how he's feeling, before moving onto the memories that Church retained during the transfer. You begin to relax as the two interact when you realize that Church is retelling the story of how he evaded the police to fix Riley's ankle for the third time in a row.`
			`	Finally, she turns to you. "I'll admit that he doesn't sound as lively as he used to, but... how many people get a second chance to spend time with their father before he's gone? Thank you for bringing me out here, and for coming. I'll never forget your part in this. For now, I'd like to stay here. You go - I'll find my own way back." She seems genuinely happy.`

			`	"'We at Megaparsec put the greatest attention into ensuring the safety and well-being of all our event participants and guests. Over the past forty-eight hours, our search teams have fully scanned the Volax, Cardax, Moktar, Bellatrix, and Menkar systems, and we are working in conjunction with the Republic and Syndicate to fully scour their territories belonging to the circuit as well. Ms. Renard's family can rest assured that if she's out there, we'll find her.'`
			`	"'Artemis Renard, daughter of terraforming magnates August and Louisa Renard, is perhaps best known for shattering the record for the Betelgeuse Classic in last year's race, crossing the finish line nearly fifteen minutes faster than the record set by Jackson Lee over twenty years ago. She was last seen flying her ship, the Moonfox, a white and red Lionheart Flivver with race registration B-168, in the Diphda system. Anyone with information regarding her whereabouts is encouraged to contact Syndicate or Navy authorities, as well as the Megaparsec Racing Events Commission, and may be entitled to monetary reward if such information leads to the retrieval of Ms. Renard or her ship.'"`

			label exhibition
			`	You reach the entrance to the exhibition soon enough. Inside is a large room filled with photos, videos, interviews, and other mixed media. They focus on three groups: the refugees of Hope, the Navy that saved them, and the Paradise Worlds that protested the evacuation. At one end of the warehouse, there is an installation with nearly a hundred original protest signs from rallies against the Dirt Belt and the Republic Navy; some of them are quite crude and tasteless. It's a strong rebuke to see those displayed here, so close to the Paradise Planets.`
			`	There are many, many photos, but one in particular catches your eye. It's of a woman standing in line to board a ship, a baby held at her hip and a look of sadness and determination on her face. The mother and child's cheeks, rosy and chapped, stand out in contrast with the cold blues in the background.`
			`	You head toward the exit, but as the automatic doors open, an arctic blast pummels into you from out of nowhere. Instead of <origin>'s spaceport, you find yourself in a life-sized 3D representation of the evacuation of Hope, complete with simulated climate effects and a projected horizon. There are huge Navy Cruisers and Auxiliaries in a snowy field near a small town gradually being covered by ash as hundreds of refugees slowly board. But what stands out most is the massive volcano erupting in the background.`
			`	"It's more of a collage than an exact rendering," says the young woman you met in line, having followed you all this way.

This Agreement is made in recognition of the Investor's intent to participate in the perpetual bond offering described herein, subject to all applicable terms, conditions, regulations, obligations, and supplementary materials explicitly or implicitly referenced throughout this document. By signing below, the Investor acknowledges receipt of this Agreement and agrees to the terms and conditions set forth herein.`
			`	ARTICLE I - SUMMARY OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF INVESTMENT: The Investor, by executing this Agreement, irrevocably agrees to remit an upfront and final payment of One Million (1,000,000) Credits to the Issuer as consideration for the bond offering of Three Hundred Sixty-Five Thousand (365,000) Credits per annum into perpetuity, payable daily to the Investor. The payment from the Investor to the Issuer shall be deemed fully earned and non-refundable by the Issuer, irrespective of any subsequent event, transaction failure, action, or inaction on the part of either Party. The Issuer, upon receipt of the aforementioned payment, will extend to the Investor the rights and benefits outlined in this Agreement, provided that the Investor complies with all current and future legal, regulatory, and administrative requirements imposed by the Issuer or relevant Republic, Syndicate, or Megaparsec bodies -- including, without limitation, the execution of ancillary documents, disclosures, or agreements not enumerated herein. Refusal to execute any such future instrument may result in the immediate forfeiture of the One Million (1,000,000) Credits, with no further payments required by the Investor beyond the initial investment.`
			`	The Investor acknowledges that they have been provided opportunity to review this Agreement in part or in full and may request a referral to legal counsel certified in Syndicate and Megaparsec regulatory investment law if desired at a standard rate. The Investor's signature below confirms their full and unconditional acceptance of this Agreement, including all foregoing terms and conditions, supplementary materials incorporated herein, and any future amendments or expansions thereto, which shall become immediately binding upon issuance by the Issuer.`

You don't need a complete understanding of every last word to recognize a golden opportunity when it's staring you in the face."`
			`	He gestures back to the stack of papers with a casual wave of his hand. "But if you insist on taking more time to think or read through it all, let me remind you -- this offer isn't going to wait forever. Opportunities like this are rare, and hesitation could mean missing out entirely. So, what's it going to be? Are you ready to grasp the deal of a lifetime, or are you going to let this one slip through your fingers?"`

However, both Syndicate and Megaparsec regulations require that any lawyer must be certified in both Syndicate and Megaparsec regulatory investment law, and pay the customary fees and dues. The required rate for such expertise is 795 credits per page reviewed, plus a base legal fee of 20,000 credits for document analysis. For this agreement, 101 pages, that comes out to 100,295 credits. A small price for peace of mind, wouldn't you say?"`
			`	Howard leans forward, lowering his voice slightly. "If you'd like, I can even recommend someone -- reliable, efficient. What do you say?"`

				`	"I'll just sign the investment."`
					goto signed
				`	"Thanks, I'd appreciate a recommendation."`

			`	"As it happens, I've taken the liberty of compiling a list for your convenience. These are the best in the business -- every single one fully certified and capable of handling a document of this caliber. Naturally, I'd recommend the first name on the list," he says, tapping the top entry, which is highlighted in green.`
			`	You glance down at the datapad. Each lawyer's availability is color-coded: green for immediate availability, yellow for waitlists stretching a few days, orange for weeks, and red for those not currently accepting new clients. The first lawyer, Howard's recommendation, is the only one highlighted in green.`
			`	"Efficient, thorough, and well-versed in Megaparsec investment structures," Howard continues, his tone smooth. "And, of course, ready to assist immediately. They can review the documents for you today for the modest sum of 100,295 credits. If peace of mind is what you're after, this is your best option. Alternatively, you can always trust in the integrity of this opportunity and move forward now. The choice is yours."`

			`	You select the green-highlighted lawyer on the datapad. Immediately, a floating head materializes on the screen, a sharp-looking individual with neatly combed hair and a cool, measured gaze. Their eyes dart side to side as they rapidly scan the document.`
			`	"Thank you for choosing my services," they say crisply. "This will just take a few minutes. Please hold."`
			`	They reappear a few moments later with a professional yet reassuring expression. "Thank you for waiting. I've reviewed the document, and here are the key points.`
			`	"First, the one million credits you're paying is completely non-refundable upon signing, even if the transaction falls through for any reason. Second, you may be required to sign additional documents or disclosures in the future. Refusing to do so could void the transaction and forfeit your one million credits. No further payments will be required beyond your initial investment. Lastly, standard boilerplate allows the agreement terms to be updated without notice for routine adjustments -- complying with new laws or a bond transfer. At worst, you might be asked to sign an additional disclosure at some point, but nothing that materially impacts your rights or obligations."`
			`	The lawyer's eyes meet yours through the screen. "It's thorough but not unusual. Happy to have been of service." The lawyer's floating head blinks off the datapad.`
			`	Howard, who has been waiting patiently, leans forward with his ever-polished smile. "Glad to see you got that legal review. Always a wise step for an investment of this magnitude," he says in a smooth and encouraging tone. He gestures to the stack of documents on the desk. "So, now that everything's in order, are you ready to sign and secure your investment?"`

			`Even amidst the mix of landing pads, hangars, and cranes, it's hard to miss the Megaparsec corporate office. After a short walk, you reach the towering building. The lobby is sleek and modern, filled with the quiet hum of efficiency. To your surprise the receptionist waves you on and you take an elevator up to the eighth floor, where Howard awaits.`
			`	The office reminds you of the one you were in on Hephaestus, though more understated. Howard's office is a modest yet modern space, featuring a smart desk, a few sleek chairs, and large windows overlooking the busy shipyards. You can't help noticing that, like the Hephaestus office, the minimalist decor hints more at style than substance.`
			`	"Glad you could make it," Howard says, extending his hand. "Apologies for the inconvenience, but it's better to discuss these matters away from potentially 'interested' parties." He motions for you to join him at one of the few sleek chairs in the center of the room.`

			`	Once settled, he leans back in his chair and gives you a serious look. "Tell me," he says, "are you familiar with Marauder ships?"`
			choice
				`	"Yes, of course."`
					goto ask
				`	"No, I can't say I am."`
			`	Howard raises an eyebrow. "Marauder ships are nasty pieces of work," he explains. "They're ships with numerous modifications - mostly with combat in mind. More shields, weapons, engines, and outfit space, with enough firepower to tear through a lot of defenses before anyone knows what hit them. They're often used by rogue groups that operate outside the law, preying on vulnerable targets."`
			label ask
			`	Howard pauses for a moment before continuing. "We at Megaparsec are interested in getting our hands on one. We want to study its design, see what makes it tick. We've received word that a Marauder ship was recently spotted in Oblate. I need you to track it down and disable it. Once it's crippled, our recovery team will handle the rest."`

				`	"What do you need me for? This sounds like something that the Syndicate could do themselves."`
				`	"No way, I'm done here."`
					decline
			`	Howard shifts a bit in his seat as he considers your question. "Normally we'd contract Lightspeed Logistics for this sort of job. They've got the expertise and resources to handle something like this cleanly." He pauses, choosing his words carefully. "But they lack the discretion. This particular Marauder ship belongs to a pirate who ran in the same circles as a number of Lightspeed contractors. If we sent them in, I'm concerned they might try to study the ship themselves, tip off the pirate, or worse, tip off others in the Syndicate that Megaparsec is making a move.`
			`	"That's where you come in. You're outside the usual network, and that gives us a layer of security. Take this job, and it stays between us. No one else needs to know Megaparsec is involved."`

				`	"Alright, I'm in."`
					goto accepting
				`	"And where does that promised investment opportunity fit in?"`
					goto "investing opportunity"
				`	"I'm still not interested."`
					decline
			label "investing opportunity"
			`	Howard's face brightens at the mention of the investment. "Ah, yes, the opportunity. It's much larger than the last deal you were part of, but the returns are still very competitive. You'll need at least ten or maybe twelve million credits to get in on this one."`
			`	He leans forward. "We're looking to fund a refueling station expansion at our logistics hub on Crossroads. We're between an aggressive option, a more conventional expansion, and a more conservative one."`
			`	Howard pauses, gauging your reaction before continuing. "All of the options have their merits, though investors usually prefer the one with the most returns. But the choice is yours if you're in. I'll make sure you get the full details once we're done with this little favor in Oblate."`
			choice
				`	"Alright, I'm in. Let's discuss it more after Oblate."`
					goto accepting
				`	"Why would a shipyard have refueling stations?"`
				`	"None of those options sound good to me. I'm out."`
					decline
			`	Howard clearly enjoys the opportunity to explain. "Megaparsec's shipyards here on Sunracer are our crown jewel, building nearly every one of our ships as well as our high performance aircraft and hovercraft. You cannot imagine the logistics required to get the countless capacitors and microchips from Tinker, Delta V's plasma engines from Solace - heck, we have a dedicated logistics hangar on Crossroads just for shipping the Quicksilver's Particle Cannons! Don't even get me started on the Mantas! Ada's a long ways away, but we sure love Lovelace Labs' products...`
			`	"Ahem. All that to say, refueling stations, while few, are part of our larger strategy in vertical integration. Refueling stations are the heart of our logistics network for bringing all the parts we need here and for getting various vehicles out of here to be sold across the Republic.`
			`	"There are, of course, ancillary benefits as well. For R&D, we can test the impact of different fuel mixtures on our ships prior to entering the market. For partnerships, we can include fueling rights in large-scale sales agreements with major corporations or government fleets. At our largest logistics hubs, the economies of scale even allow us to competitively offer refueling services solely to these high-volume operators, giving us a diversified revenue stream.`
			`	"In fact, the ancillary benefits are largely why there's such discretion in how the expansion will go. The aggressive and conservative fueling options both offer R&D and partnership benefits that are more than the project's direct returns."`
			choice
				`	"That makes sense. Let's discuss the deal more after Oblate."`
				`	"Thanks for the overview, but I'm still not interested. I'm out."`
					decline
			label accepting
			`	Howard nods with approval. "Excellent. The Marauder ship was last seen near Oblate, in the outer rim of that system. It's likely to be well armed, so stay sharp. Once you've disabled it, head back here and I'll make sure you're properly compensated."`

But don't let the term 'conventional' fool you, because Megaparsec rarely expands its refueling stations - this is the first time in over a decade. When we do, it's because we've identified a strategic location that will skyrocket profits. These opportunities are as rare as they come, and most investors never even hear about them. But you've proven yourself, and that's why you're getting a seat at the table."`
			`	He pauses, letting the weight of his words sink in. "Getting in on this is a once-in-a-lifetime chance.

There's a faint tension in the air, an unspoken acknowledgment that time is money, as the fueling process proceeds with the workers more focused on speed than safety.`

You slide into the comfortable seating and look out the window as the dry, ugly landscape of Rand passes you by. From time to time you see a strip mine or a camp of workers' barracks, but rarely anything else. Behind your vehicle there is a huge plume of half-frozen dust. Apparently low gravity and thin topsoil is a terrible combination.`
			`	After an hour of driving you notice the landscape suddenly shift. The first tendrils of greenery invade the otherwise brown-yellow desert. Upon closer inspection, the green plants are accompanied by all manner of technology to help and promote their growth. Money, it seems, is turning just a little bit of this parched place green.`
			`	Beyond the suddenly green hills sits a huge sprawling complex. You recognize a few massive structures outside the building as artificial gravity drives; the same sort of drives ships use to maintain gravity onboard, but for an entire estate.`

The governor's mansion, and a few other important buildings and housing complexes, use artificial gravity drives to make things more manageable for us hard-working 'servants of the state.'" The way she says "servants of the state" makes it sound like some kind of inside joke. She turns away from you before you have a chance to say anything else.`

			label nothing
			`	The vehicle pulls up to a grandiose entrance near the center of the huge structure. An attendant opens the door, and you're ushered outside the vehicle.`
			`	Regina does not get out. She smiles politely through the opened door. "Only you were invited to enter the Governor's Mansion. I am afraid this as far as I am allowed to go. Take care, Captain <last>. It truly was an honor meeting you."`
			`	With that the door shuts, and a few moments later the black vehicle departs, leaving you and the attendant at the mansion's entrance.`
			`	The attendant bows deeply. "Please, Captain <last>. If you would follow me." He turns and heads into the building.`
			choice
				`	(Follow the attendant.)`

			`	Upon entering the mansion you feel your weight shift. It's still a little less than 1 g, but close. There's a young well-dressed woman, the same who you saw in your message, waiting for you inside. The attendant leaves you with her.`
			`	The woman smiles pleasantly. "We are all so pleased you could make it here. Forgive me for not meeting you outside, but I find the gravity of this world distressing. I am Wynnafrith, the governor's executive assistant, and will be pleased to announce that you are here.`
			`	Wynnafrith says a few quiet words into an intercom, and a door behind her opens. "The Governor is ready for you."`
			choice
				`	(Enter the room.)`

			`	You enter a large, richly furnished room. At the center of the room is an imposing desk, with a slightly graying man seated behind it. There is something immediately familiar about his face.`
			`	"Ah, Captain <last>. At last we can meet face to face, and I can thank you properly." The Governor stands. "You may not remember me, for it has been some years since you last laid eyes on me, and," the governor gestures to himself, "I looked quite different back then."`
			`	"I was a stowaway on your ship. You found me in a food crate, and you took me here. I'm Timothy Radrickson, Governor Timothy Radrickson now."`
			`	Timothy sits back down and indicates that you should do the same. "It took me some time. But through some good decisions, and quite a bit of luck, I've been able to claw my way to a level of respectability and wealth. I've really been able to make something of myself."`
			`	His face opens up into a large grin. "Then again, compared to what you've done in all this time, my successes hardly register. Still, as meager as they may be, I owe it all to you and your kind gesture. Which is why I've invited you here, to thank you and pay you back properly."`
			`	Timothy taps a display on his desk. "First, I am transferring 125,000 credits to your account to pay you back for the crate of food, the fuel, and the additional expenses of taking care of me on your ship; plus interest, of course."`
			choice
				`	(Accept the money.)`
					goto "money accept"
				`	(Refuse the money.)`

			label "money accept"
			`	Timothy pulls out a bottle beneath his desk and two glass cups. "To celebrate our reunion."`
			`	He pours the brown liquid in the cups and pushes one to you. "Things have gone well for me, and are only going to get better from here on out."`
			`	He takes a sip and says, "We've just launched our largest freighter fleet to date." He sits back in his desk, relaxed, and gets a dreamy look in his eyes. "When it returns from Wayfarer, the government of Rand will finally have enough credits to make some real changes around here. Give something back to the working man."`
			choice
				`	"Congratulations Timothy. You're really outdone yourself."`
				`	(Take a sip from my glass.)`

				`	"You're proof that hard work is all it takes to succeed. I don't know how you can stand living on a world filled with lazy workers all demanding hand outs."`

			`	His eyes refocus on you. "You'd be proud, <first>. I am going to make a real difference here..."`
			`	Timothy is suddenly interrupted by an incessant notification coming from his desk. He glowers and says, "Excuse me for a moment, <last>," sits up straight, turns on his ear piece and answers the call.`
			`	"What?!" He nearly shouts after ten seconds of listening, followed by "How can that be?" and finally, "What about the Navy or the militias, where are they!?" His face goes from red to white as the color drains out of him, and he finishes the call with a few unhappy "uh huhs" before finally hanging up.`
			`	"Never mind." He rubs his forehead and closes his eyes before saying, "Rand's future is gone. It's just been hijacked by marauders."`
			`	He stands up and starts pacing around the room. "I'm sorry. We're going to have to cut this reunion short. Our freighter fleet, filled to the brim with all of Rand's mineral wealth, has been taken. To make matters worse, in order to make this shipment happen I had to hire a private outfit from the Deep, and neither the Navy nor the Free Worlds militias are going to intervene on their behalf. Which means this entire world, and myself, are finished."`
			`	He collapses back in his chair with his head in his hands. "I'm sorry. There will be a car waiting for you at the entrance."`

			`	Timothy jerks up to look at you, his eyes wide and searching. "Really? I... Rand... we don't have anything left to pay you, and who knows how dangerous those marauders are... but we'll take any help we can get if you're up for it."`

There was a report from some local merchants who sighted a large group of marauders in Lesath escorting a freighter fleet in merchant colors. They tracked their movements to Shaula."`
			`	He frowns as he considers something, then says, "If you hurry, you might be able to get there before they've had time to move the goods or deal with their crews... no more than a week at most... but who knows, they're pirates." Timothy hits a few more buttons on his display screen, then he continues, "I've just sent your ship the tracking beacon for our fleet. It should help you find them once you're in Greenrock's atmosphere."`

			`Instead of Regina you are met by Timothy's executive secretary, Wynnafrith. She is clearly a little uncomfortable in Rand's low gravity, but is doing her best to push through it.`
			`	"Captain <last>! You're the talk of the world! The savior of Rand." She gives you an open and earnest smile.`
			`	"I've been sent by the Governor to drive you straight to his estate. Please come with me."`
			choice
				`	(Go to the Governor's Mansion.)`

			`	In the evening the passing landscape is too dark to see, so instead you focus on the glittering stars overhead. Eventually your ride slows as you seem to be caught up in traffic near the Governor's mansion. As you approach you pass streets crowded with parked personal vehicles.`
			`	The mansion is lit up with dozens of flood lights, and brimming with fabulously dressed people. Wynnafrith turns her vehicle over to a valet and opens your door to let you out.`
			`	She gives you a mischievous grin. "Apologies, Captain <last>. I forgot to mention the Governor was holding a little get-together. Please follow me."`
			choice
				`	(Follow Wynnafrith.)`
			`	She leads you through an army of valets, waiters, and attendants as you weave in and out of the various rooms and halls. Many of the guests appear to recognize you and offer you earnest congratulations. Eventually you are ushered to the table of honor where Wynnafrith introduces you to a half dozen company bosses, senior executives, political operatives, and the like. You notice Regina here as well, but she is seated at a table in the back, on the fringes of the upper crust of society.`
			`	Not long after being seated Governor Timothy appears, and after making small talk with many of the gathered illuminaries, sits beside you. "I have something to admit," he says quietly to you.`
			`	He gives you a sheepish smile and says, "This is a celebration in your honor, Hero of Rand."`
			choice
				`	"Hero of Rand?"`
				`	"What do you mean?"`
				`	"So you lied to me."`
			`	He shrugs. "I just thought it would be more fun this way. Who doesn't like surprises?"`
			`	"Without you the entire planet would have defaulted. Our creditors were circling like vultures eager to assume ownership of all our production capabilities, and turn the population into indentured servants. The whole world would have been their debtor's prison."`
			`	He pauses to consider his words. "I mean, the language they would have used would be different, but that is what it would have amounted to. But you saved us, and more than that, we're now quite a bit more wealthy than we were before."`
			`	Timothy snatches a glass and holds it up to you and says, "From ruin to riches! The Hero of Rand!"`
			`	A few others lift their glasses as well. They clink and Timothy then gulps the whole thing down, and after that the group breaks apart into smaller conversations.`
			`	Eventually, the party settles down and Timothy leaves you to step up to the podium. He launches into a speech highlighting your career. The great changes you have wrought, the battles you have won, the legends of your ship. The crowd eats it all up, many having heard of some, or all of these exploits. But then Timothy takes a more somber note. He talks quietly about the troubles on his old world. On how as a starving, homeless fugitive he had recklessly hidden aboard the first ship he could find. How you had found him, half dead, in an empty crate. And how, instead of tossing him out an airlock, or dropping off at the nearest world, you took him where he asked. How you took care of him, and how through your generosity, you had given him a second chance.`
			`	Light reflects off the tears that cling to Timothy's eyes as he tells the assembled crowd that, for him, that was your greatest moment, your most heroic action, that nothing you've done, or ever will do, compares to that simple act of mercy. And that this, to him, alone, is what makes you great.`
			`	From here his story shifts to your selfless offer to help save Rand, even though they could promise no reward, of your stunning victory over Greenrock, and your daring liberation of the fleet on the ground. He ends with you triumphant, and Rand saved.`
			`	The assembled guests stand, clap and cheer. They look at you, at your seat of honor, and raise their glasses to you. Eventually as the cheers and hoots die down, the Governor declares you a Hero of Rand, and thanks you for your service.`

But, then you talk about how poor, dirty, and shabby things are outside of this mansion, with its fake gravity, and fake greenery. You declare you want no praise from them, no flattery, and no accolades. There are a million Heroes of Rand, outside these baroque walls, toiling away in dirty, dangerous mines. All for what? So that these company-bosses and fat-cat politicians can pat each other on the back and live in obscene luxury in the middle of a squalid world? You rail, you rant, you break them down, and you dare them to do something about it. Instead of angry shouts, or acidic boos, you are met with condescending indifference. Even the serving staff look bored, as though they've heard it all before. Finally, your speech ends with not with applause, or even angry glares, but with the sounds of numerous muffled conversations. You've been forgotten, and ignored.`

The Republic Navy made it easy. Enter their ships and be shipped off to paradise, to live as nobodies at the sufferance of strangers.`
	`	"But we were House Drifa. More than anyone else we built this world, and we would not abandon it to be someone else's dredges. My father bought supplies, equipment, necessities from the Navy. Enough so that me, my brother, and my mother could survive here."`
	`	She pauses, as though unsure she wants to continue; then finally, in a less firm voice: "And then my father left. He said that dozens of worlds, worse off than ours, were terraformed every day. He said all they needed was a little convincing, and that he would come back with the support to terraform, and save, Hope. And then... he never came back."`
	`	Ildico sighs. "A treasure hunter killed my brother a few years back. My mother... she is also dead, and I am starving. I have no way to contact anyone else, and no one else is left.`

When the form prompts you for your address, you scramble out of the room to research what spaceship captains should fill out in such cases. After many contradicting forums and blatantly outdated government websites, you return and put in the best answer you can think of. Then the form specifically requires you to input the institution you studied at, here on <origin>. Again you set to look for answers on how to respond when you are not even from the planet this form is from. After a few more questions, you start to zone out and just automatically input whatever seems least likely to get the form rejected, based on online tips and nebulous descriptions from government pages.`

			`	As it turns out, your bank account is not compatible with the due process the forms here are a part of. You download an application to open your very own account on one of the local banks, after checking with the receptionist that this one is compatible. After a few more minutes (and a great many attempts at fitting your face in a camera shot for a mandatory facial recognition step) your new bank details are ready and filled in the forms, which you turn over with haste. Surely it must be ending soon.`

			`	"Obviously, the details are confidential, but in very broad generalities, he wanted me to warm up a freezing world."`
			`	Ildico doesn't blink; on second thought, you're not sure you've ever seen her blink. "Hope. Yes, and could you warm it?"`
			`	Ian laughs. "Oh, of course, a job like that would have been quite simple."`
			`	"Then why didn't you?" The tension is obvious in Ildico's voice.`
			`	Ian shrugs. "Though he could afford it, there were other concerns."`
			`	Ildico steps forward and looms over Ian like an angry shadow. It appears that it is taking all of her willpower to keep her from ripping this man apart. "Concerns?"`
			`	"Y-yes. I don't know the specifics. You have to understand, here at the Academy it's not just about money. It's about politics, and power. I am just a Second Degree Terraformer, and after the initial meeting I wasn't privy to the details. But someone, or some government or corporation didn't want it. If you want to know more you'll have to ask him yourself."`
			`	Ildico seems to deflate. "Ask him? Is... is he here?"`
			`	The terraformer shakes his head. "Oh, no. He doesn't work for the Academy. But after the rejection he went to the heart of the Republic, I assume to find out why. He now works for them. I see his name from time to time. Just head to the Republic's main office for the Department of Migration, which is located on Chiron."`
			`	Without saying another word, Ildico turns and leaves. You thank Ian for his help and follow her out.`

			`It's easy to imagine Earth once looked and felt much like Chiron does today. A vibrant world, full of engaged and motivated people, all in a hurry to change the universe - or at least, to run it.`

He tried to make me his wife. And mother? She cracked long before that. An entitled debutante like her had no chance in that hellhole, and I? I needed to eat."`

			`After waiting two hours in the spaceport's bar, Liam and Sophie come back with unexpectedly broad smiles on their faces. You flag them down from your table and they eagerly take a seat.`

			`	Sophie smiles at her brother. "Of course, Liam just can't wait to get started!" She turns back to you. "Maybe I should start with who our father was. We didn't get to know him very well - he came home only occasionally. Don't get me wrong, our parents weren't fighting, but he had this passion: he couldn't stay in one place for very long. He was a captain, not unlike you, and he was restless to explore even the furthest parts of the galaxy. We believe he traveled further than most human captains; sometimes he brought small items back home that nobody could explain."`
			`	She pauses for a moment. "Anyway, his testament says he left something behind for us on <planet>, in <system>. He said that he wouldn't make it easy though; he loved fantasy books, and there's always an air of mystery to those stories. He told us of a few systems we should visit before we go to Prime. It'll be like one last fantasy story from Dad!`
			`	"Of course, it would be much easier if we could go directly to Prime, but we want to respect our father's last will." She looks directly at you now. "And that is why we need your help. Could you help us again and take us through all these systems?"`

It is only when you have all stepped out into Prime's spaceport that Sophie says, "Captain <last>, you've helped us immensely, and we can't thank you enough for bringing us all across the galaxy! But we have one last request. Both of us think that you should come with us to see what our father left behind. Do you want to see it?"`

			`	All three of you walk around the spaceport district for some time. Coming into a giant plaza, you see one of the newest models from Betelgeuse, a Behemoth, on display in the center. The massive freighter with its many turret emplacements towers over even the plaza, an obvious showcase of Prime's leading shipbuilding industry.`
			`	Liam's face brightens as if he just understood something. "I think our father chose this planet because he was always a fan of Betelgeuse ships. Before he went on his adventures he used to be a test pilot for the shipyard."`
			`	Sophie nods. "Right! And once he was allowed to keep one of their experimental models as a gift for being one of their most productive pilots. Betelgeuse almost wouldn't let him go when he wanted to leave and explore the galaxy! But we're running out of time. Shall we go to the mountain now?"`

			`	You take a maglev from the spaceport and get a tour through some of the regions of Prime's mainland; on the way you pass through the fields of New Toulouse, where the majority of the local agricultural industry is located, and into the New Pyrenees hills. After an hour you and the siblings step off at a provincial city. Although Betelgeuse starts to recede behind the horizon, you can see a small mountain that stands alone against the rest of the landscape.`
			label mountain
			`	Liam, with the help of the map, guides all of you to the base of the mountain, where you come across a flat wall embedded into a small cavern in its side. "There's a phrase our father left in the instructions: 'Edr- i fen,'" he explains, a little embarrassed at his inability to pronounce it. "I don't know what it means, but I'm certain it has something to do with one of these fantasy novels he used to read."`
			choice
				`	"Sounds funny, but let's say it."`
				`	"You've got a strange dad, but I like his sense of humor."`
			`	Sophie counts to three, and then all of you shout out the phrase together.`
			`	Suddenly, a bright blue line appears on the wall. For a second, a flash blinds you and there is a dim hissing noise, like the sound of rock being cut by a laser. As you look back, the line forms into a blue rectangle, the shape rapidly expanding down the wall. When it reaches the ground, the shape has become large enough to cover a human.`
			`	For a moment, nothing happens, and the siblings are too stunned to do anything. The rectangle starts flashing between different hues of blue, until the whole section and the stone it covered disappears suddenly to leave behind a cavity in the wall. "I could have sworn the stone was real," Liam says under his breath.`
			choice
				`	"Well, this is a real adventure. Let's go!"`
					goto enter
				`	"We don't know what's inside there. Be careful."`
			`	"Well, now that you mention it, I recently bought a small camera drone," Liam responds. "We can use it to scout out the hallway. It's only in infrared, so we won't see too many details," he adds. Liam starts the drone and guides it using a small remote control with integrated display. After some time, the drone flies back out and he tells you, "I think it is safe. We can go."`
			label enter
			`	In single file, the three of you enter the hallway behind the opening. Strangely, the stone walls are perfectly smooth, and the light that guides you through seems to come out of nowhere. "To use alien technology for something like this," Sophie laughs, "that's totally our dad."`
			`	For a long while the three of you continue through the stone hallway, the light following your movements, until it opens up into a dome-shaped room brilliantly bathed in blue light. On the walls, there are all manner of alien artifacts lined up next to each other, but at the center of the room there is a pedestal with a sword inserted into it. A small tablet stands in a socket in front of it.`

				`	(Go up to the sword.)`
					goto "sword scene"
				`	(Take a look around first.)`
			`	You walk around to the right of the dome to the collection of alien objects, all steel in color and rather blocky. "Wow, he must have always brought us back the small items from his expeditions, because these artifacts over here are huge!" Liam exclaims from another part of the dome. "How did he even move all these here?"`
			`	Now that Liam points it out, many of the larger artifacts over his way look similar to the Sheragi technology you studied with Albert Foster.`

			`			"My dear children. The galaxy runs far and wide, and I have traveled many places, more than most in many lifetimes. I have seen many worlds, both alien and human, too. It was my life's work.`
			`			"But still, there were many paths I did not take, many rocks I have left unturned, and many worlds I have not yet landed on. And I suspect that you will have read this before those destinations were reached. Well, I have arrived at a different destination now, the only one nobody can understand, but everybody reaches eventually. Do not fear for me.`
			`			"This room you are in now is the culmination of all my work. I hope you understand that it was for your sake that I kept these a secret. My journey was long and unforgiving, but it was my life. I hope you continue that journey, to understand the universe a little better.`
			`			"Your father."`
			`	Understanding the personal nature of the message, you leave the two alone for a bit, walking around and looking at the artifacts on the left of the dome.`
			`	After some time, the siblings call you back. Sophie says, "Captain <last>, Liam and I have thought about this, and we think that we would never be able to live up to our father's expectations if we kept this sword. We can study all these artifacts and understand more about the universe through them, but we cannot study this one. To understand its abilities, it needs to be used.`
			`	"This sword was always at our father's side, and it has been many places. Take it to many more." She pulls the sword from the pedestal, and gives it one last look before handing over it to you. "It is yours now."`

			`	Liam adds, "We will always be grateful for your help with our father's will. We never imagined that we would come so far, and we would have never done it without you. It means so much to us. We wish you well through the stars, Captain <last>."`
