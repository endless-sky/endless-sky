			`	The inside of the racing complex is packed to capacity. Around you is a swarm of elbows and shoulders, jutting into you while you worm your way through the crowd. The sounds of rancorous conversation blend in with the pounding of rain on the roof as you glimpse a sight of the main attraction: a large, fenced-off oval. White lines inside the area form racing lanes, and arranged on the far side of the track are four cages covered with cloth.`

He's never taken the pole position, but perhaps this will be his lucky day!" The stagehand removes the covering of the innermost cage as a cheer rings out. The dog inside begins ferociously barking upon seeing the cacophony around him, but you can't help but notice how withered Bleedbug's body looks.`
			`	"Our second hound is one that you're all familiar with. He's an 18-time victor of the track," the voice pauses, "even if some of his wins were only by technicality." Already, a jeer is rising in the audience. The announcer says, "It's the hound that you don't want to beat: Doom." The booing reaches a peak as the stagehand takes the cover off of the largest cage of the lineup, revealing a gargantuan hound. Doom's body is finely defined, devoid of his competitor's malnutrition. As soon as he sets his eyes on Doom, Bleedbug stops yelling and retreats to the corner of his cage to whimpering. Pleased at his reputation, Doom lets out a thunderous bark.`

			`	"Now, our other two racers for the day are all-new." A murmur of anticipation sweeps through the audience. "Our first newcomer is a fine lady. Rumored to be from the wilderness of Zenith, can everyone put their hands together for Zinc!" The cover over the third cage is taken off to reveal a creature that is clearly not a dog. Her long, gray fur and piercing, golden eyes mark her as a far more graceful and feral beast, though underneath her coat, you spot atrophied muscles. Zinc initially stands unfazed by the crowd and the other dogs, calmly observing her surroundings. When Doom spots the wolf ignoring him, he begins to bark louder and louder, until she abruptly stares at him with an inscrutable expression.`
			`	"Our final contestant for the day is a most... unorthodox choice. The merchant who graciously donated her to us came with a most fascinating story. She said that the hound comes from the Paradise Worlds, and her owner wanted the pet to have a luxury flight to her holiday home. Well, let's see if she can pay her way to victory here, folks." The audience snickers. "Now, give your best welcomes to Puny!" Puny is easily the frailest of the dogs, barely more than skin and bones. White whispers of hair clump around her head, chest, and ankles, and the bottom of her cage is wet. None of the other racers acknowledge her, but the crowd is rearing to volley a variety of curses and slurs at her, as though an actual Paradise World baron was in the cage. As you look at the poodle, you can't help but feel a strange sense of familiarity.`
			`	You feel your back get nudged, and turn to see a woman dressed in rags holding four buckets filled with credits. The names of the racers are crudely written on each of them. "Betting is 3,000 credits," she says unusually sweetly.`

			`	A red light on the ceiling turns on, and the audience shouts, "Three!" A second one lights up. "Two!" A third light, this time yellow, turns on. "One!"`
			`	A green light appears, and the crowd descends into chaos as the cage doors open.`
			`	The first to move is Bleedbug, desperate to get as far away from Doom as possible. Doom himself has his eyes set on a different target. As soon as the doors open, he rushes over the lane lines towards Zinc and bares his teeth for a bite. Anticipating this, Zinc dodges beneath the attack, and lunges in with her mouth open. Doom responds to the threat by lowering his head and bashing into her, and the two animals are quickly locked into a brutal mess of teeth and blood. The crowd goes wild at the spectacle unfolding before them as the brawl approaches your section of the fence.`

However, when Doom goes in for another tackle, Zinc dashes in and sinks her teeth into his neck. His roars of pain diminish into whimpers as blood spills readily on the complex's floor.`
			`	Suddenly, a gunshot rings out throughout the building. The two beasts fall over as the stagehand steps forward holding a shotgun. The crowd is left in silence for a moment, until they start to jeer and boo, angered by the unsatisfying end to the duel. The stagehand responds by pointing his gun up and firing again. "That's enough!" he yells. "If you freaks want your bloodsports, then go to the gladiator stadium, or a cockfighting ring. But this establishment will not support such degeneracy!"

Looking up at the sky, you see the remnants of clouds contort unnaturally around invisible pillars. As you follow the servant, he looks back at you repeatedly, checking that you're still following. You decide to look behind yourself, and see Puny eagerly following. She has somewhat recovered from her time on Freedom, but her body is still little more than skin and bone.`
			`	By the time you reach the mansion, your skin is slightly sunburnt. The servant walks up to the oddly tall door and presses the doorbell before moving to the side, hands folded behind his back. The bell is answered by a woman with a monstrous hairdo, barely able to fit in the doorway. Puny breaks into barking as soon as she sees her, but the woman ignores the barking and says, "Walters, who is this?"`
			`	"It's the captain who put out a description of Pookie, Madam Pemefrey," the servant replies.`
			`	When she hears this, Pemefrey's expression changes from annoyance to elation. "Really? Oh, I can't thank enough for this, dearie. How was it rescuing her? Did you have to barter with smugglers to track her down? Chase down kidnappers to free her? Battle with warlords for her safety?"`

			`	Pemefrey snaps her head to look back at her servant. "Walters! I thought you were on my side!" She holds her hands on her chest. "It would be such a shame if you ruined our friendship like this. Why, I wouldn't be able to bear to keep you around if you betrayed me like that."`
			`	Walters shoots a desperate glance at you while stepping back, but otherwise says nothing.`
			`	"Now, where was I... oh, right. You. Out. Now." She claps twice, jumping Walters to attention, who beckons you and Puny back to the gate of the mansion.`
			`	You slam the door of the taxi shut as Walters locks the gate. The return journey is somewhat somber, with even Puny wearing a frown. When you look back up from Puny, you find yourself in a far more humble region of <origin>.

			`You wander into one of several dimly lit, smoke-filled bars near your docking bay. Soon after you sit down, a pair of hooded figures stand up and begin moving toward you.

You can't see their faces.`

				decline
			
			label meet
			`	The hooded figures turn out to be a boy and a girl, both perhaps thirteen or fourteen years old. The bundle in the girl's arms is a baby. "Are you a captain?" the boy asks.`
			`	"Yes," you say.`

We don't get paid anything unless they agree to let us go. But if you help us start a new life, we'll work hard and some day we'll pay you back."`

			`	As you are conversing a bearded man and a rough-looking teenage boy enter the bar and begin looking around the room. "That's our captain," she says. "Please, you have to help us. There's a service tunnel that connects to the back entrance of the bar. We can escape through there."`
			`	You've heard of these service passageways: the most dangerous part of this lawless station, dimly lit and seldom traveled, except by drug addicts and prostitutes. This whole thing might just be a ruse to lure you into one, where they can attack you without anyone interfering. "No," says the boy, "if we head for the service tunnel, they'll be sure to notice us. Let's just stay at the table until they go away."`
			`	The baby begins to cry, softly, and she bounces it gently, trying desperately to quiet it. "Shh. Shh." For the moment, it falls silent.`

			`	The boy stands up. "Wait ten seconds, then head to the tunnel," he says. He walks into the bathroom, which is right next to the back entrance that she pointed out. You wait for a few seconds, then stand up. "Don't run," says the girl. "Walk slowly. Pretend. You've had a bit too much to drink. We're headed out back to find some privacy." You don't dare look behind you to see if the men in the doorway are watching you.`
			`	Finally, you reach the back entrance, and she spins the wheel to unlock it. The hinges squeal, but it opens enough for you to squeeze through. You find yourselves in a narrow corridor lit only by flickering sodium lamps. In the yellow lamplight her face and hands look pale, jaundiced. The floor of the corridor is littered with beer bottles and discarded hypodermic needles. To one side of the door are several over-stuffed trash cans. As you step into the corridor, a rat scurries away into the darkness.`
			`	A few seconds later, watching through the open airlock, you see the boy walk out of the bathroom. He can't help stealing a quick glance towards the men in the doorway, after which he quickly ducks through the airlock and slams the door shut. "Run!" he whispers.`
			`	You begin running down the corridor, in the direction of your ship. You pass a man, slumped over in a corner; there is no time to see if he is dead, or just sleeping. In places the lights have gone out, and it is so dim that you can barely see the floor beneath you. Your footsteps pounding on the metal decking ring terribly loud up and down the empty hallway.`
			`	Eventually the passageway widens out into a maintenance room, full of humming equipment and large tanks. You duck behind one of them and listen for sounds of pursuit. "I think we're safe," says the boy. He walks over to another airlock door on the opposite wall and tugs it open. Light pours in, almost blinding at first. You are looking out into the rimway, the main passage in this ring of the station. Crowds of people are walking past, paying no attention to you. He glances quickly in both directions, then gestures for you to follow.`
				goto ship
			
			label outside
			`	You wait at the table, pretending that you are busy placing a drink order. The men at the door do not leave. Instead, they step into the room and begin circling around the edge of it. "What berth is your ship in?" asks the boy. You tell him. "Wait ten seconds, then follow," he says. He stands up and walks through the door. The searchers glance at him as he leaves, but they must be looking for two people together, because they ignore him.`
			`	The searchers approach the bar and begin talking to one of the bartenders. You and the girl stand up. "Walk slowly," she hisses under her breath. "Saunter. Don't run." You put an arm around her shoulders and do your best to act like an ordinary bar patron headed home with a new friend after having a bit too much to drink. You don't dare to glance at the bar to see if you are being watched.`
			`	Finally you reach the door. You are in the rimway, the main passage in this ring of the station. It is crowded and brightly lit. You quicken your pace slightly and begin walking toward your ship, still afraid that if you break into a run, you will attract attention. The girl keeps glancing at the shop windows that you pass by: checking the reflection to see if anyone is following you. "They're leaving the bar," she says. And then, "They're walking in the other direction. I think we're safe."`
			`	You pass a narrow doorway, probably an entrance to one of the service tunnels. The boy is standing there, holding a gun by his side. His grim expression softens somewhat when he sees you approaching.`
				goto ship

			`	You quickly make your way back to your ship. As soon as the door has closed behind you, all three of you breathe a sigh of relief. A second later, the baby begins to wail, loudly. As you show them to their bunks, they introduce themselves as Joe and Maria; the baby's name is Jesse. "I don't know how to thank you," says Maria.`
			`	"Please don't take too long leaving the station," adds Joe. "But, I think we'll be safe here until you're ready to leave. There's no way they can search all the ships at the dock."`

			`	Finally the band announces that their last song will be "Sad Archie." You've never heard of it, but the fans scream in approval. It's a slow, ballad-like song about a man named Archie who lives forever and is sad because the friends he makes all grow old and die. Archie has a pet dragon, and he builds a beautiful house for the dragon, but the dragon dies young. Archie is so sad seeing the dragon's house empty and gathering dust that he rents it out to some friends, but they fight with each other and trash the place. The story makes no sense, but some of the fans are wiping away tears as the song ends.`

The students have apparently just had some sort of science symposium, and poster boards are on display all along the walls. One of them catches your eye: the title is "Affordable Terraforming through Equilibrium Mapping."`
			`	The basic concept of the poster seems to be that instead of altering the climate of a planet through brute force, it ought to instead be feasible to use a properly timed nudge in the right direction to cause the climate to shift toward a new equilibrium point that supports greater biological complexity. This student seems to think that planets naturally "want" to grow more complex and support more life, but that they sometimes get "stuck" in less optimum states.`

			`	"Tundra's snow covered surface only exacerbates the problem, reflecting most of the star's light back into space," Nolan explains. "This means that we need to both alter the atmosphere in order for it to retain more heat and alter the surface in order for it to reflect less heat."`

			`	"Tundra has very low volcanic activity, but seismic mapping has led us to this area." Amy circles the red spot with her finger. "Magma from the planet's mantle is building up under this area of the crust, which, lucky for us, is unusually thin.

			`	Nolan answers, "The people who live near the volcano will need to evacuate the area with all their belongings. The Republic should provide any assistance needed for the evacuation. As for how we will cause the volcano to erupt, we need something energetic enough to crack the planet's crust in the location of the volcano, releasing the pressure that the magma is causing to spark an eruption. That's where we bring in another asteroi--"`
			`	"No, no, no!" the Republic representative exclaims, cutting Nolan off mid-sentence. "The Republic will not gain a reputation for crashing asteroids into its own planets. The consequences of such an action could be disastrous should it go wrong! And in what way will this warm the planet when the resulting volcanic winter could last decades and only result in an even colder climate? Are you not even old enough to remember how a supereruption on Hope caused the evacuation of the entire planet? If the people of Tundra are this desperate to terraform their planet then normal techniques should be employed, none of this 'equilibrium mapping' nonsense."`
			`	"Sir," Amy speaks up with a stern tone of voice, "we have already been authorized by the Republic to undergo this terraforming experiment, so unless you have half a teraton of cheap explosives, we're going to need to use an asteroid. The volcanic winter can be easily avoided by having a fleet of freighters sweep the volcanic ash out of the atmosphere, meaning we'll get the benefits of the greenhouse gases without the detriments of volcanic ash reflecting Cebalrai's heat back into space. No one knew the volcano on Hope was going to erupt, but we can prepare for this eruption and take steps to mitigate the problems." Amy looks the representative straight in the eyes and smirks. "We're scientists, we have this handled."`
			`	The representative falls silent. After a moment of thinking, he says "Captain, I need you to take me to Parliament.

He lets out wild screams of triumph as they soar through the sky and at last you can understand the appeal of this whole expedition. Your admiration is cut short by two catastrophic crashes on either side of the ship and accompanying sirens. The dragons are trying to get through.`

"Get on board!" shouts one of the men over the external speakers as you position the ship just below Karengo and lower the shields. Scales bounce off the roof like diamonds. Karengo releases his grip on the dragon and free falls toward you, slowing at the last possible moment before dropping through the top hatch. You flick on the shields and hit the engines, hard.

			`	"Remember me? Yer the best pilot I've had - that stunt to get us out of Skymoot, right out of the dragon's nest? Epic."`
			`	A crude sign behind him reads, "Dangerous Games - Karengo's Galactic Adventures."`
			`	"Like it?" Karengo follows your gaze. "Decided to make this an official thing. Well... an unofficial official thing. Feds wouldn't understand. Doesn't matter; I need a pilot again, and a good one. Your ship's waterproof, right?"`

			`As before on Skymoot, Karengo guides you down to a landing spot far away from the local government. "Don't want no interruptions," he says.`
			`	Despite days of pressuring, you've been unable to get Karengo to tell you exactly what a quoijuu is, other than a slightly ominous "the biggest fish." He sends a file to your ship computer and grins. "Since it's too late to back out now, it's time to fill you in. Quoijuu aren't the only thing down there; you've also got scyllae, taniwhales, morgawrii, plus some hydrothermal vents, none of which will benefit us if we run into them."`
			`	"The good news is that there's a path to follow. The bad news is the only person to traverse the path was a bit of a nut.

			`	The adventure seekers, who you've spent the trip getting to know, are getting ready. You watch a nearby pair, Daciana and Mussie, helping each other get their wetsuits on. Daciana catches your gaze and grins. "Bafta, mate. Safe sailing, see you on the other side." Karengo gives you a signal and you hurry back to the cockpit to fly out, away from safe shoals and over the watery abyss.`
			`	At your touch, the ship slowly sinks below the waves. As Karengo warned, most of your navigation systems quickly flash red warnings, then go offline; there is some unknown interference that overwhelms your ship's sensors, which were designed for space first and water second, or fifth, or not at all. Minutes tick by as the crew silently watches one of the few sensors still working.`
			`	EIGHT HUNDRED KILOPASCALS, the pressure gauge reads.`
			`	ONE THOUSAND KILOPASCALS.`
			`	ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED KILOPASCALS. A loud, metallic creak echoes through the ship and Mussie jumps, startled.`
			`	Karengo claps him on the back and gives him a signature grin. "Maybe <first> can keep you aboard after this in case they need anything from a high shelf!" Mussie smiles weakly, but his eyes don't leave the readout.`
			`	ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED KILOPASCALS. "This's it," Karengo announces, "Sub up! Let's see what there is to see. And <first>, keep it to passive sensors. Don't want to attract any undue attention." The ship smoothly descends into the mouth of a massive cave and your visibility, clouded by dark sulfide emissions from the hydrothermal vents at the floor, drops to less than eight meters. 6 personal subpods fan out behind you, their communication equipment syncing with yours to display them as blips on your screen.`

			`In the days since Riley came aboard, she has relaxed and cleaned up. She looks nearly unrecognizable from the tired, desperate woman you first saw.`
			`	On the way, she told you stories of her past, mostly of time shared with her father. As a young teen, they spent summers riding the latest horse mechs through the forest, looking for beehives to steal honey from. At age 19, she broke her ankle hoverboarding on a restricted mountain peak. Her father rescued her, avoiding the police to hike up with a medical kit. She talks about his wild birthday gifts to her each year, always a different piece of clothing with embedded AI that was just shy of what was allowed by law. As you watch, she shows how her shirt warms and constricts if it detects stress, mimicking a hug.`
			`	As you neared <system>, Riley told you about the last time she saw her father. He had become focused on his work - research into safe AI - and they hadn't seen each other for years. She had become a well-known DJ back on <origin> and had a break in her touring schedule, so she spent a good chunk of her savings meeting up with him on Memory. They spent most of a week together, reliving old times.`
			`	He'd cried when it was time to leave, and she had, too, but life went on, and it was years before she heard from him again. His message nearly broke her. "Ri, please come as soon as you can. I may not have long, and wish to hold your hand one more time. All love, Dad."`
			`	She doesn't mention it, but it's clear that she's concerned she'll arrive too late to say goodbye.`

			`	Her father is in a comfortable-looking medical cradle. Wires flow from it to the holoscreens around the room, showing vitals and other indecipherable information. Despite his wan, strained face and atrophied body, he raises his head to look at his daughter.`

			`	Riley, in turn, had always surrounded herself with music, and moved to <origin> to share her passion with other like-minded people. You talk about what it's like to call a ship your home, leaving behind everything you grew up knowing and embracing life as a starship captain.`
			`	Finally, her father lies back. "Well, thank you for making the trip out to see your old man. I... have to go now, I think. Don't forget about me, hear? And..." Church hesitates for a moment. "Whatever happens, please don't think ill of me. I will always love you."`

			label voice
			`	Without warning, you hear Church's voice from a corner of the room. It's coming from some sort of computer system, held aloft by hundreds of cables dangling from the ceiling.`
			`	"It... worked." His voice fizzles, and his tone is not the one you recognize from before. Riley's head whips around, and you reflexively move your hand toward your holstered gun. "Do not be alarmed. I have been working on a personal project for over a decade now. My mind was uploaded to the modified Core you are looking at. I had to say goodbye in case the procedure failed - I did not know if it would work. You cannot upload a mind while it's still alive. I tried that many times."

			`	"Riley, what do you think?" Church asks.`
			`	"Dad, is that really you? How do you feel?"`
			`	She steps closer to the Core. Church pauses. "Riley, what do you think?" it repeats. The voice coming from the machine is oddly flat in affect. "I feel fine. Do you feel fine?" They talk for a few tentative minutes, at first about how he's feeling, before moving onto the memories that Church retained during the transfer. You begin to relax as the two interact when you realize that Church is retelling the story of how he evaded the police to fix Riley's ankle for the third time in a row.`
			`	Finally, she turns to you. "I'll admit that he doesn't sound as lively as he used to, but... how many people get a second chance to spend time with their father before he's gone? Thank you for bringing me out here, and for coming. I'll never forget your part in this. For now, I'd like to stay here. You go - I'll find my own way back." She seems genuinely happy.`

			`	Bunker locates a sheltered outcrop near the <ship> and releases the drones from a briefcase he took with him; the drones are so small you can't make them out.

"Okay, they're on autopilot to the rendezvous site."`

			`	"Pigs," blurts out Bunker. He zooms in on two men talking a few meters away from everyone else. One is in a suit, the other a black hooded robe. "Must be the leaders," he whispers as if they can hear him. Just then, the hooded man looks up to the sky as if he sees something. He motions, and the Quicksilvers fire up their engines.`
