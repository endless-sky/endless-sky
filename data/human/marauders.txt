	description "This Arrow has had numerous modifications to its hull and internal systems to make more room for outfits - mostly with combat in mind. More shields, weapons, engines, outfit space, and a turret mount nearly push this ship into classification as a light warship, and definitely make it one of the heaviest interceptors you're likely to find."

	description `This Manta has undergone extensive modification, featuring extra hull plating, shield emitters, weapon space, and even a turret mount. Whoever modified it seems to have forgotten to include dedicated space for the power systems, as they're crammed in and around everything else like an afterthought. If its dry tonnage were any higher, it would be classified as a heavy warship.`

This aftermarket model also features a turret mount, perhaps in an answer to Lionheart's Headhunter. The shop that built this ship is sure to see more customers."

If it weren't for the wings, the central hull would barely be recognizable as Lionheart's original under the patchwork that you expect has made an already deadly warship even more so."

This one appears to have been modified for even more of the latter at the expense of the former, and the central hull can only be recognized as a Raven because of the wings. Two more engine bays, more outfit space, additional shield emitters, and a turret make this already deadly warship appear even more frightening."

Besides adding a turret, this ship has enormous gun ports, making you wonder how much more deadly you could possibly make a warship this small."
