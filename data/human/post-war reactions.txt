			`As you leave your ship, you see a crowd watching a video screen not far from your landing spot. The video jumps between a panel discussion and footage of Admiral Danforth being quizzed by Parliament. It has finished by the time you arrive, and many of the onlookers have already left for their business. Two captains remain, however, and, by the sounds of it, they're having a passionate discussion about the video.`

Was it the spaceport landing area this time? I can see scratches and bruises all over you." Gus replies, "I'm sorry, Calvin! I was curious."`
			`	Calvin lets him out of the hold and says to you, "Thank you for saving my brother. He's the only family I have left, and I hope," he pinches him, "he'll stop risking his life out of curiosity." He looks at Gus kindly. "Come on, let's get you to the medic."`
