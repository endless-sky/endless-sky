			`	When you join them at the restaurant, Katya says, "It's really great to see you again, <first>."`

				goto end

			`	"Whoops," says Ijs, "now you've done it, there goes the fourth wall."`
			`	Katya laughs. "If you're so eager to explore the rest of the galaxy, <first>, maybe you should volunteer to help out with creating the stories to populate it. This is an open source game after all, and it would be a sad thing for it to remain the product of only one person's imagination."`
				goto end

			`	Your dinner arrives, and you spend a pleasant evening eating together and reminiscing about old times. Back in the days of the civil war, neither Katya and Ijs were people who smiled or laughed easily, but now they have an entirely different air about them, peaceful and contented. It's heartening to see that they, at least, have found a happy ending together after all the chaos you lived through.`
			`	Suddenly you realize that around you, the restaurant workers are sweeping the floors and putting chairs up on tables: it's closing time, and you are the last ones there. "Well <first>," says Ijs, "it was good of you to stop by, and I wish you the best in your journeys among the stars. Give our regards to the others if you see them." You wish them well, and return to your ship.`

He tells you that his life has continued to be quite full since the war ended and the Council was dissolved: he's been placed in charge of the Free Worlds diplomatic corps, whose main job appears to be to make sure all the individual worlds within the coalition feel like their concerns are being listened to. "It means lots of travel," he says, "and lots of fine meals with important people. And they're always interested to hear my stories from the war times."`
			`	You tell Alondo a bit about what you've been doing since the war ended. "Of course," he says, "you're traveling the galaxy. I knew from the start you weren't the kind who would quickly put down roots on a single planet."`
			`	Alondo goes on to describe some of the inner workings of the Free Worlds Senate, and the mutual defense arrangement that forms the backbone of the coalition. "For a while there," he says, "it felt like there was so much bureaucracy that we couldn't get anything done, but now it's finally starting to function in the way all of us imagined. Quite an honor to have had a hand in the birth of a new government."`

I don't believe society or government just naturally becomes good or stays good without effort. So I'm here to speak up when we start to stray from our original vision."`
			`	You sit and talk with each other for quite a while longer, reminiscing about old times. Then, you wish him well in his work, and he tells you to stop by and say hello any time you're in the area. You head back to your ship.`

Already, it appears that some of the empty apartments have become actual living quarters for people, and there are even a handful of shops opening up on the main street.`

The real breakthrough, of course, would be if we could find some hints in the stuff they left behind about how to build more jump drives of our own. But so far, we can't even figure out how to create new hyperspace links where there wasn't one originally. I'm starting to think that those graviton transmitters we used were just one more game - a toy, not the real thing. Not what created the links in the first place, I mean, unless they were created by someone with the patience to wait a million years for them to work."`

That's how all the artifacts we find here feel - not like the real thing that the Pug would have used, but like a simplified model that they gave us to help us figure it out. Everything they left behind, I'm convinced they left intentionally, because it could teach us something they wanted us to know, while keeping all their true secrets secret. The rest of you moved on, and I'm still here playing their game."`
				goto end
			
			label pug
			`	"Not much," she says. "This world - it feels like when you're visiting a friend's house, and they spent the whole day cleaning up for you. It's not like a person's home is when you drop by unannounced. Nothing's out of place. Everything that's lying out somewhere, is something they wanted you to see. There's some weird technology they left behind, but all of it is like toys, puzzles... I don't know, like an educational game they designed for us to play. The rest of you moved on, and I'm still here playing their game."`

Even if everything we're discovering here is nothing more than what they intended for us to discover, it's still the most interesting work I could possibly be doing right now. So, don't feel sorry for me. Really."`
			`	You talk for a while longer, and she tells you she'll be sure to be in touch if they ever get to the root of the Pug's motivation. "Until then," she says, "good luck in your travels. I hope the galaxy never runs out of ways to surprise you."`

Big ships will usually ward off these effects much longer than a smaller ship would, but that's always been a notable issue with the original design.
