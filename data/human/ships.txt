	description "The Argosy from Southbound Shipyards is very popular with merchants not because of its capacity, which is actually slightly smaller than the Syndicate Freighter, but because it can hold its own in combat even against a small pirate fleet."
	description "	The Argosy is also a very easy ship to upgrade with faster engines or more powerful weapons as needed, so many privately owned Argosies have very different capabilities than the stock model."

	description "The Auxiliary was built with modularity in mind, allowing the ship to be fitted for more cargo or bunk space depending on the mission. This modularity makes the ship rather expensive to build, however, and therefore a rare sight to see."

	description "The Lionheart Bactrian is the last of the great city-ships, a design hearkening back to the early days of space colonization when a long-distance vessel needed to be a self-contained world, able to survive for weeks at a time without encountering an inhabited planet. It is not only a freighter, but a carrier, and a capable warship either at short range or at a distance."

	description `Though the Syndicate doesn't build fighter carriers, it is testing the waters with the Barb, a cheap and flexible carrier-launched craft featuring newly-developed miniaturized ion engines. The design philosophy of the Barb seems to have been "uglier than the Protector," and as you look at the cockpit nestled between the massive gun port and turret mount, you wonder where the power systems are supposed to go. Though an awkward-looking ship, it seems flexible enough to become a dangerous addition to any fleet with carriers.`

	description `After introducing the "Type F" cargo pod for the Hauler, it became apparent to merchant captains that the new carriers could offer more flexibility within their fleet, if there were a cargo box they could attach to the fighter arms. Enter the "F6-C: Boxwing," the Fighter that doesn't fight, but carries cargo instead. Cargo preservation equipment gives the Boxwing much more mass and very poor heat dissipation characteristics compared to other fighters. That it cannot carry any weapons is only part of the reason jocks call it "Flying Coffin" amongst themselves; besides the ship resembling one and being very sluggish, the pilot "seat" doubles as a bunk, and is cramped beyond the comfort level of most. The interactive panoramic window H.U.D. is the only thing that keeps claustrophobic episodes from becoming a major problem.`
	description "	Fighters do not come equipped with a hyperdrive. You cannot carry a fighter unless you have a ship in your fleet with a fighter bay."

	description "The Bulk Freighter is the ultimate cargo ship, able to carry as much cargo as four ordinary Syndicate Freighters. Its on-board gearing allows it to service even the most primitive colonies, though dock workers in busier spaceports often joke that it would be simpler to carry smaller freighters within its gigantic holds."
	description "	It is also an incredibly slow and difficult to maneuver ship, especially when loaded down with cargo. Some freight caravans use ordinary freighters instead of Bulk Freighters just to avoid the hassle of constantly having to wait for the Bulk Freighter to properly align itself for hyperspace travel."

	description `The Bulwark is basically what you get by welding a bunch of scrap metal on to a Bastion. It is a tough, slow brawler that is most often used by warlords to protect their properties, whether it'd be their ships or hideouts from raids by either the authorities or their rivals. Due to their lack of speed and cargo space these ships rarely participate in raiding merchant convoys outside their home system.`

As a result, the latest model of freighter is equipped only with turrets, including an anti-missile turret to prevent attackers from simply bombarding them into submission from a safe distance."

Armed with a variety of weapons, the Frigate is equally capable at fending off small fighters or bombarding larger ships. In its time it possessed relatively good maneuverability for a ship of its size, but now it sees continued use mostly due to the sheer number of them already built for service."

	description "The Mule is as much of a hodgepodge as its looks suggest. The Lionheart ship designers combined a good deal of cargo space with a decent amount of weaponry and even a fighter bay, and ended up with a ship that is mostly used as a freighter but can also be used as a warship because of its heavy armament and shields. This hodgepodge nature has its downside, though, namely its high crew requirement and the fact that any dedicated ship of the same cost will do better in a specialized role than the Mule will."

	description `Southbound Shipyards quickly answered the Free Worlds' call for a carrier by building modified cargo containers for Haulers - adding a pair of Fighter docking arms, some additional outfit space, and even a couple of bunks. Access to the fighters from within the ship is so inconvenient that most pilots opt to just stay aboard their fighters when in flight. While the technical name for this ship is "Hauler I: Type F," Southbound assembly workers started calling the single container variant the "Nest" due to its complement of Finch Fighters, and the name stuck.`

	description "After the Blackbird gained surprising popularity as an agile light warship despite its original design as a transport, Tarazed decided to produce a new design specifically intended as a warship. The Osprey was the result. Although it is considered overpriced by most savvy pilots, it is nevertheless a perennial favorite among those who have the extra cash to spend on it."

	description "The Megaparsec Quicksilver is a warship built around a single concept: to design the smallest and fastest ship capable of carrying two Particle Cannons. Because of its speed and long weapons range, the Quicksilver can keep a safe distance from most targets and bombard them with particle bursts until they are destroyed. Unfortunately the Headhunter eventually surpassed the original design intent, but the Quicksilver's better durability to cost ratio, and the existence of long-term contracts, has kept it in use with Syndicate security forces."

	description "The Rainmaker is a missile boat built in the Republic Navy Yard. It comes equipped with four missile launchers and enough ammunition to destroy even ships many times its size. Because of their lack of maneuverability and relatively light shielding, Rainmakers serve best as long-range attack ships, and once their missile supply is spent, they are relatively useless in combat."

	description `Southbound Shipyards' new fighter-carrying containers have created a new use for what many considered an outdated design. Four external fighter bays make this the biggest civilian carrier on the market, if a little awkward as a warship. After Southbound assembly workers successfully named the "Nest," "Hauler II: Type F" was quickly dubbed the "Roost" to continue the theme.`

	description "The Lionheart Scoutship was designed back in the days when the galaxy was more sparsely populated, and ships prospecting for habitable worlds or worlds rich in resources would often travel far away from any habitable ports where they would be able to refuel. Although the galaxy has now been much more thoroughly explored, the Scout remains a popular ship for long-distance travel."

This versatile ship serves equally well as a passenger transport or a cargo courier. It also happens to be the cheapest ship you can buy which is capable of hyperspace travel."
	description `	Shuttles are not designed to withstand combat of any sort, but they are fast and maneuverable enough to get out of harm's way if attacked by a larger, slower ship. Although they are typically unarmed, they have enough space for one weapon, which is the origin of the popular phrase, "as useless as a blaster cannon on a shuttlecraft."`

When the Free Worlds asked for a carrier, they did not expect one that would be able to carry more fighters than even the heaviest Navy warships. Given this fact, the Free Worlds have asked Southbound and Tarazed to restrict sale of the "Hauler III: Type F," "Skein" to its Militia only.`

	description "Classified as an interceptor rather than a fighter because it has its own hyperdrive instead of needing to be carried inside a larger ship, the Tarazed Sparrow is the smallest and cheapest combat ship available. Because of its limited cargo and passenger space, the primary way for a Sparrow pilot to pay the bills is to upgrade the weapons and hunt pirates... or become one. In either case, it is a perilous way to earn a living."
	description "	Government reports indicate that as many as two out of every three first-time ship buyers who choose to pilot a Sparrow lose their ship (and often, their life as well) within the first month of owning it. Pilots who have survived longer than that tend to swear by replacing the stock weapons with missile launchers."

	description "	Because they often carry valuable cargo, and because they are too slow to evade any attackers, Star Barges are a common target of pirates."

	description "The Star Queen is a relic of a more peaceful period of galactic history: a luxury liner for high-end tourists. Every cabin has its own mini-bar, and the bathrooms have marble tile and showers that use actual hot water instead of chemicals or sonic vibrations."
	description "	In support of environmental movements across the galaxy, all Star Queens come standard with an array of solar panels as their only source of energy as opposed to more popular power generators such as fuel cells or nuclear reactors that produce some amount of waste. Although some argue that this is a pointless move given the prevalence of clean fusion reactors, others have applauded it and cited the prohibitive costs of fusion reactors as a reason for using solar panels."

	description "Valkyries are pirate Aeries converted into more of a standalone warship than a support carrier. Losing a turret and a few bunks in place of increased armor protection, as well as boasting two more gun mounts, allows Valkyries to both take and put out noticeable amounts of damage. However, due to the extra weight, they are somewhat slower and lose a bit of shield efficiency."

	description `The Vanguard is Syndicated Systems' newest warship intended for the heavy anti-pirate defense market. Vanguards offer an unusual feature set, focusing on powerful fixed guns and featuring Syndicated Systems' latest automation technologies, resulting in an atypically low crew complement for a ship its size. Few capital ships will endure for long under the withering fusillade of gunfire that it can unleash against those in front of it.`
