	description "The Argosy from Southbound Shipyards is very popular with merchants not because of its capacity, which is actually slightly smaller than the Syndicate Freighter, but because it can hold its own in combat even against a small pirate fleet."
	description "	The Argosy is also a very easy ship to upgrade with faster engines or more powerful weapons as needed, so many privately owned Argosies have very different capabilities than the stock model."

	description "The Auxiliary was built with modularity in mind, allowing the ship to be fitted for more cargo or bunk space depending on the mission. This modularity makes the ship rather expensive to build, however, and therefore a rare sight to see."

	description "The Lionheart Bactrian is the last of the great city-ships, a design hearkening back to the early days of space colonization when a long-distance vessel needed to be a self-contained world, able to survive for weeks at a time without encountering an inhabited planet. It is not only a freighter, but a carrier, and a capable warship either at short range or at a distance."

	description `Though the Syndicate doesn't build fighter carriers, it is testing the waters with the Barb, a cheap and flexible carrier-launched craft featuring newly-developed miniaturized ion engines. The design philosophy of the Barb seems to have been "uglier than the Protector," and as you look at the cockpit nestled between the massive gun port and turret mount, you wonder where the power systems are supposed to go. Though an awkward-looking ship, it seems flexible enough to become a dangerous addition to any fleet with carriers.`
	description "	In order to be capable of fitting a Proton Gun while still maintaining a turret mount, Syndicated Systems had to remove various life support systems, requiring that the pilot wear a pressurized suit rather than having the cabin be fully pressurized. Although it makes piloting a Barb an uncomfortable experience, the result is a level of short-range firepower that is unheard of for a craft its size."
	description "	Fighters do not come equipped with a hyperdrive. You cannot carry a fighter unless you have a ship in your fleet with a fighter bay."

	description `After introducing the "Type F" cargo pod for the Hauler, it became apparent to merchant captains that the new carriers could offer more flexibility within their fleet, if there were a cargo box they could attach to the fighter arms. Enter the "F6-C: Boxwing," the Fighter that doesn't fight, but carries cargo instead. Cargo preservation equipment gives the Boxwing much more mass and very poor heat dissipation characteristics compared to other fighters. That it cannot carry any weapons is only part of the reason jocks call it "Flying Coffin" amongst themselves; besides the ship resembling one and being very sluggish, the pilot "seat" doubles as a bunk, and is cramped beyond the comfort level of most. The interactive panoramic window H.U.D. is the only thing that keeps claustrophobic episodes from becoming a major problem.`
	description "	Fighters do not come equipped with a hyperdrive. You cannot carry a fighter unless you have a ship in your fleet with a fighter bay."

	description "The Bulk Freighter is the ultimate cargo ship, able to carry as much cargo as four ordinary Syndicate Freighters. Its on-board gearing allows it to service even the most primitive colonies, though dock workers in busier spaceports often joke that it would be simpler to carry smaller freighters within its gigantic holds."
	description "	It is also an incredibly slow and difficult to maneuver ship, especially when loaded down with cargo. Some freight caravans use ordinary freighters instead of Bulk Freighters just to avoid the hassle of constantly having to wait for the Bulk Freighter to properly align itself for hyperspace travel."

	description `The Bulwark is basically what you get by welding a bunch of scrap metal on to a Bastion. It is a tough, slow brawler that is most often used by warlords to protect their properties, whether it'd be their ships or hideouts from raids by either the authorities or their rivals. Due to their lack of speed and cargo space these ships rarely participate in raiding merchant convoys outside their home system.`

	description "The Dagger is a fighter designed by Lionheart Industries, intended to be carried by their Aerie warship, although other ships have been known to carry them, as well.

	description `Prior to the formation of the galactic Republic, many star systems were owned by "governing corporate entities," with the vast majority of space being inaccessible to private citizens. The only exception to this rule were the pirate bands, whose few ships were often stolen or rebellious corporate fleets of their own, yet who had an outsized impact on interstellar trade. The necessity for corporations to protect their operations meant that Enforcer was one of the most common vessels used for security and defense. The ship boasts an armament of four gun ports and a turreted mount, all packed on a small but defensible frame that was powerful for its time.`
	description `	Although no longer on the market, the Enforcer finds itself in the possession of a small number of merchants and, ironically, various groups of pirates, as an aging combat ship easily outperformed by other light warships or even interceptors of a similar size.`

Armed with a variety of weapons, the Frigate is equally capable at fending off small fighters or bombarding larger ships. In its time it possessed relatively good maneuverability for a ship of its size, but now it sees continued use mostly due to the sheer number of them already built for service."

	description "Several centuries ago, in the early days of the Republic, the sudden increase in commerce and space travel led to high demand for cargo ships. Haulers were first created simply by bolting a cockpit and engine block onto a cargo container, and the basic design has not changed much since then."

	description `First manufactured by a forgotten shipyard many centuries ago, the Hogshead got its iconic name from the keg-like shape of its engine pods; its design was a hot topic of discussion for captains everywhere. The ship quickly became popular after first being released for consumer purchase and was commonly seen around various systems as the go-to "space bus" in human space.`
	description `	Unfortunately, only a few decades after introducing the ship, the shipyard went bankrupt and was never heard from again, leaving the Hogshead to history as their one-hit-wonder. In the current era, Hogsheads are much less common; they are considered "unsightly" compared to modern vessels such as the Star Queen, though a few places in human space still sell them.`

	description "The Mule is as much of a hodgepodge as its looks suggest. The Lionheart ship designers combined a good deal of cargo space with a decent amount of weaponry and even a fighter bay, and ended up with a ship that is mostly used as a freighter but can also be used as a warship because of its heavy armament and shields. This hodgepodge nature has its downside, though, namely its high crew requirement and the fact that any dedicated ship of the same cost will do better in a specialized role than the Mule will."

	description `Southbound Shipyards quickly answered the Free Worlds' call for a carrier by building modified cargo containers for Haulers - adding a pair of Fighter docking arms, some additional outfit space, and even a couple of bunks. Access to the fighters from within the ship is so inconvenient that most pilots opt to just stay aboard their fighters when in flight. While the technical name for this ship is "Hauler I: Type F," Southbound assembly workers started calling the single container variant the "Nest" due to its complement of Finch Fighters, and the name stuck.`

	description "The Megaparsec Quicksilver is a warship built around a single concept: to design the smallest and fastest ship capable of carrying two Particle Cannons. Because of its speed, reverse thrusters, and long weapons range, the Quicksilver can keep a safe distance from most targets and bombard them with particle bursts until they are destroyed. The focus on its weaponry left the Quicksilver with no room for even the most basic shield generator. Unfortunately the Headhunter eventually surpassed the original design intent, but the Quicksilver's better durability to cost ratio, and the existence of long-term contracts, has kept it in use with Syndicate security forces."

	description "During the caravan era, a boom of economic development spread along the paths of more heavily armed and technologically advanced merchant fleets originating from the Deep, which resulted in ships such as the Saber being developed. This medium warship was one of the powerhouses of military might in its time, armed to the teeth with five gun ports in the nose and a dorsal turret mount to fire at anything not in front of it. As pirates began to join together in larger war bands in response to the more heavily defended merchants, the Saber became popular amongst them as well. Unlike other ships such as the Firebird, it slowly faded out as competition rose, but it is nevertheless cherished by those who still own one."

	description `	Shuttles are not designed to withstand combat of any sort, but they are fast and maneuverable enough to get out of harm's way if attacked by a larger, slower ship. Although they are typically unarmed, they have enough space for one weapon, which is the origin of the popular phrase, "as useless as a blaster cannon on a shuttlecraft."`

	description `This particular cockpit and engine set has found itself attached to three of Southbound Shipyards' new "Type F" Fighter-carrier pods. When the Free Worlds asked for a carrier, they did not expect one that would be able to carry more fighters than even the heaviest Navy warships. Given this fact, the Free Worlds have asked Southbound and Tarazed to restrict sale of the "Hauler III: Type F," "Skein" to its Militia only.`

	description "Classified as an interceptor rather than a fighter because it has its own hyperdrive instead of needing to be carried inside a larger ship, the Tarazed Sparrow is the smallest and cheapest combat ship available. Because of its limited cargo and passenger space, the primary way for a Sparrow pilot to pay the bills is to upgrade the weapons and hunt pirates... or become one. In either case, it is a perilous way to earn a living."
	description "	Government reports indicate that as many as two out of every three first-time ship buyers who choose to pilot a Sparrow lose their ship (and often, their life as well) within the first month of owning it. Pilots who have survived longer than that tend to swear by replacing the stock weapons with missile launchers."

	description "The Splinter is the largest warship produced by the Megaparsec shipyard.

	description "The Syndicate CT-50 Star Barge is little more than a cluster of cargo containers with an engine at one end and a cockpit on the other. It is a slow and ugly ship, but it can carry enough cargo to earn its captain a steady income even in parts of the galaxy where it is hard to find passengers to carry or courier missions."

	description "The Star Queen is a relic of a more peaceful period of galactic history: a luxury liner for high-end tourists. Every cabin has its own mini-bar, and the bathrooms have marble tile and showers that use actual hot water instead of chemicals or sonic vibrations."
	description "	In support of environmental movements across the galaxy, all Star Queens come standard with an array of solar panels as their only source of energy as opposed to more popular power generators such as fuel cells or nuclear reactors that produce some amount of waste. Although some argue that this is a pointless move given the prevalence of clean fusion reactors, others have applauded it and cited the prohibitive costs of fusion reactors as a reason for using solar panels."

	description "Valkyries are pirate Aeries converted into more of a standalone warship than a support carrier. Losing a turret and a few bunks in place of increased armor protection, as well as boasting two more gun mounts, allows Valkyries to both take and put out noticeable amounts of damage. However, due to the extra weight, they are somewhat slower and lose a bit of shield efficiency."
