			`	"Like a new engine," says Franz.`
			`	"But not just a new engine. No one can rival the Deep's atomic engines for tightly-packed power. But what if you need more? You need an afterburner."`
			`	"But an afterburner burns up so much fuel," you say. "You can run out before you can escape!"`
			`	"And that," Franz beams, "is why we have created the Ionic Afterburner. It uses just a little fuel, with a large amount of ordinary power, to give you that boost of speed more safely."`
			`	"And cooler," says another. You're not sure if he's too 'hip' for the group, or just meaning it's less likely to overheat your ship.`
			`	"...And it's cooler," agrees Franz. "But untested, save for a few prototypes that went 'missing'. Which yours mustn't."`
			`	"We know who you are..." whispers a voice, but you can see quite clearly who it was.`
			`	"We do indeed, but Captain <last> won't let us down." Franz' trust in you is reassuring. "Captain, while we speak one of these new ionic afterburners is being installed into your ship. Fly to <waypoints>, confound the pirates with your new abilities, and return here to report on how well the afterburner worked."`
			`	And with that he dismisses you with a gesture, and you leave the men to their meeting, and to the shelf of rare bottles of vintage wine you saw a maid bring as you leave.`

			`	"They cannot reproduce the normal way, like the human cattle working beneath our feet. They had to round up large groups of women and artificially impregnate them, using special genetic manipulation technology, like which created them in the first place."`
