			`As you wander the spaceport with a snack, waiting for your ship to be refueled, you pass a local souvenir shop and poke your head in to kill a little time. You see a decent looking mug with the text "<origin>" printed underneath an attractive, stylized representation of the spaceport you are presently standing in and pick it up to see how it feels. The handle is solid, not too small for your fingers, and the lip of it looks like it would be comfortable to drink out of.`
			`	Two young adults wander into the aisle just a couple of meters away, conversing in a language that you don't understand, one that is perhaps local to the Deep. They're cooing over an item they've found, but when one flips it over to look at the price tag, there is an immediate exchange of looks and expressions that does not require translation. The item ends up back on the shelf with a giggle and a head-shake.`

You find yourself noticing people who seem to be invisible to most of those going about their business, but they never catch your eye. They always appear to be doing their utmost to avoid notice.`
			`	You haven't noticed children that look poor here in the past, but on this occasion you spot one as he knocks over a mop and bucket... right in front of a businessman and his family rolling their bags through the spaceport. You've never seen someone go so deathly pale as the cleaner, the boy's mother, who scurries to fix things before the man even draws a breath.`
			`	A pair of security officers appear almost immediately, before you could intercede one way or the other, as the man and his family begin to complain. One officer provides assurances as the other supervises the cleaner, who quickly hurries her child out of harms way.`

			`As you walk past a number of ships and crew going about their work in the spaceport, a small gathering in front of a Shuttle catches your attention. A young woman wearing a rather cheesy pilot uniform is in the midst of a little group of people all celebrating together. As you pass by them, a man standing on the top of a ladder breaks a bottle of Champagne on the (clearly not new) ship's hull. A loud cheer erupts from the group, earning an embarrassed blush from the young woman.`

			`	"The work isn't easy, but finding a job is the least of your worries. I'm sure that you'll have this ship paid off in no time."`
			`	You stay around and talk with the aspiring pilot for a few minutes, giving her tips and advice before stating that you have work to do. As you turn to leave, an older man places his hand on your arm, stopping you.`
