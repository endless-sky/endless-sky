# Note about Earth Day and Earth Hour:
# Earth Day (in 2023) is a day of awareness about climate change and occurs every 22nd of April. Earth Hour is an hour
# of blackout around cities worldwide, also to bring awareness to climate change, and it's observed on the last Saturday
# of March.

# Since Earth Day has become a quasi-'national day' for Earthlings in Endless Sky, it would be interesting to have Earth
# Hour be conflated with Earth Day as well, to demonstrate how people in a thousand years' time observe what we observe
# today and how its meaning has changed.

So as a show of unity against that people started celebrating Earth's natural beauty by bringing us back to our past."`

Many of the usually empty landing pads are occupied, and you notice a sizable crowd at the edge of the spaceport as you step out onto its rather untarnished apron. Some members of the crowd are obviously from offworld judging by their height, and there's even a few media crews standing by, although it looks like their camera drones are struggling with Burthen's gravity.`

			`	Each step takes significantly more effort than you're used to, but you eventually reach the crowd. From the signs that have been put up on the way, it looks like the "Burthen Triathlon" is taking place today, and the spaceport has been designated the finishing point. A couple of especially sturdy-looking marquees have been set up; the smaller one appears to be the administration tent, currently only accessible to event staff, while the other one is far larger and is catering food and drinks for the crowd nearby.`

			`	Thankfully, the walk to the catering tent is far shorter than the walk from your ship, but nevertheless you're exhausted by the time you drag your feet inside. A lot of effort has been put into this tent: the metal chairs are all sturdily-built to allow offworlders to pull themselves up, but cushioned as to not make it uncomfortable to sit in. A small firepit has been built in the middle of the tent, along with a couple fire extinguishers placed nearby, and the whole place is brightly lit in contrast to Burthen's typically chilly weather. Quite a few people, both Burthenians and offworlders, are mingling about here.`
			`	There's a counter in the corner with two levels, apparently so that the Burthenian attending it can serve both offwolders and locals. Alongside the typical drinks you've seen in spaceport bars and some local to the southern Core, the counter also offers a local drink called the "Antigrav" that claims to "ease visitors from Burthen's natural pull," and comes in a specially made glass, all for 30 credits.`

			`	Staying outside in the oppressive gravity and the chilly temperature, you move over to the sidelines and watch the large, portable screen that is broadcasting the leading competitors from above. It appears that competitors are divided into Burthenians and offworlders, with Burthenians wearing white helmets and offworlders wearing red helmets. It's nearing the end of the whole event; the competitor in front is named Abernathy, a stocky Burthenian apparently doing his eleventh Burthen Triathlon. Meanwhile, the leading offworlder is five hundred meters behind him, a competitor from Martini named Caldarone. Apparently, they've been at it for over 11 hours, beginning with a 1.5 kilometer swim, then a 40 kilometer bicycle ride, and finally a 10 kilometer run.`
			`	After a couple minutes, Abernathy emerges from behind a bend, camera drones chasing him. Cheers, whoops, and rather overly enthusiastic hollers erupt from the crowd, raising enormously as he dashes through the finishing straight, the drones now circling around him. Just over the crowd a loudspeaker announces, "And here comes the winner of the Syndicate Athletics Burthen Triathlon, the world triathlete champion, competitor number fifty-eight: Samuel Abernathy!"`

Being the center of the planet's extensive transportation system, it seems as if you are wading through thousands of Gagarians and offworlders in every atrium and hallway of this spaceport, as they do the same to make their connections on- and off-world.`
			`	But as you make your way into the central hall, you notice that, where you'd expect the greatest activity, everything has stopped.

Surrounding them is a cordon of guerrillas in their rosy CCOR uniforms, sizing up the public and the spaceport security around them with their rifles and pistols.`
			`	The painting guerrillas are busily finishing off the touches of what appears to be a statue of the burgundy and white emblem of the Confederated Councils, while a pile of rubble beside it suggests that a symbol of the local government once stood in its place.

And for near a century they have colluded to impose their designs on our worlds! The corporate insurrection in Novo Minho and the gang wars in the northern Outer Rim are an obvious extension of the arm of people like Alastair Korban, only leading to further suffering and bitter destruction in our region!`
			`	"But there is still hope. We can bring about the independence of Gagarin and unify this world that has been lost to the Syndicate-sponsored oligarchs and their cronies and puppet officials. We can reunite the Outer Rim and restore the prosperity stolen from us. We can form a new Confederated Councils and once again shine the light of Belenos across the entire galaxy!"`
			`	The gendarmes look around and consider the response of the crowd around them as the man finishes his speech to scattered applause. The speaker steps down and orders his guerrillas into formation before marching them out of the still crowd and into the back of a dusty, burgundy army van you hadn't noticed before, leaving the remains of the old statue scattered around the empty space.`
			`	You turn around and see the gendarme you ended up next to. He meets your eyes and recognizes your off-world air.`
			`	"Just an everyday interruption, Captain," he says. "Only nostalgists for the old cause. We get a dozen of these incidents a month." He seems to be interrupted by a buzz from the radio receiver at his hip and strides off into the crowd, leaving you on the ledge.`
			`	Slowly but surely, the spaceport snaps out of its shock and picks up its previous momentum, although as you turn around you pass two government-branded trucks mounted with cranes, almost certainly there to carry off the newly installed statue and to clean up the mess left behind by the guerrillas.`

			`	Crossroads refueling station investments continue to meet projections, with healthy margins and steady returns. Following several modest investments in operational efficiency, returns are tracking slightly above baseline forecasts, ensuring a consistent annualized return to investors. The station's strategic position on the centrally located planet continues to generate strong traffic, further solidifying its long-term profitability.`

			`	Investment returns from the Crossroads refueling station are currently below comparable benchmarks. However, environmental-related legal actions have been significantly lower than anticipated, resulting in reduced provisions for legal fees. Additionally, localized employee turnover has halved during this period, contributing to enhanced operational stability and providing a favorable outlook for the coming quarters.`

			`	A serious accident at the Crossroads refueling station resulted in injuries to two dozen employees and one fatality. While the legal ramifications are being addressed, the station's outsized returns have more than compensated for the legal fees incurred due to this unfortunate and unpredictable occurrence. Financial projections remain strong, with returns far exceeding expectations.`

			`	You make your way towards the refueling station on a bulky vehicle closed off from the radioactive air. Nevertheless, you still feel a faint metallic taste in the back of your throat as you see blue and purple tumbleweeds drift with the sand out the window. Eventually you pull up to the depot and refueling station.`
			`	The structure looms in front of you--sleek, modular, and distinctly industrial. The station is built for efficient refueling, with segmented docking areas for various freighter sizes, fuel lines tangled overhead like mechanical vines snaking down to heavy looking hoses attached to repulsers, and a series of elevated walkways crisscrossing the area.`
			choice
				`	(Get out of the bulky vehicle.)`
			`	While still outside the main area, you exit the vehicle and hear the fueling systems hum, punctuated by the occasional clicks of the fuel pumps. There's a faint sulfuric tang in the air intermixed with the radioactive metallic dust. Large screens display fuel prices and tank levels, while cargo repulsers zip around, transporting supplies to waiting ships. You begin to make your way through narrow steps and low guardrails leading up to a platform overlooking the main fueling bay.`

He's leaned back, catching his breath and wiping the sweat from his brow. The worker looks up as you near, his expression neutral but open, perhaps surprised to see someone from management on-site. His break seems brief, but he's got a minute or two before heading back to work--giving you the option to engage in conversation or simply move on.`

He's leaned back with a relaxed smile on his face as he whistles a cheerful tune, clearly enjoying a well-earned break. The worker's uniform is crisp, and his overall demeanor suggests high morale, perhaps a reflection of your choice to invest in excellent workplace safety and labor conditions.

			`	The worker seems lost in thought, occasionally wiping the sweat from his brow. He shifts slightly as you draw nearer, offering a subtle nod of acknowledgment, giving you the chance to either continue on or start a conversation with him. The reasons behind the plaque and the stones remain unclear, though their presence feels somber. You think back to Howard's message about your aggressive investment choice causing a "noteworthy incident."`

			`	You decide to strike up a conversation, and after a brief exchange, the worker relaxes when you clarify that you're not from management. His face softens as he shares his story. He grew up poor in the Dirt Belt, and came to Crossroads hoping for something better.`
			`	"I've been working hard, trying to give my kid a life I didn't have."`
			`	He shrugs as he says "Sure, the hours are long and it's tough sometimes, but it beats what you hear about some Syndicate jobs--unsafe, grueling work. At least here, the work's steady and it puts food on the table. That's more than I ever had growing up in the Dirt Belt." He checks the time and stands, dusting off his uniform.`
			`	"Thanks for the chat, but I've got a long night ahead. It's my kid's birthday, and I'm putting in extra hours so I can get them a cake. They're gonna love it."`

			`	You decide to strike up a conversation, and as you exchange pleasantries, the worker mentions how he grew up in the Dirt Belt. He talks about how tough life was back then, scraping by with whatever work he could find before coming to Crossroads in search of something better.`
			`	"I've been incredibly lucky," he says with a genuine smile. "This job--good pay, safe working conditions, benefits for my family--it's more than I ever imagined. I've heard stories about jobs in the Syndicate, how unsafe and grueling they can be. Heck, I've heard of other refueling stations at this very same logistics hub where people get injured and they're left to starve--can you imagine? I count my blessings every day."`
			`	He glances at his datapad and stands up, brushing off his uniform. "Thanks for the chat," he says warmly. "I've got to head back in. Calling it an early day today--need to grab a cake and set up a surprise birthday party for my kid. They're going to be thrilled!"`

			`	You decide to say hello and ask about the plaque, and the worker lets out a sharp, bitter scoff. "Management put it up after a fuel explosion killed someone," he says in a cold tone. "Injured dozens more, too. They have us handling some incredibly dangerous fuel, no safety gear, and quotas that are impossible to meet. We all knew it was a disaster waiting to happen. But management?" He pauses to wipe his brow.`

They got hurt bad enough that they couldn't keep working, and the burns covering their bodies left them in agony for days. Megaparsec didn't lift a finger to help, no medicine, no credits, nothing. We tried, but they didn't make it."`
			`	"Management won't admit they had anything to do with it, won't help their families or put their names on a plaque or anything. So a few of us put those stones there. Our own little way of remembering."`

			`	At the top of platform, you take in the sight below of hurried workers and a massive Container Transport docking, its intermodal containers full of Particle Cannons likely destined for Megaparsec Quicksilvers.`
			`	Fueling crews move quickly but with a certain impatience, functional but clearly worn gear clanking as they connect the repulsor-mounted refueling hoses to the Container Transport's ports. There's a faint tension in the air, an unspoken acknowledgment that time is money, as the fueling process proceeds with the workers more focused on speed than safety.`
			`	You take a breath of air that feels thick and grimy, carrying the faint stench of fuel. The environmental controls seem poorly maintained, leaving the atmosphere heavy and uncomfortable. The hum of machinery blends with the occasional cough from workers, who seem used to the less-than-ideal conditions. You see the worker from outside, who gives you a short nod before coughing into his arm and rushing to the next fueling hose.`

The workers frantically pull the volatile fuel hoses forward, the heavy hoses attached to worn repulsers that barely handle their weight. Workers shout over the roar of pumps, rushing to refuel, their movements hurried and desperate.`
			`	As you inhale, the air sears your lungs, almost choking you into a coughing fit. It's suffocating, laden with the sharp, toxic stench of volatile fuel. The entire platform feels like it's teetering on the edge of catastrophe. Every second here feels dangerous, the air thick with the threat of a disaster waiting to happen. The hum of machinery feels ominous against the gasping breaths of workers, whose tense, hurried movements suggest they're all too aware of the dangerous conditions around them. Each worker appears equally broken and sullen, and you can't make out the worker you saw earlier from the crowd.`
