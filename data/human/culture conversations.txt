# Note about Earth Day and Earth Hour:
# Earth Day (in 2023) is a day of awareness about climate change and occurs every 22nd of April. Earth Hour is an hour
# of blackout around cities worldwide, also to bring awareness to climate change, and it's observed on the last Saturday
# of March.

# Since Earth Day has become a quasi-'national day' for Earthlings in Endless Sky, it would be interesting to have Earth
# Hour be conflated with Earth Day as well, to demonstrate how people in a thousand years' time observe what we observe
# today and how its meaning has changed.

What was the bustling spaceport city is now completely still, and even though it is near midnight, the supertall buildings and skyscrapers are curiously dark; not a light is on for kilometers.`
			`	Despite this, the spaceport seems to still be operational, because the automated procedures of signing landing documents, refueling, and checking your ship's spaceworthiness are completed as you land. In the spaceport terminal, there are wax candles spaced out to bring some light into the now dark corridors. It's a strange sight for the most populated planet in human space.`

Today's Earth Day, when all the cities of Earth - and I mean all of them - participate in a total blackout. Even the Parliament building was out today. It makes us think about our origins; that we once lived on the soil without electricity, all confined to just this one planet here, divided and uncertain. Of course, people like me still have to keep working, but for other people it's a day off to enjoy what little wildlife and Earth us Earthlings have left, ironically. Do you have any other questions?`

Back then, there were a bunch of conflicts and disputes over resources and how we were fighting all over and digging it all up to power all those dirty, primitive cars, power plants, and factories we had back then. So as a show of unity against that people started celebrating Earth's natural beauty by bringing us back to our past."`

Many of the usually empty landing pads are occupied, and you notice a sizable crowd at the edge of the spaceport as you step out onto its rather untarnished apron. Some members of the crowd are obviously from offworld judging by their height, and there's even a few media crews standing by, although it looks like their camera drones are struggling with Burthen's gravity.`

			`	Each step takes significantly more effort than you're used to, but you eventually reach the crowd. From the signs that have been put up on the way, it looks like the "Burthen Triathlon" is taking place today, and the spaceport has been designated the finishing point. A couple of especially sturdy-looking marquees have been set up; the smaller one appears to be the administration tent, currently only accessible to event staff, while the other one is far larger and is catering food and drinks for the crowd nearby.`

			`	Thankfully, the walk to the catering tent is far shorter than the walk from your ship, but nevertheless you're exhausted by the time you drag your feet inside. A lot of effort has been put into this tent: the metal chairs are all sturdily-built to allow offworlders to pull themselves up, but cushioned as to not make it uncomfortable to sit in. A small firepit has been built in the middle of the tent, along with a couple fire extinguishers placed nearby, and the whole place is brightly lit in contrast to Burthen's typically chilly weather. Quite a few people, both Burthenians and offworlders, are mingling about here.`
			`	There's a counter in the corner with two levels, apparently so that the Burthenian attending it can serve both offwolders and locals. Alongside the typical drinks you've seen in spaceport bars and some local to the southern Core, the counter also offers a local drink called the "Antigrav" that claims to "ease visitors from Burthen's natural pull," and comes in a specially made glass, all for 30 credits.`

			`	Staying outside in the oppressive gravity and the chilly temperature, you move over to the sidelines and watch the large, portable screen that is broadcasting the leading competitors from above. It appears that competitors are divided into Burthenians and offworlders, with Burthenians wearing white helmets and offworlders wearing red helmets. It's nearing the end of the whole event; the competitor in front is named Abernathy, a stocky Burthenian apparently doing his eleventh Burthen Triathlon. Meanwhile, the leading offworlder is five hundred meters behind him, a competitor from Martini named Caldarone. Apparently, they've been at it for over 11 hours, beginning with a 1.5 kilometer swim, then a 40 kilometer bicycle ride, and finally a 10 kilometer run.`
			`	After a couple minutes, Abernathy emerges from behind a bend, camera drones chasing him. Cheers, whoops, and rather overly enthusiastic hollers erupt from the crowd, raising enormously as he dashes through the finishing straight, the drones now circling around him. Just over the crowd a loudspeaker announces, "And here comes the winner of the Syndicate Athletics Burthen Triathlon, the world triathlete champion, competitor number fifty-eight: Samuel Abernathy!"`

Being the center of the planet's extensive transportation system, it seems as if you are wading through thousands of Gagarians and offworlders in every atrium and hallway of this spaceport, as they do the same to make their connections on- and off-world.`
			`	But as you make your way into the central hall, you notice that, where you'd expect the greatest activity, everything has stopped.

Surrounding them is a cordon of guerrillas in their rosy CCOR uniforms, sizing up the public and the spaceport security around them with their rifles and pistols.`
			`	The painting guerrillas are busily finishing off the touches of what appears to be a statue of the burgundy and white emblem of the Confederated Councils, while a pile of rubble beside it suggests that a symbol of the local government once stood in its place.

And for near a century they have colluded to impose their designs on our worlds! The corporate insurrection in Novo Minho and the gang wars in the northern Outer Rim are an obvious extension of the arm of people like Alastair Korban, only leading to further suffering and bitter destruction in our region!`
			`	"But there is still hope. We can bring about the independence of Gagarin and unify this world that has been lost to the Syndicate-sponsored oligarchs and their cronies and puppet officials. We can reunite the Outer Rim and restore the prosperity stolen from us. We can form a new Confederated Councils and once again shine the light of Belenos across the entire galaxy!"`
			`	The gendarmes look around and consider the response of the crowd around them as the man finishes his speech to scattered applause. The speaker steps down and orders his guerrillas into formation before marching them out of the still crowd and into the back of a dusty, burgundy army van you hadn't noticed before, leaving the remains of the old statue scattered around the empty space.`
			`	You turn around and see the gendarme you ended up next to. He meets your eyes and recognizes your off-world air.`
			`	"Just an everyday interruption, Captain," he says. "Only nostalgists for the old cause. We get a dozen of these incidents a month." He seems to be interrupted by a buzz from the radio receiver at his hip and strides off into the crowd, leaving you on the ledge.`
			`	Slowly but surely, the spaceport snaps out of its shock and picks up its previous momentum, although as you turn around you pass two government-branded trucks mounted with cranes, almost certainly there to carry off the newly installed statue and to clean up the mess left behind by the guerrillas.`
