You see a decent looking mug with the text "<origin>" printed underneath an attractive, stylized representation of the spaceport you are presently standing in and pick it up to see how it feels. The handle is solid, not too small for your fingers, and the lip of it looks like it would be comfortable to drink out of.`

The item ends up back on the shelf with a giggle and a head-shake.`

Rhythmic wailing blends with the susurrant rain, filling the air as the coffin is followed closely by procession of mourners that look to be an extensive gathering of family. Even as it is placed into the van they do not leave the departed, a number of their hands placed on it as if pushing the person toward their final resting place. The two foremost mourners, a woman and a young man, climb in and take their seats next to it. Somewhere nearby, music begins to play as the vehicle slowly moves off.`
