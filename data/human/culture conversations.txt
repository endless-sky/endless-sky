# Note about Earth Day and Earth Hour:
# Earth Day (in 2023) is a day of awareness about climate change and occurs every 22nd of April. Earth Hour is an hour
# of blackout around cities worldwide, also to bring awareness to climate change, and it's observed on the last Saturday
# of March.

# Since Earth Day has become a quasi-'national day' for Earthlings in Endless Sky, it would be interesting to have Earth
# Hour be conflated with Earth Day as well, to demonstrate how people in a thousand years' time observe what we observe
# today and how its meaning has changed.

Quite a few people, both Burthenians and offworlders, are mingling about here.`

It's nearing the end of the whole event; the competitor in front is named Abernathy, a stocky Burthenian apparently doing his eleventh Burthen Triathlon. Meanwhile, the leading offworlder is five hundred meters behind him, a competitor from Martini named Caldarone.

We can reunite the Outer Rim and restore the prosperity stolen from us. We can form a new Confederated Councils and once again shine the light of Belenos across the entire galaxy!"`

The back of the hangar has a reinforced glass cargo door cracked open, perhaps by mistake. You peer inside to see large, sealed tarps stretched across the area, some draped over cargo crates, others covering entire sections. One enormous tarp appears big enough to be covering a whole ship.

The air has a faint chemical tang to it, and ahead, two figures move methodically between the tarps towards the door.`

The larvae attach to metal - usually ship hulls, but it can be mining equipment, or anything, really - and secrete an enzyme that corrodes the surface, breaking it down so they can form a cocoon around themselves.

The buildings, made mostly of durable plastic resin, form a quaint but near-uniform red-brown landscape, in sharp contrast to the small yellow pub in the center. The spaceport is quiet, but the low hum of activity from a nearby oil drill gives it some life. As you are entering the pub, you spot an announcement on a bulletin board:`
			`	"Guided Tour: Hybrid Crop Research Village - an exceptional hub of field-based research led by the Cornucopia College of Agriculture, nestled within captivating landscapes!"`

The village itself appears a small yet dynamic community, centered around a sleek, glass-paneled laboratory and greenhouse emanating reddish-yellow light. Dotted around are modest plastic resin apartment buildings. The entire community is surrounded by an expansive field containing rows and rows of crops.`
			`	You get off the bus and are immediately ushered into the laboratory by a young-looking tour guide, along with half a dozen other tourists. She has a small nametag that reads:`

			`	"Welcome to our guided tour of Bluestone's Hybrid Crop Research Village! Here, our dedicated scientists harness the secrets of native flora.

				goto chlorophyll
			label awkward
			`	There is an awkward pause as Zea scans the group. After another moment the tour guide sighs lightly, "Well, it's chlorophyll." Visibly trying to downplay the moment, she adds, "No worries - let's move on.`
			label chlorophyll
			`	"These pigments on our native plants are distinct from Earth's chlorophyll. Green chlorophyll actually captures red light fairly well, but not as well as a cyan pigment. Our planet's reddish hue can also be deceiving - near-infrared light, an invisible light just beyond what humans can see, is what our native plants truly thrive on. The vegetation can capture those wavelengths of light with remarkable efficiency. By deciphering their genetic blueprints, we've identified key adaptations that can be hybridized into crops found on Earth or other worlds to enhance their resilience in the low-light environments of cooler stars."`
			`	You are then led outside to a small garden of native grasses and lichens next to the laboratory. "And now, take a closer look at our fascinating native species. Notice their muted blue and near-black colors - this isn't just a quirk of nature, but a vital adaptation that enhances absorption of red and near-infrared light on our dim planet. Their extensive root systems delve deep into the sparse soil, allowing them to efficiently access as much nutrients and water as possible under low-light conditions. Now, the leaves on these grasses are much larger and flatter than what you'd see on similar grasses on planets with brighter sunlight. Can anyone tell me why our plants might have larger and flatter leaves than somewhere like Earth?"`
			choice
				`	"Larger leaves maximize surface area to capture more light."`

				goto nativeplants

			`	The guide makes eye contact with most of the group for an uncomfortable beat as she awaits a response. When none come, the tour guide says, "Well, it's because larger, thinner leaves maximize the surface area for light absorption... ummm, let's look at some grasses now."`
			label nativeplants
			`	She walks up to one of the grasses and gesture at its leaves. "The large, thin leaves of our native plants are designed to maximize surface area to better collect infrared rays, ensuring they capture every photon they can. These features collectively enable our plants to thrive where Earth plants would struggle."`
			`	The tour continues as you enter a state-of-the-art greenhouse. Inside, hybrid crops flourish under controlled lighting that varies from yellow to red, as you feel warm from the heat lamps above. Zea points at a deep pot filled with a muted blue-black wheatgrass that has huge, delicate leaves. "Here, traditional Earth crops like wheat have been endowed with traits inspired by our native species. Observe the broader, darker leaves that boost photosynthetic efficiency in low-light conditions. These modifications not only help the plants harness energy from our reddish sunlight, but can be used across the galaxy to grow food where it was impossible before!"`
			`	You feel the tour drawing to a close as the tour guide gathers the group for a final discussion.`
			`	"Thank you for joining us on this exploration of the cutting edge of hybrid crops. I hope you leave here today with a renewed appreciation and curiosity for the foods you eat and the remarkable plants that surround us."`
