# Note about Earth Day and Earth Hour:
# Earth Day (in 2023) is a day of awareness about climate change and occurs every 22nd of April. Earth Hour is an hour
# of blackout around cities worldwide, also to bring awareness to climate change, and it's observed on the last Saturday
# of March.

# Since Earth Day has become a quasi-'national day' for Earthlings in Endless Sky, it would be interesting to have Earth
# Hour be conflated with Earth Day as well, to demonstrate how people in a thousand years' time observe what we observe
# today and how its meaning has changed.

From the signs that have been put up on the way, it looks like the "Burthen Triathlon" is taking place today, and the spaceport has been designated the finishing point. A couple of especially sturdy-looking marquees have been set up; the smaller one appears to be the administration tent, currently only accessible to event staff, while the other one is far larger and is catering food and drinks for the crowd nearby.`

A lot of effort has been put into this tent: the metal chairs are all sturdily-built to allow offworlders to pull themselves up, but cushioned as to not make it uncomfortable to sit in. A small firepit has been built in the middle of the tent, along with a couple fire extinguishers placed nearby, and the whole place is brightly lit in contrast to Burthen's typically chilly weather. Quite a few people, both Burthenians and offworlders, are mingling about here.`
			`	There's a counter in the corner with two levels, apparently so that the Burthenian attending it can serve both offworlders and locals. Alongside the typical drinks you've seen in spaceport bars and some local to the southern Core, the counter also offers a local drink called the "Antigrav" that claims to "ease visitors from Burthen's natural pull," and comes in a specially made glass, all for 30 credits.`

It's nearing the end of the whole event; the competitor in front is named Abernathy, a stocky Burthenian apparently doing his eleventh Burthen Triathlon. Meanwhile, the leading offworlder is five hundred meters behind him, a competitor from Martini named Caldarone. Apparently, they've been at it for over 11 hours, beginning with a 1.5 kilometer swim, then a 40 kilometer bicycle ride, and finally a 10 kilometer run.`

The corporate insurrection in Novo Minho and the gang wars in the northern Outer Rim are an obvious extension of the arm of people like Alastair Korban, only leading to further suffering and bitter destruction in our region!`

We can reunite the Outer Rim and restore the prosperity stolen from us. We can form a new Confederated Councils and once again shine the light of Belenos across the entire galaxy!"`
			`	The gendarmes look around and consider the response of the crowd around them as the man finishes his speech to scattered applause. The speaker steps down and orders his guerrillas into formation before marching them out of the still crowd and into the back of a dusty, burgundy army van you hadn't noticed before, leaving the remains of the old statue scattered around the empty space.`

			`			- The oceans of Buccaneer Bay are full of jawless, fish-like creatures commonly known as Buccaneer Bay Boneheads that have a single, bone-like plate over their head and body, an oversized skull!`
			`			- Ecologically, they are commonly filter feeders, deposit feeders, and grazers, consuming tiny organisms or detritus from the water, sediment, or ocean floor.`
			`			- Dish Fish differ from other Buccaneer Bay Boneheads: they have a nearly perfectly circular head-plate, three small horns to fend off predators, and no eyes because they live on deep, low-light ocean floors.`
			`			- These traits make a Dish Fish head-plate the perfect souvenir dish: round, sealed, with a built-in tripod. Get yours today!`
			`	The waiter returns, and the plate is distinctive. He brings out a sizable ivory disc, the bone smooth and polished, balanced by three tapering horns on the table. On the plate itself sits a single charred tail, skewered and grilled until the skin crackles. It looks both impressive and appetizing.`

			`		MS in Agronomy`
			`		Cornucopia College of Agriculture`
			`	"Welcome to our guided tour of Bluestone's Hybrid Crop Research Village! Here, our dedicated scientists harness the secrets of native flora.

			`	There is an awkward pause as Zea scans the group. After another moment the tour guide sighs lightly, "Well, it's chlorophyll." Visibly trying to downplay the moment, she adds, "No worries - let's move on.`
			label chlorophyll
			`	"These pigments on our native plants are distinct from Earth's chlorophyll. Green chlorophyll actually captures red light fairly well, but not as well as a cyan pigment. Our planet's reddish hue can also be deceiving - near-infrared light, an invisible light just beyond what humans can see, is what our native plants truly thrive on. The vegetation can capture those wavelengths of light with remarkable efficiency. By deciphering their genetic blueprints, we've identified key adaptations that can be hybridized into crops found on Earth or other worlds to enhance their resilience in the low-light environments of cooler stars."`
			`	You are then led outside to a small garden of native grasses and lichens next to the laboratory. "And now, take a closer look at our fascinating native species. Notice their muted blue and near-black colors - this isn't just a quirk of nature, but a vital adaptation that enhances absorption of red and near-infrared light on our dim planet. Their extensive root systems delve deep into the sparse soil, allowing them to efficiently access as much nutrients and water as possible under low-light conditions. Now, the leaves on these grasses are much larger and flatter than what you'd see on similar grasses on planets with brighter sunlight. Can anyone tell me why our plants might have larger and flatter leaves than somewhere like Earth?"`

			label "native plants"
			`	She walks up to one of the grasses and gesture at its leaves. "The large, thin leaves of our native plants are designed to maximize surface area to better collect infrared rays, ensuring they capture every photon they can. These features collectively enable our plants to thrive where Earth plants would struggle."`
			`	The tour continues as you enter a state-of-the-art greenhouse. Inside, hybrid crops flourish under controlled lighting that varies from yellow to red, as you feel warm from the heat lamps above. Zea points at a deep pot filled with a muted blue-black wheatgrass that has huge, delicate leaves. "Here, traditional Earth crops like wheat have been endowed with traits inspired by our native species. Observe the broader, darker leaves that boost photosynthetic efficiency in low-light conditions. These modifications not only help the plants harness energy from our reddish sunlight, but can be used across the galaxy to grow food where it was impossible before!"`
			`	You feel the tour drawing to a close as the tour guide gathers the group for a final discussion.`
			`	"Thank you for joining us on this exploration of the cutting edge of hybrid crops. I hope you leave here today with a renewed appreciation and curiosity for the foods you eat and the remarkable plants that surround us."`

			`You step down onto the landing pad and your breath makes a white halo. The spaceport is unusually foggy, and the chilling wind causes a reflexive shiver to run up the base of your neck.`
			`	A grizzled man emerges from the fog with an easy, unhurried gait, a laser rifle slung over one shoulder. A hulking beast lumbers at his side: a horse-sized hound cloaked in heavy, wooly fur rimmed with frost. Two enormous tusks thrust from its muzzle like pale sabers. Steam billows from its flared nostrils as it turns its head almost lazily toward you. Its eyes carry a grim patience.`

			`You steady yourself on the floating city-ship as the necklace of barges, docks, and gantries creak and sway under the influence of Mainsail's endless ocean waves. Salt spray stings your face as you head out towards the ring. One barge rocks close, its deck slick with algae, while a local fearlessly walks a four-legged whale-like creature on a leash - a seal-sized mass of compact muscle under slate fur, with webbed paws that click on the planks, a long whiskered snout bristling with needlelike teeth and a broad, flattened tail that wags with anticipation.`
			`	The local catches you gawking, flashes a salt-creased grin and calls, "Never seen a seadog before?`

Bred some four centuries ago in the ateliers of this very planet, they marry old water-dog stock with dolphin and otter blood, with a touch of beaver for the tail, crocodile for the jaws, and barracuda for the strike," he says with a wink. "They'll nose out a school, haul in the finest fish, and lay a damp, grateful head upon your boots - a prized rarity since the Republic put a lid on the gene labs."`

In a spray of salt the steely creature hauls them off, and the boat recedes like a chariot of Poseidon into the harbor haze.`

			choice
				`	(Follow the sign.)`
				`	(Ignore the sign and keep walking.)`
					decline
			`	Curious, you decide to investigate, turning into a narrow street that feels like an echo of Old Vienna. A handful of historic-looking buildings line the cobblestone path, their facades adorned with dramatic stonework and flowery tilework. A small concert hall, labeled "Bach Collegium Konzertsaal", hums with the faint sound of string instruments tuning. Nearby, the aroma of rich, chocolatey coffee drifts from a small coffeehouse.`
			`	Outside the coffeehouse, a man at a marble table sips his coffee while reading a local newspaper. You can see the front page with the headline: "Mitreibender Mozart mit dem Bach Collegium Konzertsaal", featuring a photograph of a smiling conductor at the center of a small orchestra. On the reader's plate rests a bright pink sponge cake, its color fitting right in with the rich tones of the street.`
			`	As you linger, a well-dressed older woman approaches. Her voice, imbued with a musical rhythm, greets you with a hearty "Gruess Gott!`
			`	"Not many offworld visit Kleinwean, which is a shame, as you can see it's quite the New Austrian 'gem'," she remarks with a wink. "I was on my way to the concert - my husband is sick - and I would hate for his ticket to go to waste. Would you do me the honor of taking it?"`
			choice
				`	(Accept the ticket.)`
				`	(Politely decline.)`
					goto declined
			`	You graciously accept the invitation and follow her to the intimate concert hall. Despite its modest size, the hall houses a full orchestra. Once you're comfortably seated, the conductor steps forward, clears his throat, and in a measured tone declares:`
			`	"Willkommen im ehrwuerdigen Bach Collegium Konzertsaal! Wir sind Lichtjahre von Mozarts Heimat entfernt, aber auch im Zentrum von Kleinwean! Geniessen Sie das Konzert!"`
			`	The words hang in the air as you notice the conductor's smile, strikingly familiar from the newspaper photograph. With his invitation to lose yourself in the performance still echoing, the orchestra begins a stirring rendition of Mozart. The notes dance through the air with crystalline clarity, and you even recognize one or two of the melodies, each serving as a bridge to the Old Vienna of Earth.`
			`	Even after the performance, you feel the sound of music resonate in your bones as you glance back one more time at New Austria's hidden cultural enclave.`
				goto backtoship

			`	You thank her kindly but explain that you're not in the mood for a concert. She nods understandingly, her eyes softening with disappointed yet gracious acceptance. You finish your exploration of the "Kleinwean Bezirk", absorbing the ambiance of the cobblestone street as the scents of coffee mingle with the sound of music.`
