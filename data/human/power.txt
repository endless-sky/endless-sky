	"mass" 2
	"outfit space" -2
	"energy capacity" 750
	description "With a powerful enough generator, many ships do not need batteries at all. The one exception is projectile weapons, which usually require a burst of energy far exceeding what the generator produces. Supercapacitors provide just enough energy storage for those weapons, without requiring you to install a bulky battery pack."

	"outfit space" -10
	"energy capacity" 4000
	description "A ship can run without batteries if its generator's instantaneous power output is higher than the total energy consumption of its systems, but batteries make it possible to store up energy when it is not needed and thus to use a much smaller and cheaper generator."

	"outfit space" -20
	"energy capacity" 8800
	description "This battery pack has more than twice the energy capacity of the most basic model, allowing your ship to engage in combat for longer periods of time before running out of energy. Some pilots have even been known to install these in lieu of any generator at all, trusting that they can reach their destination planet and recharge before running out of battery power, but that is a risky proposition."

	"energy capacity" 19200
	description "This medium-sized battery pack is intended for ships that need to fire the occasional salvo of high-powered weaponry without running out of energy. As with all battery packs, relying on batteries is risky if combat lasts long enough for them to become depleted."

	description "This is a large battery pack designed for ships that may occasionally have high power needs but do not want the expense or the heat associated with a more powerful ship's generator."

	"energy capacity" 46000
	description "For most ships that require this much power, a larger generator makes more sense than a battery this size. However, battery packs have the advantage that they generate no heat, so some captains use them instead of powerful generators if they do not expect to be in combat frequently or for extended periods of time."

	"heat generation" 5.7
	description "This is a relatively large fuel cell. Other generators are available that produce more energy and fit into a smaller space, but they are much more expensive. As a result, large civilian ships that will not be frequently in combat often come equipped with these fuel cells."

	description "This is the largest fuel cell available, larger than some nuclear reactors but much, much more affordable. Many captains on a tight budget are willing to put up with one of these until they can raise the money for something more efficient."

	description "Nucleovoltaic generators are a relatively recent generator technology that harvests energy from the decay of a radioisotope source and converts it directly into electricity. They are the most powerful generator that relies on nuclear decay instead of an active nuclear chain reaction."

	description "A Breeder Reactor is a more efficient fission reactor that captures some of the neutron radiation produced by the reactor and uses it to enrich more fuel. They are also, of course, bigger and more expensive as a result."
