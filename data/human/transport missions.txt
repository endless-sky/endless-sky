			`	As you are conversing a bearded man and a rough-looking teenage boy enter the bar and begin looking around the room. "That's our captain," she says. "Please, you have to help us. There's a service tunnel that connects to the back entrance of the bar. We can escape through there."`
			`	You've heard of these service passageways: the most dangerous part of this lawless station, dimly lit and seldom traveled, except by drug addicts and prostitutes. This whole thing might just be a ruse to lure you into one, where they can attack you without anyone interfering. "No," says the boy, "if we head for the service tunnel, they'll be sure to notice us. Let's just stay at the table until they go away."`

			`	The boy stands up. "Wait ten seconds, then head to the tunnel," he says. He walks into the bathroom, which is right next to the back entrance that she pointed out. You wait for a few seconds, then stand up. "Don't run," says the girl. "Walk slowly. Pretend. You've had a bit too much to drink. We're headed out back to find some privacy." You don't dare look behind you to see if the men in the doorway are watching you.`
			`	Finally, you reach the back entrance, and she spins the wheel to unlock it. The hinges squeal, but it opens enough for you to squeeze through. You find yourselves in a narrow corridor lit only by flickering sodium lamps. In the yellow lamplight her face and hands look pale, jaundiced. The floor of the corridor is littered with beer bottles and discarded hypodermic needles. To one side of the door are several over-stuffed trash cans. As you step into the corridor, a rat scurries away into the darkness.`
			`	A few seconds later, watching through the open airlock, you see the boy walk out of the bathroom. He can't help stealing a quick glance towards the men in the doorway, after which he quickly ducks through the airlock and slams the door shut. "Run!" he whispers.`
			`	You begin running down the corridor, in the direction of your ship. You pass a man, slumped over in a corner; there is no time to see if he is dead, or just sleeping. In places the lights have gone out, and it is so dim that you can barely see the floor beneath you. Your footsteps pounding on the metal decking ring terribly loud up and down the empty hallway.`
			`	Eventually the passageway widens out into a maintenance room, full of humming equipment and large tanks. You duck behind one of them and listen for sounds of pursuit. "I think we're safe," says the boy. He walks over to another airlock door on the opposite wall and tugs it open. Light pours in, almost blinding at first. You are looking out into the rimway, the main passage in this ring of the station. Crowds of people are walking past, paying no attention to you. He glances quickly in both directions, then gestures for you to follow.`
				goto ship
			
			label outside
			`	You wait at the table, pretending that you are busy placing a drink order. The men at the door do not leave. Instead, they step into the room and begin circling around the edge of it. "What berth is your ship in?" asks the boy. You tell him. "Wait ten seconds, then follow," he says. He stands up and walks through the door. The searchers glance at him as he leaves, but they must be looking for two people together, because they ignore him.`
			`	The searchers approach the bar and begin talking to one of the bartenders. You and the girl stand up. "Walk slowly," she hisses under her breath. "Saunter. Don't run." You put an arm around her shoulders and do your best to act like an ordinary bar patron headed home with a new friend after having a bit too much to drink. You don't dare to glance at the bar to see if you are being watched.`
			`	Finally you reach the door. You are in the rimway, the main passage in this ring of the station. It is crowded and brightly lit. You quicken your pace slightly and begin walking toward your ship, still afraid that if you break into a run, you will attract attention. The girl keeps glancing at the shop windows that you pass by: checking the reflection to see if anyone is following you. "They're leaving the bar," she says. And then, "They're walking in the other direction. I think we're safe."`
			`	You pass a narrow doorway, probably an entrance to one of the service tunnels. The boy is standing there, holding a gun by his side. His grim expression softens somewhat when he sees you approaching.`

			`	You quickly make your way back to your ship. As soon as the door has closed behind you, all three of you breathe a sigh of relief. A second later, the baby begins to wail, loudly.

Along the way, you got to hear some of their music, which is mostly characterized by frenzied instrumentals, a very energetic brass section, and bizarre lyrics. One day while you were in transit, they nearly drove you insane by playing their catchy but nonsensical song "Henhouse In Your Soul" for four hours straight, but other than that they have been good passengers, and their stage manager gives you an incredibly generous payment of <payment>.`

About thirty minutes into the concert, the energy of the crowd and the surreal lyrics finally begin to soak in, and rather than seeming meaningless their music feels fraught with meaning that hovers just beyond your grasp.`
			`	Finally the band announces that their last song will be "Sad Archie." You've never heard of it, but the fans scream in approval. It's a slow, ballad-like song about a man named Archie who lives forever and is sad because the friends he makes all grow old and die. Archie has a pet dragon, and he builds a beautiful house for the dragon, but the dragon dies young. Archie is so sad seeing the dragon's house empty and gathering dust that he rents it out to some friends, but they fight with each other and trash the place. The story makes no sense, but some of the fans are wiping away tears as the song ends.`

			`	The basic concept of the poster seems to be that instead of altering the climate of a planet through brute force, it ought to instead be feasible to use a properly timed nudge in the right direction to cause the climate to shift toward a new equilibrium point that supports greater biological complexity. This student seems to think that planets naturally "want" to grow more complex and support more life, but that they sometimes get "stuck" in less optimum states.`

			`	"Tundra's snow covered surface only exacerbates the problem, reflecting most of the star's light back into space," Nolan explains. "This means that we need to both alter the atmosphere in order for it to retain more heat and alter the surface in order for it to reflect less heat."`
			`	Amy rolls out a map of the entire planet onto the table. Different regions of the surface are color coded, and a large red spot in the planet's southern hemisphere sticks out to you.`
			`	"Tundra has very low volcanic activity, but seismic mapping has lead us to this area." Amy circles the red spot with her finger. "Magma from the planet's mantle is building up under this area of the crust, which lucky for us is unusually thin. Still, it could be another ten thousand years before the magma builds up enough pressure under the surface to cause a supereruption, melting the snow around it and releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere that over time will raise the global temperatures."`

			`	Nolan answers, "The people who live near the volcano will need to evacuate the area with all their belongings. The Republic should provide any assistance needed for the evacuation. As for how we will cause the volcano to erupt, we need something energetic enough to crack the planet's crust in the location of the volcano, releasing the pressure that the magma is causing to spark an eruption. That's where we bring in another asteroi--"`
			`	"No, no, no!" the Republic representative exclaims, cutting Nolan off mid-sentence. "The Republic will not gain a reputation for crashing asteroids into its own planets. The consequences of such an action could be disastrous should it go wrong! And in what way will this warm the planet when the resulting volcanic winter could last decades and only result in an even colder climate? Are you not even old enough to remember how a supereruption on Hope caused the evacuation of the entire planet? If the people of Tundra are this desperate to terraform their planet then normal techniques should be employed, none of this 'equilibrium mapping' nonsense."`
			`	"Sir," Amy speaks up with a stern tone of voice, "we have already been authorized by the Republic to undergo this terraforming experiment, so unless you have half a teraton of cheap explosives, we're going to need to use an asteroid. The volcanic winter can be easily avoided by having a fleet of freighters sweep the volcanic ash out of the atmosphere, meaning we'll get the benefits of the greenhouse gases without the detriments of volcanic ash reflecting Cebalrai's heat back into space. No one knew the volcano on Hope was going to erupt, but we can prepare for this eruption and take steps to mitigate the problems." Amy looks the representative straight in the eyes and smirks. "We're scientists, we have this handled."`
			`	The representative falls silent. After a moment of thinking, he says "Captain, I need you to take me to Parliament.
