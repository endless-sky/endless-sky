#	1. Conversations
#		a. "meetupX" is a special label I use to keep conversations organized. These labels indicate the next spot where conversation threads meet back up, regardless of chosen options. They are numbered sequentially for ease-of-use.
#		b. You may notice "goto" markers just prior to the dialogue label they are meant to be paired with. This is to cut down on mistakes during editing / additions to conversations.
#		c. "branch" markers are linked to "branchX" labels to keep track of branch labels vs. regular dialogue labels vs. meetup labels.
#		d. "questions" is a special label I use for certain missions where the player can ask a series of questions, but eventually has to say "yes" or "no". These are single-line recursive; they take up less space and do not visibly repeat in-game.

			`As you wander the spaceport, you gaze upon the massive freighters, majestic warships, and luxurious transports docked next to your own insignificant vessel. A subtle stab of envy worms its way into your heart. But for all the beauty and glamour of these expensive ships, they are matched only by the pride you carry in your own humble spaceship...

			`	A pleasant female voice interrupts your daydreaming. "Oh, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to disturb you. I did the same thing when I got my first ship." Beside you stands a remarkably beautiful woman in her mid-twenties; her long auburn hair falls in natural streaks and waves, framing a thin, pleasant face.`

			`	You point to a well-polished, impressively-painted Firebird. The woman laughs and skeptically asks, "Oh, really?" She reads off the name printed across the hull. "'The Wandering Rogue'. That's a really impressive ship you've got there, captain. But you better run - it looks like they're taking off without you."`
			choice
				`	"What?"`
			`	The Firebird primes its thrusters, lifts off the pad, and launches away. You stand idly, dumbfounded at your poor luck.`
			`	"I guess they're coming back for you, right? You know, since you're the captain. Can't have a ship without a captain."`
			choice
				`	"That's right. They're just going on a pleasure cruise of sorts. While I take care of very important business here. Because I'm the captain."`
					goto business
				`	"It seems I've been caught. It was for a good cause, though!"`
			`	She laughs. "A good cause? What, trying to impress me?"`
			choice
				`	"Yes..."`
				`	"No..."`
			`	She grins and rolls her eyes. "That's really not necessary. It's impressive enough that you're out here, piloting your own ship and making your own way, even if it's not some big warship." She smiles at you. "Honestly."`
				goto meetup2

				goto meetup2
		
			label meetup2
			`	Her smile hangs for a moment, then turns to a sigh. "It's a real shame though, making new captains into paupers, just so the banks can make themselves rich off other people's hard work."`
			choice
				`	"I'm not sure about that. Banks are often made out to be the enemy, but historically speaking, banks have allowed private business to flourish by providing security, allowing for collective funding, and giving the average person a safety net without relying on the government or communal goodwill. Even if they do take certain excesses and breed financial corruption when not kept in check, they're a necessary institution for free trade in modern galactic society."`
				`	"You know, I think you're right. No matter how I look at it, the rise of centralized finance has led to an irrevocable disparity in individual wealth. Look at all the great financial disasters of the past - before 'credit' existed, wealth could only be measured locally. Loss of wealth in one region was balanced by gain in another. Now, how much is a building really 'worth'? How about a starship? Even a person? It's all relative, according to inscrutible finance on a galactic scale, and we're all just trying to keep up before our lives become worthless."`
					goto disparity
				`	"BURN THE BANKS!"`
					goto burn
				`	"I guess. I don't really have an opinion."`
					goto guess
			`	The woman appears genuinely surprised. "You might be right. But don't we have one of those excesses right here? How long did you have to dream about this moment before it became a reality? How hard did you have to work? And now they're breaking your back for more - and interest! It's disgusting. Shouldn't there be a middle ground?"`
				goto meetup3
			label guess
			`	The woman stares thoughtfully. "That's fair. But I wonder if that kind of uncertainty is what allows banks to exploit new pilots with so-called 'financial aid'."`
				goto meetup3
			label burn
			`	The woman laughs, then in a raucous tone responds, "A bonfire of banknotes! And kindling of the bankers! All debts forgiven!"`
				goto meetup3
			label disparity
			`	The woman nods. "That's a surprisingly detailed criticism. Most people who disagree with the private finance industry are far less eloquent. I think it'll serve you well, once you get out from under your current obligation to it."`
			
			label meetup3
			`	You feel a small pang of nausea at the mention of your own outstanding debt. The woman offers a look of pity and understanding. "I'm sorry. No matter how you look at it, it's just not fair."`
			`	The woman looks around for a moment, then exclaims, "Oh! But I had a reason for all this, and believe it or not, it's related. Now that I've taken up so much of your time, let me introduce myself - my name is Alexandra Merrin. May I ask your name?"`
			choice
				`	"I'm <first> <last>."`
				`	"My name is <first> <last>, at your service, my dear."`

			`	"I'm a scout for a special courier firm. We look for new captains who bought their ships in debt, and are struggling to make due. We front enough money to forgive their debt in return for a few deliveries, passenger runs, you get the gist. Sort of like a network of amateur couriers spread across the Republic."`
			choice
				`	"That sounds a lot like spaceport job postings. What's the difference?"`
					goto postings
				`	"Forgive their debt? Sure, I've heard that one before."`
					goto forgive
			
			label postings
			`	Alexandra smiles knowingly. "The difference is, we have a reliable courier, so we can cut expenses. We pass the savings on to couriers like you so you can get out of debt immediately. Supposing you took out a 500,000 credit loan to buy your ship, that's over 295,000 credits in interest by the end of the year. And all that assuming the bank gave you a 'fair' 0.3% daily interest rate."`
				goto meetup5
			label forgive
			`	Alexandra nods. "Too good to be true, right? Here." She hands you her datapad. Graphs and statistics convey a detailed yet readable analysis. "As you can see, by spreading out our network of couriers, the average time from request to delivery is cut by over 40%. Combined with a near-zero tolerance policy of abandoned cargo, high-end clients are willing to pay hefty sums for the faster, more reliable courier service we provide." She pauses as you examine the analysis. "In essence, we try to provide the key benefits of a professional shipping company without the bureaucracy, which nets our couriers the lion's share of profit from each run."`
			choice
				`	"Sounds straightforward enough to me."`
					goto straightforward
				`	"I'm not buying it. How do you justify passing that much money on to a new courier?"`
					goto buying
			label straightforward
			`	She smiles. "And I haven't even mentioned the best part; you'll get paid up front, so you can pay your debt immediately - no loan interest spoiling every delivery you make." She takes the datapad back. "Assuming you took out a 500,000 credit loan to buy your ship, that's over 295,000 credits in interest by the end of the year. And all that assuming the bank gave you a 'fair' 0.3% daily interest rate.`
				goto meetup5
			label buying
			`	She rubs her chin thoughtfully. "I won't sugarcoat it. The 'new courier' branch of Liekedeeler is more of a charity service for struggling pilots. But with enough couriers, it keeps us in business while testing the waters for skilled couriers interested in working with us beyond their initial debt." She takes the datapad back. "Most pilots are happy to walk out right there, seeing as they've paid off a 500,000 credit loan. I don't blame them, since they've also avoided paying close to 295,000 credits in interest. And all that assuming the bank gave a 'fair' 0.3% daily interest rate."`

Yeah, there's a lot of illegal stuff that's also wrong, but between illegal and immoral, there's a pretty gray line. Wrongfully-convicted criminals, untaxed goods for Dirt Belt workers, and whatever the Republic decides is evil tomorrow. You're sounding pretty high and noble up there. Let's wait until your family is dying of a Dirt Belt disease and the only medicine left to try has been outlawed or red-taped behind Republic bureaucracy."`
			`	She pauses a moment. "And of course, we also smuggle a lot of drugs, because who doesn't love 'em? Look, if you don't want to get involved, no one is forcing you. But if you have a change of heart for any reason, why don't you head on over to Earth?"`

After exchanging goodbyes, you peruse your wardrobe, sync your datapad to Earth's transportation network, and head to the transfer station below the multi-tiered spaceport.`
			`	The transportation system, encased within the monolithic concrete spaceport, is a tantalizing spiderweb of confusing maps, terminals, and security checkpoints. With a little luck and some guidance from several terse transportation officers, you make it to the correct terminal. Your datapad points you to a maglev shuttle bound for Dresden.`
			`	Before long, you reach the heart of the city. A short walk takes you to Dresden's grand opera house - one of the last remaining architectural achievements of the ancient city. You used to wonder why people took pilgrimages to Earth's cities, the cradle of humanity having long since abandoned extravagance and eclectic design in favor of standardized utility. But as you enter this opulent holdover from the past, you feel a spark of ancestral curiosity.`

			`	She smiles, looking out over the railing, then turns to you. "Oh, yeah. This is a good one. It's about a time-traveling cosplayer who falls in love with a medieval princess. He has to decide whether to stay and win her over while navigating the drama and intrigue of court life, or go back to his familiar-yet-dull timeline before it's too late. The story's been done before, but this is the best version. At least, that's what critics say."`

			`	You mutter something unkind under your breath, but must admit that her precautions seem justified.`
				goto meetup3

			`	The last stragglers wander to their seats, the lights dim, and the performance begins. A lone trumpet sounds, slowly accompanied by a flute and electric bagpipes. Alexandra points to a technician on one of the stage balconies. "He controls the sound AI linked to each of the instruments; he can change the audio quality based on where the scene takes place and add synchronized instruments on the fly."`

			`	The music dies down, and a young woman in an exceptionally gaudy dress - presumably the princess - appears on stage. "Dear departed mother, what doth am I to doeth? My faith is plain to see, my beauty turns all to me, and more humble I cannot be. But valued am I for naught but my immense social status! Can doth no man unlocketh the key to my heart?"`
			`	The princess begins singing, accompanied by chanting servants and acoustic guitars. Alexandra turns to you. "Navy Intelligence has been cracking down on near-Earth smuggling, and with the resources pulled from the South, they've got plenty of manpower to do it. Old buildings like this aren't built for snooping networks, and the dim lights and noise reduce the risk further. Plus, classier than dive bars."`
			choice
				`	"Much classier. I'm already getting into the very nuanced drama. Anyway, where do I come in?"`
				`	"Got it. So what kind of offers do you have for me?"`
			`	She clears her throat and speaks in a strong, low tone. "We'd like to bring you on as an independent smuggler. Straight credits for every job, no more contracts, and a happier you! Our little operation is expanding rapidly, and we need reliable pilots who can think for themselves. We'll also spread the word to our contacts, so you can pick up jobs from operations within Republic space. The flipside is that any liabilities you incur will be your own; we'll do our best to get you out of tricky situations, but we can't promise your safety." She pauses a moment. "For now, we need smugglers for three of our core operations."`

Food, Medicine, 'safe' pharmeceuticals, and high-quality weapons are in high demand on all pirate planets. But it gets a little more interesting than that. The Northern Pirates are gearing up for a fight, and the Southern Pirates are taking advantage of the instability to provide mercenary fleets and raid planets." She smiles.

But as they say, where there's a will, there's a way! There are also wanted individuals on both sides trying to leverage the position of each faction in what many consider an inevitable conflict. You know, convince so-and-so to agitate, prepare defenses, stay loyal, yadda yadda. It's a perfect opportunity for Liekedeeler to step in, provide a much-needed service, and acquire favors from individuals on both sides.

Oh, and the Syndicate's latest crackdown on freedom, civil rights, and religion has sparked quite the interest in censored materials. For example, Feminist groups all over Syndicate space have been clamoring for some recently-banned ancient manuscript by the name of 'Jane Eyre' So, that kind of stuff.

Certain Pirate Lords want to set up a legally-recognized Anarchic confederation. Ironic, I know, but the basic aim is to establish rules of warfare against the Republic and break the endless cycle of teens blowing themselves up for drugs and money. Between you and me, I think it's a ruse for one of the Pirate Lords to set themselves up as king, and every lord thinks it's going to be them. Regardless, they need guns, credits, and anything they can use against the Navy."`
			`	"The Southern Pirates are taking advantage of tensions in the South. They're weak and poor, but they're looking to change that. A few of them have set themselves up as War Merchants, buying and selling weapons, raiding poorly-defended planets, and establishing mercenary fleets. They have the basic needs any pirate world does, but they'll need people to smuggle wanted individuals in and out of the Republic and bring weapons and manufacturing equipment down South. But I'm going to warn you; our deals with the pirates are fragile at best. Liekedeeler has not agreed to deal in any operations labelled as 'crimes against humanity', but that doesn't mean they won't ask you. Be very, very careful who you deal with."`

A priest dressed in flamboyant purple robes and a ridiculously ornamented hat appears on the stage, surrounded by chubby male and female clergy members wearing similarly ornamented clothing.

			`	"Brothers and Sisters, who was it that first thought of God? What a fool, a simpleton! Add one letter, and you have man's true savior - Gold! Hallelujah!" The assembled clergy people clap merrily as coins rain from the ceiling. Several actors take their hats off to catch the coins. The sequence ends as the clergy retreats from the stage, leaving the lone priest.`

A massive pipe organ is wheeled in as knights and janissaries, suspended in harmonized flight, play a collection of brass and string instruments as they circle the pipe organ. Amidst the din, Mushiro hauls the priest's chest of gold off the stage.`

During a particularly climactic scene, the peasants fool an invading army into retreating by wearing their homemade knight costumes. Ultimately, his strong heart wins over the princess despite their class difference. As the Black Plague encroaches upon the kingdom, his kiss saves her from certain death, but has the side-effect of sending him back to modern times.`
