			`An elegantly looking lady is approaching you.`
			`	"Captain <last>, captain <last>! It is such an honour to meet you!"`
			choice
				`	"Wow, that's quite a greeting. Why is it an honour to meet me?."`
				`	"Hello, nice to meet you too."`
					goto "hello too"
				`	"Sorry, I don't have time to talk. I'm really busy."`
					defer
			`	She briefly smiles and says: "Well, I actually don't know you, but I just read your name on one of the cargo-manifests. And my experience is that this greeting works best if you need something from a spaceship captain."`
			label "hello too"
			`The lady continues talking;`
			`	"My name is Vanessa Oxygenpocket and I am part of the development team that is designing a highly cost-effective transport ship series at Southbound."`
			choice
				`	"Oxygenpocket, that is an uncommon name.`
				`	"What is the name of the series?"`
					goto "series name"
				`	"How is it cost effective?"`
					goto "cost effective"
				`	"And what help do you need from me?"`
					goto "help request"
			`	Ms. Oxygenpocket briefly looks surprised and then responds: `
			`	"Well, it might sound uncommon to people from a planet with a breathable atmosphere, but it is actually similar to Vanderberg, which means from the mountain, or Langley, which means woodland.`
			`	My grand-grand-grand parents lived on a planet with no atmosphere and oxygenpockets were as much a feature there as mountains and woodlands are on more habitable planets."`
			label "series name"
			`	She continues to talk about the ship, "The new series will be called Hauler VI and it will look like two Hauler III series side-by-side, but the cockpit and engine construction will obviously be a lot more complex."`
			label "cost effective"
			`	"The Hauler VI will have twice the cargo capacity of a III series." She thinks for a moment, "In it's current design the VI would however require more than twice the crew and we obviously needs to fix that before we can put it into the market."`
			choice
				`	"Ok, and how will it perform in combat?"`
					goto "combat effective"
				`	"Ok, and what help do you need from me?"`
					goto "help request"
			label "combat effective"
			`	"The VI will have twice the hull of a III-series, but it is also 25% slower and we are still working to get the shields up to the same level as the III-series."`
			label "help request"
			`	Ms. Oxygenpocket pauses for a moment and then continues; "We have an Hauler III that we upgraded with the cargo-handling systems for the VI so that we can test those new systems.`
			`Normally our own department would escort such prototypes, but there is a mole in our organisation and we have very strong competition from the Syndicated Shipyards.`
			`I only need you to help us travel to the nearby planet Skymoot to deliver sushi for a formal dinner. You will be paid for your expenses.`
			`Will you help us?"`
			choice
				`	"Isn't it dangerous to transport food in an untested prototype?`
					goto "risky transport"
				`	"Sure, I'll help you."`
					accept
				`	"Sorry, I don't have time to help you."`
					decline
			label "risky transport"
			`	"No it's actually more of a formality. Those systems have gone through a lot of simulation cycles already."`
