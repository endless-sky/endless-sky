# Giving an outfit "ammo" like this means that selling this outfit sells the "ammo," which is better UX for selling these outfits without having to sell the upgrades first, but this also makes it so that if you have space for upgrades, entering the outfitter asks you if you want to "buy ammo," which is not good UX. We either need a way to decouple those two mechanics (only ask to buy ammo if the "ammo" is actually in the ammo category?), or come up with a new keyword that only provides the "selling this sells that" behavior.

	description "Bunrodean shield relays are impressively efficient; while a similarly sized shield generator from another faction might be capable of providing more shield generation, Bunrodean shield relays provide a modest amount of shield generation for only a small amount of energy."
