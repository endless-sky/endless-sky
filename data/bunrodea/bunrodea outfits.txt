# Giving an outfit "ammo" like this means that selling this outfit sells the "ammo," which is better UX for selling these outfits without having to sell the upgrades first, but this also makes it so that if you have space for upgrades, entering the outfitter asks you if you want to "buy ammo," which is not good UX. We either need a way to decouple those two mechanics (only ask to buy ammo if the "ammo" is actually in the ammo category?), or come up with a new keyword that only provides the "selling this sells that" behavior.

	description "Bunrodean shield relays are impressively efficient; while a similarly sized shield generator from another faction might be capable of providing more shield generation, Bunrodean shield relays provide a modest amount of shield generation for only a small amount of energy."
	description "	Shield relays are able to be upgraded by installing shield boosters or limiters, which alter the performance of the shield relay. Each relay only has a limited number of slots for these upgrades, though."

	description "Some Bunrodean military captains argued that trading shield generation for energy efficiency is a foolish trade, while merchant captains looking to get the most out of their reactors argued that they could be more energy efficient. As such, shield relays are able to be customized to the owner's liking using external components."

	description "Although Bunrodea ships tend to rely on their shields for defense, some pilots will opt to install a nanite fabricator. These fabricators produce a steady stream of nanites that travel across the hull of the ship and repair any damage that they find."
	description "	Nanite fabricators are able to be upgraded by installing nanite enhancers or limiters, which alter the performance of the fabricator. Each fabricator only has a limited number of slots for these upgrades, though."

	description "The creation of nanite fabricators was spurred on by early contact between the Bunrodea and Korath. The hull-walking microbots of Korath System Cores allowed Korath ships to make repairs without the need of a spaceport, a trait that the Bunrodea favored for use in their scout vessels."

	description "Bunrodean solar panels are extremely efficient, and are even capable of powering smaller or less powerful warships. But be warned: while these solar cells can provide significant energy, that is not without the drawback of also generating waste heat that scales with the energy generated, which can be especially hazardous when near bright stars."

	description "Bunrodean reactors appear to be named after types of exotic stars that either once were or still are considered theoretical to humanity. A quark star was first discovered by humanity near the Shangri-La system during the 28th century, a star with core temperatures and pressures so extreme that quark matter is produced."

	description `The term "dark star" can have different meanings, but one definition of it is a star whose core is formed around a large amount of dark matter. Such exotic stars are theorized by humanity to have possibly existed among the first generations of stars in the universe, with concentrations of dark matter acting as nucleation sites.`
