	description "Bunrodean shield relays are impressively effiecent; while a similarly sized shield generator from another faction might be capable of providing more shield generation, Bunrodean shield relays provide a modest amount of shield generation for only a small amount of energy."
	description "	Shield relays are able to be upgraded by installing shield boosters or limiters, which alter the performance of the shield relay. Each relay only has a limited number of slots for these upgrades, though."

	description "Some Bunrodean military captains argued that trading shield generation for energy efficiency is a foolish trade, while merchant captains looking to get the best out of their reactors argued that they could be more energy efficient. As such, shield relays are able to be customized to the owner's liking using external components."

	description "Although Bunrodea ships tend to rely on their shields for defense, some pilots will opt to install a nanite fabricator. These fabricators produce a steady stream of nanites that travel across the hull of the ship and repair any damage that they find."
	description "	Nanite fabricators are able to be upgraded by installing nanite enhancers or limiters, which alter the performance of the fabricator. Each fabricator only has a limited number of slots for these upgrades, though."

	description "The creation of nanite fabricators was spurred on by early contact between the Bunrodea and Korath. The hull-walking robots of Korath System Cores allowed Korath ships to make repairs without the need of a spaceport, a trait that the Bunrodea favored for use in their scout vessesl."

	description "Bunrodean solar panels are extremely efficient, even being capable of powering smaller or less powerful warships. But be warned: while these solar cells can provide significant energy, that is not without the drawback of also generating waste heat that scales with the energy generated, which can be especially hazardous when near bright stars."
	description "	These cells must be installed on the mounting platform that comes with a solar battery to be used."

	description "Bunrodean reactors appear to be named after types of exotic stars that either once were or still are considered theoretical to humanity. A quark star was first discovered by humanity near the Shangri-La system during the 28th century, a star with core temperatures and pressures so extreme that quark matter is produced."

	description "The existence of the exotic stars that this Bunrodean reactor bears the name of is still unknown to humanity. An electroweak star is an exotic star that would be prevented from collapsing by the electroweak force as quarks are converted to leptons in the star's core."

	description "Whether Bunrodean reactors are actually powered by the theoretical forces that their names refer to or the Bunrodeans have simply discovered that these star types do exist and have only named their reactors after them is unknown. If the former is the case, then this reactor may be powered by the fusion of dark matter itself."

	description "During their wars with the Korath, it was not uncommon for Bunrodean vessels to be boarded by Korath raiders looking for technology and supplies to steal. As such, effective small arms weapons became an essential part of every Bunrodean crew to fight off any potential boarding parties."

	description "Given the lower size and thrust of Rift engines, Bunrodean ships aren't well known for their pursuit capabilities. But there are rumors among some Bunrodea of an ancient cache of engines more powerful than even those of the Korath that would allow any ship to zip across the stars like a comet and chase down any potential target."
