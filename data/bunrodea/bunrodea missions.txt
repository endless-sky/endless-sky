			`When you step off of your ship, you're startled by a small alien ship uncloaking right in front of you. Two elegant mantis-like aliens step off of the ships, each holding a strange looking weapon pointed directly at you. You look around to see if there's anyone else witnessing this, but you've landed at <origin>'s main spaceport in the middle of the night, leaving you as the only human in sight.`
			`	The aliens begin speaking to you in a language you don't understand. As one of them speaks, they sound almost robotic, as if they are speaking through a synthesizer. Taking a closer look, you spot what you can only guess are cybernetic modifications to parts of the alien's body. The other one has no such visible modifications, though.`

You recognize some of the systems on the map as those where you fought an alien fleet. In fact, the alien ship in front of you looks similar to those you fought. A single system within that region is highlighted. The aliens return to their ship, which becomes invisible again. Although you can't see it, you hear it take off and fly away.`
