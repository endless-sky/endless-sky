	description "The Tekkan is the one ship in the Bunrodean arsenal that favors turrets over forward facing guns. This allows the small and fast vessel to act as the primary means of anti-missile defense for larger Bunrodean ships that are lacking in turret mounts compared to their guns. Tekkans are also able to take advantage of the rarely used but powerful Locust Turrets, packing a considerable amount of damage into a small ship."

	description "The Kunai is the smallest of the Bunrodea's gunships, warships which focus heavily on the power of their forward-facing guns. Lacking any turret mounts and focusing more on turning quickly than traveling fast, the Kunai is highly susceptible to missile weaponry and must rely on other ships in the fleet to carry anti-missile turrets."

Some Chigiriki also double as missile platforms, raining down a walls of missiles so thick on their target that it can blot out the nearest star."
