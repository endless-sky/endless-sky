	description `The "Outriders" are a delegation of the Nepetel that perform drastic aftermarket modifications to ships in circulation, allowing ships to perform vastly different roles than they were originally designed for. This upgraded Petelek has lost a gun port and drone bay in preparation for further modifications, but has gained durability, capacity, and a turret mount, allowing it to fulfill a better anti-swarmer role.`

	description `This Outrider Petelek has been extensively modified to improve its performance in a head-to-head combat role. Its weapon capacity rivals some human heavy warships, and the enhanced cooling systems it sports allows it to suppress even the hottest weapons on offer.`
