	description "The Nepetel are fluent in the art of installing multiple weapons inside of a single gun port, and have been doing it for millenia. This large battery contains 3 Kalapats with minimal overhead, owing to the fact that no extra compensation has to be made for differing firing clocks."

	description "Tekelaks are rugged shipboard weapons that the Nepetel have used for roughly a millenium in some form or another. Though their accuracy is poor and delivers lower energy on target than some other weapons, the Tekelak is designed to regenerate a ship's shields while firing, providing sustainability to the ship during combat."

	description "This turret mounts a pair of Tekelaks on a single mount. Though Tekelaks are not the most accurate of weapons, a large volley of Tekelak fire can be a very effective deterrent against fighters thanks to its considerable overall damage output. Additionally, Tekelaks regenerate a ship's shields when firing, meaning a ship equipped with a number of these turrets becomes very difficult to kill without special effort."

	description "The Nepetel have actually redesigned this permutation of the Tekepat combination block many times, slowly squeezing more of the guns together until the overhead is small enough that the entire assembly can fit into a Lilikar drone's gun port. The result is a weapon that delivers remarkable power on target, especially for a drone-mounted gun."

	description `"Tekepat" refers to the combination of a Tekelak Gun and a Kalapat Repeater, which is found in a pair aboard this heavily engineered combo weapon system. The overhead required is quite high, but even one of these blocks is capable of impressive firepower thanks to the 4 independent weapons aboard.`
	description `	An internal capacitor efficiently directs energy where it needs to go, increasing the resource efficiency of the whole system by a small, but noticeable amount.`

	description "For their capital ships, the Nepetel wanted something more than a rearrangement of their existing weapons. The Vikomat works by ionizing and subsequently magnetically accelerating a large chunk of plasma, to devastating effect on target. While the immediate physical damage isn't obvious, one shot causes a debilitating discharging effect, rapidly disbanding a target's shields and ripping energy directly from the subsequently exposed emitters."

	description `The Nepetali word "Pokylateran" comes from several root words that, together, mean "an answer to a problem that didn't exist". This, perhaps, perfectly describes this weapon's supposed function: Firing a missile without firing a missile. The Pokylateran system is a highly engineered, robust method of producing energy based projectiles. After being fired, Pokylateran "missiles" are guided into a favourable attack vector by repulsors aboard the ship, where they then careen unguided toward their target, until they're close enough to physically lock on to their target, at which point they rapidly course correct, smashing into the target.`

	description "While the full-sized implementation of the Pokylateran was a very impressive technical feat and a particularly innovative design for the time, the Nepetel felt it could be improved by miniaturizing it so it could be equipped en masse on Lilikar drones, making a swarm equipped with the weapon remarkably formidable. This version of the weapon is just small enough to squeeze into a Lilikar's gun port, at the cost of reduced shots per burst and vastly increased time between bursts."

	description "The Nepetel don't have any prominent missiles, however this defense system is also very useful for shooting down clusters of debris headed towards the ship.

	"energy consumption" 0.2
	"shield generation" 0.25
	description `The Nepetel do not have particularly potent shipboard generators, so their ships instead employ massive battery complexes to deliver energy where it's needed. Even this "small" complex is larger than most human batteries, capable of storing enough power for most ships to last in combat for quite a long time.`
	description `The complexes do leak some energy overtime, however, the magnetic nature of the storage means that the leaked energy often recharges the shield matrix, so this design "flaw" has persisted for millenium as a desired side effect.`

	description `This Magnetic Power Storage Complex can serve the energy needs of most Nepetel ships very handedly, carrying more energy than any human battery while remaining manageably sized for most applications. The larger complex also comparatively leaks more energy, helping to recharge a ship's shields.`
