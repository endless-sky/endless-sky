	description `Whereas most human designers might spend their whole lives trying to perfect the art of balancing form and function to create ships that appeal to the eye while remaining effective in the field, the Nepetel believe that originality and functionality is the highest form of design. In fact, one of the highest compliments one can give a Nepetel ship designer is "I have no idea which end the front is".`
	description `	The Cenokoj illustrates this custom perfectly: A freighter-carrier, capable of hauling cargo and a small flotilla of drones where they're needed, while also packing enough firepower to keep the craft safe.`

	description `The Cilevikar originated as a design for a space station, but with the success of the Cenokoj, it was reworked to be a station-capital ship hybrid. With its deep reserves of cargo and what seems like a bottomless supply of drones, a Cilevikar can fill the role of a temporary headquarters during the construction of a larger installation. Some Cilevikars are even reworked into stations completely, though these models stop being viable for sale as ships due to mobility being reduced to all but the most basic levels for evading asteroids.`
	description `	Unlike most Nepetel ships, the Cilevikar has a rather robust shield matrix, to the point where some Nepetel engineers have considering using dedicated shield generators to improve the durability of the ships.`

	description `The Nepetel seem to follow strong design model of form over function, and this ship is no exception. Though it may look like it was carved out of junk, the Petelek is a robust carrier warship with potent offensive potential. Like all Netepel ships, the Petelek boasts a potent internal repair system in addition to powerful shipboard coolers, keeping the ship running cold even when fights begin to get out of hand.`

	description `The Nepetel are extremely fond of drone bays, and even their smallest ships reflect this: despite being an interceptor, the Witakul has space for two Lilikar Drones; this, combined with its rather large armament capacity, makes it perfectly suited to being a "wingleader" of sorts, joining in the fray with its own armament while providing anti-missile support.`

	description `The Lilikar, or "Tiny Titan", is the premiere offensive drone offering from the Nepetel. It is rather slow for a drone, but compensates by being able to compete with the fighters of a similarly powerful faction, owing to the fact that all of its weapon space is concentrated around a single, highly-developed gun port, giving it an astonishing capacity for carrying single, high-powered guns, or one of the many combination weapons fielded by the Nepetel.`
	description `	Though some Nepetel engineers argue what remains of the shield matrix could be better replaced with increased armor, most Nepetel ship designers argue that it should remain to take full advantage of the side-effect shield generation of their weapons and energy storage complexes.`
