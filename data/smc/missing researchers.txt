You recognize it as a low-level EMP device. All five holograms turn off, along with all of the computers within 20 meters. Fortunately, your ship is outside that range.`

There, kidnappings are commonplace. In the areas where the victims were taken, there's virtually no evidence. Your navies and intelligence agencies haven't the time to help us; they're busy cleaning up after the war. There is a lot of unfinished business in Syndicate space they don't want to talk about.`

We returned the Hai to their homes, as you did, but they didn't know Republic Intelligence helped them. Several merchants have done the same. About one in seven we rescued were researchers, an extremely disproportionate amount when you consider the number of researchers in human and Hai space. Clearly they're being targeted."`

This is a tradition that goes back long before the era of space travel. Raiding pirate ships is a deadly affair; numerous navy or police will be killed. While it may seem heroic, the casualty rate is unsustainable. The only effective way to discourage piracy is to destroy the ships. If you don't believe me, try catching some yourself and count your dead."`

Worst of all, your authorities have killed numerous Hai on slaver ships, without attempting rescue or even offering surrender. We demand the return of our people and the immediate cease of the killing of slaves."`

The pirates are well-entrenched in their planets, and fighting them is a long and brutal struggle. The war left them stronger than ever with our navies distracted fighting one another."`
			`	The President continues, "The Free Worlds has made great strides reducing piracy by befriending the peoples of the anarchist worlds. We're discussing similar approaches with the Republic. Perhaps in another few years, piracy will be entirely eliminated."`
			`	The Prime Minister says, "We have a counter-proposal. The Free Worlds and Republic will establish a customs service on Allhome. Hai visiting human space will check in with us. Our intelligence agencies will track their movements and see to their safety as best we can; they'll be given contacts on every planet to go to for help. In the meantime, we will place extensive surveillance fleets at Ultima Thule to detect any unapproved Hai travel.

There are two swords on her back and several balanced knives on her belt. She's wearing a bandanna with a medallion on it that looks like an athletic medal.`

			`	You hand your gun to a nearby Unfettered, and hope Teeneep is as capable as she claims.`
			`	Now that you see her in this guise, you remember a fencing match advertisement. She looks exactly like the fencing champion a few years ago.

			`	In one motion, Teeneep spins around, unsheathes a sword, and cuts the man's arm off at the shoulder. While he's writhing in agony, she cleans her sword on his head, and then re-sheathes it.

They're concealed in a subterranean base that can only be reached with a Jump Drive and a Quantum Keystone. Dozens of human capital ships and thousands of human pirates guard the Hai. We haven't enough Jump Drives to rescue them.`

			`	The Hai leader responds, "Your people have outlawed and abandoned us. You give us insulting food donations with propaganda on them. You block our ships from returning to Hai-home. Why should we help you? A race of slothful cowards? Your people are an insult to all Hai." He turns and walks away.`
			`	Teeneep dives beneath the man's legs and jumps on a nearby table in front of him. You had forgotten how quick Hai are; few humans could do what she did. She unsheathes both swords and says, "I challenge you for rule of the Unfettered military!"`
			`	"You haven't the authority to do that," he responds, laughing.`
			`	She jumps down and puts both swords at his throat. "Fight me! Are you afraid to fight a woman half your size? Fight me, coward!" From her expression, you're sure if she genuinely has that much faith in her abilities, or if this is a bluff.`
			`	"There is no need," he smiles. "Even on our planets, I've never met a woman half as brave as you. You are a True Hai and we protect our own. You have vouched for the value of the lives of these Hai, so we will send a fleet to rescue them. I will lead the attack myself."`
