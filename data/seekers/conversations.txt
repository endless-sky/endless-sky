conversation "Seekers First Contact"
    `When you landed on the planet you look around curiosly. The inhabitants are strange people that somehow look like ants but then they do not. You hear no talking between them but some of them are standing in groups and look like they are communicating. After you have observed everything, you get the feeling of being ignored.`
    `    After you waited some time one of them approachs to you. With him he cares an object that has some similarities with a headset. His gestures make it clear that you should wear it on.`
    `    Although you do not know if you can trust them you take it on. As soon as you are fully wearing it there is comming some kind of broken human language out of it.`
    `    "Welcome human, it is not often that someone of your kind reaches my space. I did not know that your technology has growen so far."`
