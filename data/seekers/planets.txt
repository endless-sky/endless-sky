The buildings are not build for human like creatures they have no stairs and go deep underground. Nobody seems to notice you altough a lot of them are "walking" around you. Nobody seems to take a break and all are working. You get the feeling of not fitting in.`
	spaceport `The Spaceport is large and on a high standart. A lot of ships are standing next to you and new ones are coming and going the whole time.`

	landscape land/snow8
	description `This planet is extremly cold so all of the inhabitants are living underground. A beautifull view on white mountains and deep valleys is extending from where you stand. Although you want to look around longer you have to go inside because of the low temperatures.`
	spaceport `The design of the spaceport is only functional there is no sign of stylishness or artistic freedom. The few workers that are out here are all busy and you are not sure if they are even noticing you.`

	landscape land/sea10-sfiera
	description `Water is everywhere. The inhabitants are living on floating islands that are connected by filigrane bridges which do not look very stable. As you step out you notice a strong wind that constantly waves around. Although you do not think that these are good conditions the whole planet is populated.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is an unbeliefable construction standing out of all other buildings. The organic forms make it look like an living organism.`

	landscape land/nasa29
	description `This world is one of the most mysterious things you have ever seen. Somehow the seekers managed to build floating cities in the upper atmosphere of this gas giant. You can breath the air here and a warm wind is comming from the lower layers of the atmosphere. As you look down you see some large lifeforms half bird half fish swimming or flying between the clouds of gas.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is a large floating platform above all other platforms. They use some kind of elevator to move between the spaceport and the other platforms. You wonder how it can hold so many ships but then you remeber that the seekers can manipulate gravity itself.`

	spaceport `Because it would be too hard to land on this planet there is no spaceport but a spacelift. From a small spacestation surrounding the planet incomers can fly down with a special shuttle that can withstand the strond winds.`

	description `This planet is the last outpost of the Seekers. A lot of warships are standing around ready to defense against an attack. Where ever you look there are no civilians but you can see some merchants bringing in supplies.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is gigantic as it has to hold a lot of ships. It is divided into two parts, the larger one for the army and the smaller one for merchants. Most of the merchants are starting directly after they landed and you also dont want to stay here longer than needed.`

	landscape land/dune4
	description `This planet is one large mine. In what direction you look you see large machines digging for ores or other worthfull mineralls. The loud sound of the machines is hurting your ears and think that if there were a local flora or fauna it was killed by the seekers long ago. `
	spaceport `The spaceport is dirty because of the dust that is produced when digging for ores. The most ships are huge freighters ready to delliver the ores to the fabrics on other planets. But there are also some smaller warships standing around here throwing up the question what they are doing here.`
