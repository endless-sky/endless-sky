Since installing weapons would have greatly reduced its cargo capacity, they instead decided to dissuade possible hijackers by developing these Emergency Deployers: they work by activating a series of reactions inside the ship's MHD generator and then ejecting it towards the enemy, resulting in a large scale detonation as soon as it hits something."

	description "The Builders never relied much on shield matrices, preferring instead to strengthen their hull. The reality of war, however, required that the Builders develop strong shield technology, leading to some Het vessels making extensive use of this module."

	"depleted shield delay" 350
	description "This shield generator is the apex of Ka'het shielding technology, a field that developed rapidly and out of necessity rather than gradually and perfected over long periods. Nevertheless, the Grand Restorer grants good protection for the largest Het ships, replacing the basic restorers used elsewhere."
	description "	Unlike most generators, this restorer needs a few seconds to start working again once the ship's shields have been depleted."

	description "The Builders originally created this magnetohydrodynamic generator as the Ka'mar main power source.

	description "The Ka'het engines are peculiar in that they continuously draw large amounts of energy, but require no additional energy to activate: while this means that less power remains available for other subsystems, it is also somewhat more efficient than most types of propulsion, and generates only a tiny amount of heat."

	description "While Ka'het vessels are already equipped with proper engines, most of them use a sustainer engine in addition to give the ship enough maneuverability to be useful in combat. Following the same design as its bigger cousins, the sustainer requires no power to function at the cost of constant energy consumption."

	description "These nacelles used to comprise the entire engine block of a Telis'het. While their size is not impressive compared to other engines, if used in conjunction with a sustainer or two, they can be a powerful form of propulsion, combining both turning and thrusting engines in one."

	description "This tiny engine was developed as the main propulsion of the Ka'mar drones, long before the Ka'het were created and their nacelle design standardized. Improvements over time allowed it to maintain a comparable efficiency to the larger models, although unlike those, it requires some energy to activate the engines in addition to the constant energy drain that all Builder-designed engines have."
