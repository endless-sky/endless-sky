Something feels fundamentally wrong with this ship as you approach a hole in a vulnerable part of its hull, which seems to be some kind of shell encasing a large, slug-like creature. Exposed to weapons fire, the creature seems to be dead, but you feel almost as if something is watching you.`

Something feels fundamentally wrong with this ship, which superficially resembles a Ka'het, yet is clearly not one - perhaps a distant relation, or a Ka'het that has been irrevocably changed by something else. You approach a hole in a vulnerable part of its hull, where a 'het slug appears dead, but you feel almost as if it still watches you.`
