"Well, consider that the Ka'het are true battleships, heavily shielded and always with their weapons ready. These are more akin to reconnaissance and mining probes. Their structure is extremely weak, and they do not have any weapons except the equipment necessary to mine asteroids. I imagine it would take decades for even just a Maeri'het to replicate itself.`

			`	"They do not have any drives on board, not even a hyperdrive. Limited to sub-light velocity, they would need hundreds of years to pass from one system to another, which is a testament to the Builders' patience. Most species we have encountered abandon any form of sub-light transportation between star systems immediately after developing hyperdrive technology. For all we know, the Ember Waste could have been visited by these Fetri'sei or some other Ka'sei, but they had to leave for some reason we are not aware of. The last Builder died almost 100,000 years ago - so long that having a clear idea of what happened is impossible.`
			choice
				`	"What's the difference between Ka'sei and Fetri'sei?"`
			`	"Well, there is no difference," Taely responds, "not in this case at least. The naming scheme the Builders used is a bit odd: we know that 'Ka,' in their language, has a meaning close to the one of 'group,' 'team,' and sometimes even 'ring,' although it can never be used without a name next to it. So we have 'group mar,' 'group het,' and so on. These are not limited to spaceships: the Ka'het, for example, includes both the biological spacecrafts around the Graveyard and the stations that constructs them, while until now we thought that the Ka'sei included only a handful of large scale construction projects. We know 'Fetri' to be a sort of spaceship sub-classification, but we are not aware of its exact meaning. So the Fetri'sei, or 'ship sei' are a part of the Ka'sei, or 'group sei.' To put it simply, it is similar to how all squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares. It just so happens that everything in this system is classified as a Fetri'sei, so we can use either interchangeably.`

However, upon closer examination, there is something consistent about almost every path: once in a while, every ship spends a few minutes on a single asteroid - one of the biggest in the entire asteroid belt.`

"The sensors you carried to Patir had various functions, one of which was a high power asteroid scanner. The asteroid in particular was shown to be extremely rich in a particular metal, iridium. There is more iridium in it than the whole of half a dozen Ember Waste systems, planets included.

Some of the systems at the other end of the Graveyard have seen very few Starlings, most of them staying for less than a day.`

			`	"I need to prepare a few more instruments before we land," Dusk says as he stops staring at the dome and returns to his equipment. As you reach the complex, you do a few flights around it in search for a good landing site. Dusk points out a spot right next to a set of small circular indentations on the structure. After touching down, you and Dusk don extravehicular suits and start walking towards the cupola. He stops in front of a ring on its surface and starts looking through his equipment.`

				`	"What is that?"`
			`	"Well, I obviously cannot be sure, but given its location and that on the other side there is a pressurized area, it should be an airlock. I have seen scans of the Builder stations, and they look quite similar." He takes a heavy-looking scanner, puts it on the wall of the structure and starts moving it around. "If I am right, this way should have a control station hidden inside the wall - and here it is!" he sings with satisfaction.`
			`	Using a small instrument similar in appearance to a crowbar, Dusk slowly pulls out a section from the wall, kicking off a good amount of dust in the process. The control station is a two-sided panel, full of switches and buttons with small alien markings above each of them.`

Soon after, the door in front of you opens, revealing a small room with another door at the opposite end. You follow Dusk inside, where he takes out the scanner again to look for another control panel. Once that is open, another switch allows him to close the door. Only the lights on your helmet keep you from being submerged in complete darkness. Looking around, you notice that the architecture is distinctly alien, with rounded angles on every side of the room and buttresses on either side of the doors. The ring itself is too small for you to pass through it standing upright, but the low gravity of the asteroid lets you almost fly though it without much trouble. "We now have to wait for the room to pressurize," he tells you.`

It should save us some time to do it here, as well as being safer, should it be dangerous to our suits."`

It should save us some time to do it here, as well as also safer, should it be dangerous to our suits."`

			`	Dusk continues working on the atmospheric analyzer for about five minutes without anything happening. You try to connect to the scanner on your ship to check the position of the nearby Fetri'sei, but the dome seems to jam all communication with the outside. Suddenly, you hear a loud "pop," and the door that leads inside the dome recesses a few centimeters. "Just in time," Dusk says. "My analysis of the atmosphere has finished. Let us go take a look inside." After a brief look at the writing on the door, he grabs a handle on it and slides it to the left. The hatch starts to slowly open inwards. When you come closer to the entrance you are instantly blinded by a strong light coming from the other side of the door. After lowering the sun shield on your helmet, your eyes start adapting to the new light level, and it takes you a few seconds to realize what is now in front of you. Landed inside the cupola, right in front of the airlock, is a Fetri'sei - a Ka'sei probe - pointed at you and Dusk.`
			`	Both you and Dusk stand still in front of it without saying a word. Out of the corner of your eye, you can see his hands shivering.

Almost instantly, the Ka'sei starts emitting a loud siren. The ship fires a beam just to the left of you, letting out an ear-piercing wail. Both you and Dusk jump back to the airlock as fast as possible, but you are too far away to reach it in time before a Ravager beam tears through your suit. The last thing you see is Dusk closing the airlock.`

Out of the corner of your eye, you see that there's still air coming out of the airlock, signifying that the interior door has been breached. It is very lucky that your suit has not been punctured.`
			`	Looking around, you see Dusk laying face down next to you. Thankfully, he begins to stand up as you approach him. When he sees you, he silently pauses for a moment, before jerking his head to the airlock and signing. "We need to run.

			`You disembark from your ship with Dusk, discussing the events that occurred in Patir. "Thank you for keeping the Ka'sei alive, <first>. They might be exactly what our Builder research needs, and I really hope I can continue exploring that place with you in the future. I will study what we have gathered in the last days trying to find anything that could give us more clues about them." He waves at you and starts walking towards the exit from the spaceport. "I will contact you again when I find something worth looking at. May the Embers burn bright for you, <first>."`

			`You disembark from your ship with Dusk, who is visible angry that you destroyed one of the Ka'sei. "I told you not to attack them! I told you of their importance!" he signs harshly while pacing back and forth. "Oh my, oh my, we can only hope that this does not close any doors for us. Perhaps we can attempt to communicate with them? Tell them it was an accident?" He looks to you as if searching for some reassurance, but you have none to give. "Forget it. I will study what we have gathered, but I am afraid that it will be all that we will ever gather from that system." Dusk storms off without saying goodbye, typing away on his touchpad as he goes.`
