"Well, keep in mind that the Ka'het are true battleships, heavily shielded and always with their weapons ready. These are more akin to reconnaissance and mining probes. Their structure is extremely weak, and they do not have any weapons except the equipment necessary to mine asteroids. I imagine it would take decades for even just a Maeri'het to replicate itself.`

Limited to sub-light velocity, they would have needed centuries to travel from one system to another, which is a testament to the Builders' patience. Most species we have encountered abandon any form of sub-light transportation between star systems immediately after developing hyperdrive technology. For all we know, it could be the case that the Ember Waste had been visited by these Fetri'sei or some other Ka'sei, but they had to leave for some reason we are not aware of. The last Builder died almost 100,000 years ago - so large a period that having a clear idea of what happened is impossible."`
			choice
				`	"What's the difference between Ka'sei and Fetri'sei?"`
			`	"Well, there is no difference," Taely responds, "not in this case at least. The naming scheme the Builders used is a bit odd: we know that 'Ka', in their language, has a meaning close to 'group' or 'team', and sometimes even 'ring', although it can never be used without a name next to it. So we have 'group mar', 'group het', and so on. This is not limited to spaceships: the term 'Ka'het', for example, includes both the biological spacecrafts around the Graveyard, and the stations that construct them. And until now we thought that the Ka'sei included only a handful of large-scale construction projects. We know 'Fetri' to be a sort of spaceship sub-classification, but we are not aware of its exact meaning. So the Fetri'sei, or 'ship sei' are a part of the Ka'sei, or 'group sei'. To put it simply, it is similar to how all squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares. It just so happens that everything in this system is classified as a Fetri'sei, so we can use both terms interchangeably here.`

As a consequence of that event, we had to reevaluate the procedures for exploring the nearby systems and species, especially beyond the Ossipago wormhole. Every scout ship entering the area has to remain cloaked at all times to avoid hostility from the countless Ka'heta patrolling the area. This means that when systems chosen for scouting are farther away from us, the increased distance requires twice the fuel consumption for ships to be able to return home. This considerably reduces the time we can spend cloaked at the destination; some of the systems at the other end of the Graveyard have seen very few Starlings, most of them staying for less than a day.`

			`	"Because of this, most of the planetary exploration is done using robotic probes. The Ka'het are able to detect and destroy devices that use faster-than-light communication, so a Starling needs to be present in the same system in order to remotely control the probes. There are a lot of compromises that must be made, but we have still managed considerable progress even with these restrictions.`

			`	"I need to prepare a few more instruments before we land," Dusk says as he stops staring at the dome, and returns to his equipment. As you reach the complex, you conduct a few flights around it in search of a good landing site. Dusk points out a spot right next to a set of small circular indentations in the structure. After touching down, you both don extra-vehicular suits and start walking towards the cupola. Dusk stops in front of a ring on its surface, and starts looking through his equipment.`

				`	"What is that?"`
			`	"Well, I obviously cannot be sure, but given its location, and the presence of a pressurized area on the opposite side, this should be an airlock. I have seen scans of the Builder stations, and they look quite similar." He takes a heavy-looking scanner, places it on the wall of the structure, and starts moving it around. "If I am right, there should be a control station hidden inside the wall - and here it is!" he sings with satisfaction.`
			`	Using a small instrument similar in appearance to a crowbar, Dusk slowly pulls out a section from the wall, kicking off a good amount of dust in the process. The control station is a two-sided panel full of switches and buttons, with small alien markings above each of them.`

Soon after, the door in front of you opens, revealing a small room with another door at the opposite end. You follow Dusk inside, where he brings out the scanner again to look for another control panel. Once that is open as well, another switch allows him to close the door. Only the lights on your helmet keep you from being submerged in complete darkness. Looking around, you notice that the architecture is distinctly alien, with rounded angles on every side of the room and buttresses on either side of the doors. The ring itself is too small for you to pass through it standing upright, but the low gravity of the asteroid lets you almost fly though it without much trouble.

It should save us some time to do so here, as well as be safer, should it prove dangerous to our suits."`

It should save us some time to do so here, as well as be safer, should it prove dangerous to our suits."`

			`	Dusk continues working on the gas analyzer for about five minutes. Meanwhile, you try to connect to the scanner on your ship in order to check the positions of the nearby Fetri'sei, but the dome seems to jam all communication with the outside. Suddenly, you hear a loud 'pop!', and the door that leads into the dome recesses a few centimeters. "Just in time," Dusk says. "My analysis of the air in here is finished. Let us go take a look inside." After a brief look at the writing on the door, he grabs a handle on it and slides it to the left. The hatch starts to slowly open inwards. When you come closer to the entrance you are instantly blinded by a strong light coming from the other side of the door. Upon lowering the sun shield on your helmet, your eyes start adapting to the light's intensity, and it takes you a few seconds to realize what is in front of you. Parked inside the cupola, right in front of the airlock, is a Fetri'sei - a Ka'sei probe - facing you and Dusk.`
			`	You're both stood stock-still in front of it without saying a word. Out of the corner of your eye, you can see Dusk's hands shivering.

Almost instantly, the Ka'sei starts emitting a loud siren. The ship fires a beam just to the left of you, letting out an ear-piercing wail. Both you and Dusk try to jump back into the airlock as fast as possible, but you are too far away to reach it in time, and then a Ravager beam tears through your suit. The last thing you see is Dusk closing the airlock.`

Out of the corner of your eye, you see that there's still air coming out of the airlock, indicating that the interior door has been breached as well. You're very lucky that your suit has not been punctured.`

			`You disembark from your ship with Dusk, discussing the events that occurred in Patir. "Thank you for keeping the Ka'sei alive, <first>. They might be exactly what our research on the Builders needs, and I really hope I can continue exploring that system with you in the future. I will study what we have gathered in the past few days, and try to find anything that could give us more clues about them." He waves at you and starts walking towards the exit from the spaceport. "I will contact you again when I find something worth looking at. May the Embers burn bright for you, <first>."`

			`You disembark from your ship with Dusk, who is visibly angry that you destroyed one of the Ka'sei. "I told you not to attack them! I told you of their importance!" he signs harshly while pacing back and forth. "Oh my, oh my, we can only hope that this does not close any doors for us. Perhaps we can attempt to communicate with them? Tell them it was an accident?" He looks to you as if searching for some reassurance, but you have none to give. "Forget it. I will study what we have gathered, but I am afraid that this will be all that we will ever gather from that system." Dusk storms off without saying goodbye, typing away on his touchpad as he goes.`
