In the following pictures, presumably depicting different iterations of the same ship, the structure becomes gradually bigger and more complex until the last one, where a Ka'het-like slug is shown growing inside this shell.`
			`	"The ships, the Fetri'sei, are Von Neumann probes," she says. "Self replicating spacecraft. Unlike the Ka'het, which we found to be unable to reproduce and can only be created in a factory, the Ka'sei can duplicate their own structure with the material harvested from the local asteroids. The process probably takes years, or more, but it is still an incredible achievement."`

			`	Taely looks towards the console again. On the screen a tactical view of the Fetri'sei appears. "Well, consider that the Ka'het are true battleships, heavily shielded and always with their weapons ready. These are more akin to reconnaissance and mining probes. Their structure is extremely weak, and they do not have any weapons except the equipment necessary to mine asteroids. I imagine it would take decades for even just a Maeri'het to replicate itself.`
			`	"There is also the tactical problem: forcing a Ka'het to spend such a long time building copies of itself makes them vulnerable to enemy attacks and unable to effectively fight back, making them ill-suited for the job."`
				goto questions
			label "jump drive"
			`	"They do not have any drives on board, not even a hyperdrive. Limited to sub-light velocity, they would need hundreds of years to pass from one system to another, which is a testament to the Builders' patience. Most species we have encountered abandon any form of sub-light transportation between star systems immediately after developing hyperdrive technology. For all we know, the Ember Waste could have been visited by these Fetri'sei or some other Ka'sei, but they had to leave for some reason we are not aware of. The last Builder died almost 100,000 years ago - so long that having a clear idea of what happened is impossible."`
			choice
				`	"What's the difference between Ka'sei and Fetri'sei?"`
			`	"Well, there is no difference," Taely responds, "not in this case at least. The naming scheme the Builders used is a bit odd: we know that 'Ka,' in their language, has a meaning close to the one of 'group,' 'team,' and sometimes even 'ring,' although it can never be used without a name next to it. So we have 'group mar,' 'group het,' and so on. These are not limited to spaceships: the Ka'het, for example, includes both the biological spacecrafts around the Graveyard and the stations that constructs them, while until now we thought that the Ka'sei included only a handful of large scale construction projects. We know 'Fetri' to be a sort of spaceship sub-classification, but we are not aware of its exact meaning. So the Fetri'sei, or 'ship sei' are a part of the Ka'sei, or 'group sei.' To put it simply, it is similar to how all squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares. It just so happens that everything in this system is classified as a Fetri'sei, so we can use either interchangeably.`

However, upon closer examination, there is something consistent about almost every path: once in a while, every ship spends a few minutes on a single asteroid - one of the biggest in the entire asteroid belt.`

"The sensors you carried to Patir had various functions, one of which was a high power asteroid scanner. The asteroid in particular was shown to be extremely rich in a particular metal, iridium. There is more iridium in it than the whole of half a dozen Ember Waste systems, planets included.

Some of the systems at the other end of the Graveyard have seen very few Starlings, most of them staying for less than a day.`

			`	"I need to prepare a few more instruments before we land," Dusk says as he stops staring at the dome and returns to his equipment. As you reach the complex, you do a few flights around it in search for a good landing site. Dusk points out a spot right next to a set of small circular indentations on the structure. After touching down, you and Dusk don extravehicular suits and start walking towards the cupola. He stops in front of a ring on its surface and starts looking through his equipment.`

"If I am right, this way should have a control station hidden inside the wall - and here it is!" he sings with satisfaction.`

Soon after, the door in front of you opens, revealing a small room with another door at the opposite end. You follow Dusk inside, where he takes out the scanner again to look for another control panel. Once that is open, another switch allows him to close the door. Only the lights on your helmet keep you from being submerged in complete darkness. Looking around, you notice that the architecture is distinctly alien, with rounded angles on every side of the room and buttresses on either side of the doors. The ring itself is too small for you to pass through it standing upright, but the low gravity of the asteroid lets you almost fly through it without much trouble.

It should save us some time to do it here, as well as being safer, should it be dangerous to our suits."`

It should save us some time to do it here, as well as also safer, should it be dangerous to our suits."`

			`	Dusk continues working on the atmospheric analyzer for about five minutes without anything happening. You try to connect to the scanner on your ship to check the position of the nearby Fetri'sei, but the dome seems to jam all communication with the outside. Suddenly, you hear a loud "pop," and the door that leads inside the dome recesses a few centimeters. "Just in time," Dusk says. "My analysis of the atmosphere has finished. Let us go take a look inside." After a brief look at the writing on the door, he grabs a handle on it and slides it to the left. The hatch starts to slowly open inwards. When you come closer to the entrance you are instantly blinded by a strong light coming from the other side of the door. After lowering the sun shield on your helmet, your eyes start adapting to the new light level, and it takes you a few seconds to realize what is now in front of you. Landed inside the cupola, right in front of the airlock, is a Fetri'sei - a Ka'sei probe - pointed at you and Dusk.`
			`	Both you and Dusk stand still in front of it without saying a word. Out of the corner of your eye, you can see his hands shivering.

Almost instantly, the Ka'sei starts emitting a loud siren. The ship fires a beam just to the left of you, letting out an ear-piercing wail. Both you and Dusk jump back to the airlock as fast as possible, but you are too far away to reach it in time before a Ravager beam tears through your suit. The last thing you see is Dusk closing the airlock.`

We hope to find the answer soon enough.`

			`As you slowly descend toward the surface of the planetoid, most of the Fetri'sei continue to orbit Patir, going in and out of the asteroid belt to mine precious metals from it. The few around the planetoid travel not towards the ruins of the Builder settlement, but rather to the massive stockpile of iridium situated nearby. After a final pass around the dome to ensure none of them have begun following you, you land near the imprint your spaceship left in the dusty regolith the last time you came here.`
			`	"Great work, Captain. We are ready to start our mission." Dusk and his team are carrying with them a set of instruments similar to the first time you were here, from compact laser scanners to a pair of large crowbars. On the crew's backs are cylinders of varying dimensions, with the largest being almost a meter wide. You follow them through the ship's airlock onto the surface and begin the walk towards the complex. Halfway to the dome, Dusk speaks over the radio. "<first>, before we arrive there, do you have any further questions on the mission plan?"`

			`	"Well, I really hope so!" Dusk replies, grinning behind the glass of his helmet.`
				goto entrance

			label inside
			`	"Well, that is up to you. From the brief scans I made of the structure it does not seem to have particularly thick internal walls, so communication between us within the dome should be feasible. You could come with me inside the structure to help identify what we find, or if you prefer you could also remain near the airlocks and keep an eye out for incoming Fetri'sei. As I said, the choice is yours."`
				goto entrance

			label dusk
			`	"It depends. Here, look," he says, passing you a data pad with a rather blurry picture. "It is a still image taken from the recording of our encounter with the Fetri'sei. The strong lights ruined most of the video, so we will to have to settle for this picture, but look at the background: do you see that curved board on the left? The quality of the video is too low to be sure, but I think it could be a map of the complex. If I am right, we could split into groups and cover more ground in the few hours we are going to spend here."`
				goto entrance

			label kasei
			`	"Honestly? At this point, I am positive they will. The last time we came here, they had already found us and were probably starting to enter the dome. Right now, they are still in the asteroid belt continuing their mission. There's the possibility that the airlock will alert them of our arrival, but at this point it is unlikely. In either case, I will be sure to keep an eye on the airlock once we are inside the dome."`
			label entrance
			`	It doesn't take long to reach the airlock ring in front of the dome. The airlock you used last time is still open, and its control panel is visible next to it. Dusk, following your gaze, quickly stops you. "I doubt it would be a good idea to pass through the same airlock we used last time, <first>," he says. "It looks like the structure's automated systems patched up the hole left by the Ka'sei, but I would never trust it as a pressure vessel at this point. Plus, I count at least six more airlocks we could use."`
			`	He and another member of the group move to the opposite side of the control station next to the airlock, then flip one of the switches on the panel. Just like last time, a door opens next to them, revealing another on the opposite side of the small room. There is space only for three crew members at a time; you, Dusk, and another Remnant enter the airlock, while the other three wait their turn. The door closes, and Dusk flips the switch to begin the pressurization procedure. Suddenly, the lights inside the module turn on, emitting a bright, azure light.`
			choice
				`	"Did you do that?"`
				`	"What happened?"`
			`	"I am not sure. Wait." Moving to the opposite side of the airlock, he uses a crowbar to open another hidden control station, which slides out of the wall to reveal a rather large screen scrolling through some alien writing. After reading through it with some difficulty, Dusk breathes a sigh of relief and pulls it back to its original location. "I think it is nothing," he adds, "at least I hope so. From what I could gather, the lights being switched on were a normal, timed event in the commanded startup sequence - why they did not turn on last time is beyond me, but nothing seems to be out of the ordinary. Perhaps they were just broken."`
			`	A few minutes later, pressurization finishes, and the interior door opens. You follow Dusk out of the airlock and find yourself in front of a large area, likely the same place the encounter with the Fetri'sei took place. "The moment of truth," exclaims Dusk, placing down a heavy scanner, similar to a short telescope. "This is a low-power laser system, capable of measuring the density of the atmosphere anywhere within 10 kilometers. If a Fetri'sei was alerted when we crossed the airlock, by now the large airlock will be filling up with oxygen and argon to allow it to pass through, and this sensor here will register it. Let's see." A tense silence ensues as the machine boots up.`
			choice
				`	"What does it say?"`
				`	"What are the readings?"`
			`	Dusk smiles. "The airlock is still empty. It looks like we can finally begin exploring the facility." When the rest of the group finishes crossing the airlock, you all start moving toward a curved board, placed equidistant from each of the entrances. After scrutinizing the writings on it for a few seconds, one of the Remnant exclaims, "A map!" Dusk starts discussing something with the rest of his team, but from your position you can't see what they're signing.`
			choice
				`	(Wait for them to finish their discussion.)`
				`	(Move closer to try to follow the conversation.)`
				`	(Try to get Dusk's attention.)`
			`	Dusk turns around to you. "So, <first>," he asks, "what do you think? This is indeed a map of the Builder complex. The team and I have split the exploration in four groups - one going to the armory, one visiting the underground facilities and another visiting someplace that roughly translates to 'part cycler.' If you want to come with me, we can choose between the general storage area and what seem to be some kind of elevated gardens. Or you could remain here to keep an eye on the laser scanner if you wish; the choice is yours."`
			choice
				`	"Let's go to the storage."`
					goto storage
				`	"I think it is best to visit the elevated gardens."`
					goto gardens
				`	"Sorry, but the Ka'sei are too much of a danger. I will stay here."`
			`	"Alright." Dusk and the rest of the team split toward different buildings in the complex, disappearing behind large armored doors. The next hours pass slowly as you stand outside the complex, surrounded by complete silence interrupted only by short updates from those exploring the buildings. Almost four hours later, while checking the atmospheric density scanner yet again, you notice a blinking yellow light, placed near the bottom of the control panel.`
			choice
				`	(Call Dusk with the radio.)`
					goto alarm
				`	(Ignore it.)`
			`	As the time passes, the light dims and blinks slower. It takes almost half an hour, but the yellow light finally turns off entirely.`
			`	Some time later the group returns, satisfied with what they've found inside. "It was an interesting trip for sure, Captain," Dusk tells you. "Did anything of note happen out here?"`
			choice
				`	(Tell him about the light.)`
					goto explain
				`	"Not much. It was a bit boring."`
			`	"I imagine so. You would have been more helpful in the complex together with me." After picking up the scanners, you begin to pass through the airlocks, three people at a time. After a few minutes, you're all back outside the dome, ready to finally return to <planet>.`
				goto ending

			label alarm
			`	As you tell him about the blinking light, he interrupts you and announces to the rest of the group that they are leaving. "The yellow light is an indicator that the battery is running out," he explains hurriedly. "I should have checked our equipment better. Soon, the starship airlock will be unwatched." Instead of going through a single airlock, the group splits, half going into one airlock and half into another. When you're finally all outside of the dome, the tense mood dissipates.`
				goto ending

			label explain
			`	As you tell him about the blinking light, his expression changes. "You should have called me! We could have died!" He moves to the console on the laser scanner, which stays dark. "The yellow light was an indicator that the battery was running out," he says. "I should have checked our equipment better. The starship airlock may have remained unwatched for hours now. We need to leave." Instead of going through a single airlock, the group splits, half going into one airlock and half into another. When you're finally all outside of the dome, the tense mood dissipates.`

			label ending
			`	While walking back to the ship, Dusk continues talking about the mission. He explains that they found that the Patir settlement had never been visited in its history - not even by the Builders themselves. "I did not expect to find a thriving colony inside, but this is perplexing. A possible theory is that the settlement was built by the Ka'sei themselves, but the variety of designs inside and the way everything was assembled contradicts everything we know about their capabilities. Perhaps the buildings were transported here together with them - or perhaps even the entire asteroid was brought here from a Graveyard system, though that seems unlikely. There is a lot we still have to learn about Patir."`
			`	Once you're back inside the <ship>, the team moves to their rooms to continue discussing theories about the Builder settlement here. Next destination: <planet>.`
				accept

			label storage
			`	Dusk takes the lead, and you reach a large building on the opposite side of the dome. The towering cubical structure has multiple doors on the sides, each of them taller than the one before; its walls are light, of a pale blue, with gold and brown finishes around the signs scattered across the area. Dusk stops in front of one of the smallest doors, only a few centimeters taller than you, and starts pushing it to the side to make it slide. Slowly but surely, it starts to move. Dusk enters first, and you follow.`
			`	If the depot seemed large from the outside, it's even more impressive seen from the inside; massive, sturdy shelves tower left and right, surrounded by odd machinery and cylindrical containers. While you're still studying the structure, Dusk calls you over. "Look here, <first>," he says, indicating the lower shelves in front of him. "What do you see?" It isn't easy to inspect the shelves with just your helmet lights, but you notice they're all empty. "This is not what I would expect from a settlement that used to be inhabited."`
			choice
				`	"What do you think happened here?"`
					goto theory
				`	"Maybe the rest of the depot will have something."`
					goto samples
				`	"Is it possible that they just emptied the storage when they left?"`
			`	"Maybe. But look at how pristine this place is. There is no dirt or dust anywhere I can see, and everything seems to be exactly where it should. It seems more as if it was never inhabited in the first place. There are far too many unknowns about Patir and this settlement to be certain of anything, though." He pulls another instrument from a waist pouch, then begins gathering samples from around the depot, both from the ground and on the shelves. The procedure takes a few minutes; he then puts the samples in one of the cylinders on his back and starts moving to the next room, signing for you to follow him.`
				goto depot

			`	"At first I thought they abandoned this place and took everything with them, but look: there is no dirt or dust anywhere I can see, and everything seems to be exactly where it should.

He pulls another instrument from a waist pouch, then begins gathering samples from around the depot, both from the ground and on the shelves.

				goto depot

			`	"Maybe, but I would not get my hopes up if I were you." Sitting down, Dusk takes out of his waist pouch a slim, organic-looking instrument, connected with a cable to a larger box still inside the bag. He takes samples from everywhere in the room: the shelves, the door, the walls, even some from the floor. After enclosing everything inside cylindrical containers, he tells you to get ready to move to another compartment.`
			label depot
			`	You follow Dusk around the building, but the results are the same. The depot is full of empty, untouched containers and barren racks in an incredible state of preservation. After Dusk gathers the last samples, you follow him outside, where you join the other teams leaving the building with their samples. Next stop: <planet>.`

			`	"I agree, it feels the more interesting of the two." The two of you follow the route indicated on the map for a while before reaching the entrance: a slender, sturdy-looking pillar roughly two meters wide with a circular opening on one side. Moving closer you can see the end of a shallow ramp right beyond the door, swirling upwards inside of the column and likely reaching the top of the dome.`
			`	"If this is supposed to be the exit of the garden," Dusk says, "I fail to see where the entrance should be. We are going to have to walk up it instead."`
			choice
				`	"Alright, let's go."`
					goto ramp
				`	"I would rather keep searching for the entrance."`
			`	You and Dusk keep walking around the structure for almost half an hour to no avail; with no other choices left but going up the ramp, you give up and decide to follow it up the pillar. Going through it is simpler than it looked, as the surface of the floor is ribbed in a peculiar way so that gripping onto it becomes rather effortless. Despite this, it takes half an hour to reach the garden, and the roof of the dome still lies well above.`
				goto top

			label ramp
			`	You follow Dusk up along the ramp, the length of it making the ascent quite tiresome. Luckily, going through it is simple, as the surface of the floor is ribbed in a peculiar way so that gripping onto it becomes rather effortless. Even so, though the garden is nowhere near the top of the dome, it takes another half an hour to reach it.`
			label top
			`	The view at the top is disappointing. In front of you, there are only rows upon rows of long racks with a dry, light gray material on the top and bottom of each shelf. Interspersed between the rows there is some Builder equipment, in which you only recognize large unlit lamps connected to the rest of the structure. Despite all of this, there are no plants anywhere, as far as the eye can see. "I believe we have stumbled upon some kind of hydroponics facility," Dusk says. "I think I have mistranslated the label on the map; this is more like a field than a simple garden."`
			choice
				`	"What is the plan now?"`
					goto plan
				`	"Why are there no plants growing?"`
			`	"It has probably been around a hundred thousand years since the last time a sapient being was anywhere near this structure. If we were on an Earth-like planet, the plants would have completely covered any artificial structure, but here on an asteroid in the middle of nowhere? Whatever water supply this place had likely ran out when the Builders were still alive." After stopping to think for a few seconds, Dusk continues.`
			label plan
			`	"Even if there are no plants, there must be containers with seeds and fertilizers somewhere around here. We have already wasted a lot of time coming up here; if you go look for those while I gather samples from the abandoned hydroponics, we will cover more terrain in the time we have left." As Dusk begins to prepare the sampling vials and the rest of the equipment, you walk toward the back of the "fields." You enter a series of tall rooms parallel to the hydroponics, none of which contain anything of note - all except the last room, which contains numerous hexagonal containers stacked on top of each other.`
			choice
				`	(Call Dusk.)`
					goto call
				`	(Open one of the boxes.)`
			`	You take one of the boxes from the top of the stack. It seems very heavy for its size, but with the help of the almost negligible gravity of the asteroid, you eventually succeed in taking it down to the floor. Opening it is even harder, as the box seems to have been sealed shut hermetically. After a lot of struggle, it opens to reveal a mass of spherical, light blue seeds tightly packed together.`
			`	Dusk reaches you shortly thereafter, but he doesn't seem too happy. "I have few pressurized containers with me, <first>. We cannot expose the seeds to the vacuum of space without the risk of killing them, and we are going to need as many chances as possible to make something grow." Taking another box from the stack, he continues, "We ought to leave this one here for a future expedition and grab another one instead."`
				goto continue

			label call
			`	It doesn't take long for Dusk to reach you. "Great find, <first>." After glancing at boxes on various piles, he finally settles for one on the top of a nearby stack and brings it down. "From the labels on its back, it seems to contain three different kinds of seeds."`
			label continue
			`	As you awkwardly scoot down the slide with the seeds, the same corrugated texture that made it possible to climb now working against you, Dusk continues his explanation. "It seems odd how none of the boxes you found were empty, or even unsealed. The hydroponics fields were in a similar situation; you would expect to find at least traces indicating the place used to be full of plants, but there was nothing of that sort. I am starting to believe this place was never inhabited in the first place, but assembling this facility would go far beyond the known capabilities of the Ka'sei."`
			`	Shortly after reaching the end, you meet up with the rest of the team, who all describe situations similar to the one you found. It takes a while to reach your ship outside the dome, but finally everything is ready to return to Remnant space. Next stop: <planet>.`

With the cargo ramp pointed toward the entrance and the post-flight checklist completed, the Remnant team begins to deploy the lab while you remain in the cockpit, keeping an eye on Ka'sei activity. The researchers work quickly and nearly without issue in the light gravity of the asteroid, besides the occasional lost screw. However, the construction job still takes nearly the entire day.`
			`	With the Ka'sei still oblivious, and the lab set up, you take advantage of the opportunity to stretch your legs and pay a visit to the researchers in the new outpost. "So, Captain," asks Dusk, meeting you at the entrance, "what do you think of it?"`

			`	You step inside the lab's internal door, removing your helmet now that the atmosphere is breathable. Dusk takes you around the cylindrical hub to show the various sections of it: the sleeping quarters, small but not cramped; the extravehicular research module, a flexible corridor connecting it with the airlock and housing spacesuits with rather unwieldy instruments, and so on. As the tour comes to an end, you and Dusk return to the entrance, where the rest of the team is split between checking the expedition's equipment and preparing something to eat.

				goto decline

			label dinner
			`	Lacking a true dining room, the meal has been set up on a table between the bunks of the researchers. It takes a few tries to find a position in which everyone is at least somewhat comfortable and the dinner can finally begin. You notice that the portions of the rather unappealing Remnant food are much smaller than what you're used to seeing them eat - similar to yours, in fact. One of the researchers notices you looking at her plate, and replies, "I assume you have been told about the symbionts and their increased nutritional needs by now? The four of us have been selected for the mission in part because of the fact that we are part of the small number of scientists that do not wear one, which makes us better suited for expeditions with limited supplies."`

Being the lead researcher of this mission, there was not much choice left; removing it at this point wasn't an acceptable option, and switching positions this late into the program would have been much more harmful than increasing the reserves planned to the right level." As the dinner comes to an end, you and Dusk move back near the entrance.`
				goto next

			label reason
			`	"For me, the reason is medical. My body rejected the symbiont quite violently shortly after the initial operation, to the point that even attempting to install another would be very risky. But if you ask around, the causes are quite varied." As the dinner comes to an end, you and Dusk move back near the entrance.`

Do not go too far in the meanwhile, though - emergencies can always happen, and you are supposed to be our ride back when the time comes." He pauses for a few seconds to think. "If you are interested, perhaps you could remain here with us to help with the research. You would need to sleep in your starship, of course, and the supplies would be slightly more limited, but neither issue is a showstopper. It is up to you, <first>."`

You move back aboard your ship and walk up to the bunks to prepare for the night; however, you notice out of a window that the full Remnant team has come out of the lab, staring up at the sky. You attempt to contact them, but the only result is an eerie quiet. All of a sudden, you realize what is wrong: the starry night is gone, and a sky of an overwhelming black now surrounds everything and everyone.`

For a split second you think that they've come outside to watch the liftoff, but they aren't looking at your ship; they're staring up, at the sky. You attempt to contact them, but the only result is an eerie quiet. All of a sudden, you realize what is wrong: the starry night is gone, and a sky of an overwhelming black now surrounds everything and everyone.`
			label sky
			`	As your eyes adapt to a featureless sky, you notice brief, nearly imperceptible white streaks passing past your field of view in an instant. The lines become more and more visible, almost like stars during a hyperjump, when your attention is captured by a white mass slightly above the horizon. It starts as a tiny dot in the distance, then becomes bigger and bigger, until it covers the entire sky. The extreme light it produces forces you to look away for a second, and when you look back, there are even more streaks in the sky, to the point of making you feel nauseous.`
			`	You can't tell how much time has passed since the phenomenon began, but it finally starts to show signs that it's coming to an end: the streaks become shorter and last longer in the sky, and the number of stars you can see becomes less and less. You begin noticing more and more details; some streaks seem to end before reaching the horizon, while others follow a curved or even cyclical pattern around Patir. Eventually, the stars come to a standstill, and everything returns to normal.`
			`	Still dizzy from the experience, you carefully walk back down outside to speak with the Remnant. By the time you've reached them, they seem to have recomposed themselves and have started studying some sort of holographic stellar map.`

"In order to access this module, we are about to melt through its hull," Dusk announces. "Are you ready?"`
			choice
				`	"Of course."`
					goto melting
				`	"Are you sure this is safe?"`
			`	"As far as we can tell. The module is fully depressurized, and it seems to be completely inert from our scans - there are always uncertainties, of course, but this is the most easily accessible spot we could identify in the little time we had."`
			label melting
			`	A bright flash begins the boarding operations; one of the Remnant, handling the same torch you had seen earlier, slowly cuts a roughly circular hole into the module's whipple shield until it comes off handily. Moving the debris away, the process is then soon repeated with the next layer and again with one right after; the strong vibrations it imparts into the rest of the structure give you a clear hint about the power of this device. Eventually, the innermost layer is removed as well, and you follow the rest of the team inside the alien platform.`
			`	Disconnecting from the tether to move further into the opening, you immediately notice the module seems to have some peculiarities. Despite the microgravity in it, no handrails can be found near you, making movement very difficult; as you search for some inside with your flashlight, however, your attention is caught by something more bizarre: an ominous, featureless blob, hovering midair a few meters away from you.`
			`	The object's surface, only interrupted by a few cyclical ripples, reflects and eerily distorts everything around the room. A complete silence has fallen over the room, as everyone seems to evaluate the situation. After a few seconds, Dusk and two Remnant start moving toward the phenomenon carrying a device in their hands.`
			choice
				`	"What is that thing?"`
					goto thing
				`	(Wait and see what happens.)`
					goto thing
				`	(Raise my blaster.)`
			`	Noticing your reaction, Dusk gestures you to stop. "Calm down, Captain," he signs, "a handgun would be of little use in this situation." Keeping an eye on the data the other scientists are gathering, he continues. "We seem to have entered the station from one of the fuel tanks. That sphere over there is made of some kind of propellant, though our instruments have some difficulties determining its exact composition.`
				goto continue

			label thing
			`	"Interesting," Dusk states, as if immersed in his thoughts. After checking that the device has started gathering data, he continues. "We seem to have entered the station from one of the fuel tanks. That sphere over there is made of some kind of propellant, though our instruments have some difficulties determining its exact composition. It must have an incredibly low vapor pressure to remain liquid in this near vacuum.`
			label continue
			`	"All I can say for certain is that it is not the hyperdrive fuel we use - liquid deuterium would have boiled off long ago. Luckily, we don't need to know what it is; there should be enough space to pass through without touching it." Scouting around the tank for a passage, the team quickly identifies a maintenance hatch, hopefully leading to the crew section, and starts creating another hole to pass through. The whole process is slightly quicker than the first was, but by the time they're done more than a third of the oxygen reserves in your suit are gone.`
			`	Moving through the opening, you reach a long, cylindrical corridor, just as dark as the room you just came from. Based on the many handles and scaffolding attached to the surfaces around you, you guess this part of the station used to be inhabited. After following the group through the tunnel for a few minutes, you reach an intersection: the corridor splits into two lateral openings, each of them seemingly as small and endless as the one you're in.`
			`	"We only have a limited amount of time for this expedition, <first>. You have seen us work a few times now; can you explore the two tunnels on your own and reach us when you have completed it?" Dusk asks. "We will remain in radio contact the entire time."`
			choice
				`	(Accept.)`
					goto tunnel
				`	"Do you have any information about this section?"`
				`	"Why are you not going to help explore these tunnels?"`
					goto help
			`	"Not much. We only had time for a brief scan during the approach, but based on the volume of these sectors alone, it shouldn't take you more than a couple hours to explore them.`
				goto tunnel
			label help
			`	"Well, we have our own tunnels to go through," he replies half-seriously. "We have a lot of ground to cover, and only so much air in our suits. The safest way to increase our reach without staying here for weeks is by splitting up, like we did when we first explored the Builder settlement a few weeks ago.`
			label tunnel
			`	"Whenever you reach a new area, take samples and pictures of anything you deem interesting. Never forget to keep an eye on your oxygen: each of us will consume it at slightly different rates, and we should start the trip back as soon as someone has less than a third of a tank left. May the Embers help your search, Captain, and see you soon!"`
			`	Moving in the zero gravity station is quick and relatively easy; despite its length, it only takes you a few minutes to reach the end of the right tunnel. All you can find, however, is a closed hatch. A few tries at forcing it open only serve to confirm that it is locked shut, and you decide to go back and try the other tunnel. This time, your search turns up results, and you end up in a dark, somewhat cramped room.`
			`	The room is lavish and dazzling, the walls covered with intricate carvings. It's a striking difference from the gray and slightly coarse material everywhere else in the station, pushing you to gather a few samples to analyze later. To an extent, it reminds you of the Art Deco paintings of ancient humanity. Around the room, alien plants of varying height and shape paint every corner with a reddish hue.`
			choice
				`	(Quickly take a sample and move on with my mission.)`
					goto moving
				`	(Leave them alone.)`
					goto moving
				`	(Inspect them closer.)`
			`	Growing from the vase up to almost the ceiling, the plant you choose to analyze stands at nearly twice your height; despite this, the trunk is only a few millimeters thick, thanks to the lack of gravity aboard the station. Slender, needle-like leaves are spread across the entire stem, contrasting its okra with a red tint.`
			`	As you try to take a better look at the fronds, the entire trunk breaks in half with minimal pressure. You try to pick up the upper segment before it flies away, but this only splits it into more parts; you decide to observe the resulting pieces from afar instead. To your surprise, the plant is completely hollow, with a large hole inside the stem. You take a few pictures and a couple samples of both the surface and of the vase, then move to the next room.`
			label moving
			`	The rest of the zone isn't as interesting. A series of holes in a wall attract your attention, but they prove too narrow to pass through and too long to see the end; similarly, the corridor at the end of the area is slightly smaller than your suit, preventing you from continuing. As you return back to the rest of the group, however, you notice an unusual drawing.`
			`	The canvas, attached between various carvings, shows a series of points in a line with every color of the rainbow. While the lines are near the bottom of the mural, above them all shines what looks like a red sun, sending rays of light down to each of the colorful dots and surrounding them all in a crimson halo. You pass your glove over its surface, and you notice every part is composed of a different material, smoother and more refined than the walls around it.`
			`	While the oxygen levels in your suit continue to lower, you follow Dusk's instructions from the radio up and down the maze of tunnels until reaching a large open area where you finally find the Remnant, busy observing a vial of samples. Behind them, you see the start of the giant barrel that composes most of the station's structure.`
			choice
				`	"What is this place?"`
					goto place
				`	"What is inside the vial?"`
					goto vial
				`	(Move closer to the barrel.)`
			`	The sheer size of the frame is rather impressive: as you walk toward it, you estimate it must be at least a kilometer from one side to the opposite. At the very end, an enormous lens is attached to the last ring of the barrel; four holes near its center give it a slight resemblance to a cloth button.`
			label place
			`	"We are most likely in the exhaust chamber of this station's laser system," Dusk says, putting the vial inside a container. "It is impossible to say for certain what its purpose was - hopefully, it was not purely a military system. That being said, we have obtained some info that is far more relevant for our search. Let us get going toward the <ship> first, then I will show you everything we have gathered."`
				goto back

			label vial
			`	"Our ticket back, hopefully," Dusk replies with a half smile. "While everything we have seen is interesting in its own way, there is something in particular that gives me hope about finding a way out. But first, we need to start moving back now - we have spent enough time studying this exhaust chamber, and our oxygen margins are starting to worry me."`
			label back
			`	One at a time, the group enters back into the main tunnel, with Dusk at the rear and you right in front of him. You notice the passage at the end doesn't show any blowtorch marks; it seems that the Remnant found it already open when they arrived here.`
			`	"While you were exploring that sector, we found a few more tunnels and split up into subgroups to explore each of them. This is how we found the path to the barrel, for instance, as well as many other peculiar areas. And, in one of them," he continues, clumsily passing you a data pad, "this is what we stumbled upon."`
			`	Looking at the screen, you see a photograph of two Remnant standing in front of a large mural, three times as tall as them and far wider. Despite the picture being rather poorly lit, you recognize it as a two-dimensional starmap, carved into the wall of the station. Near the bottom right, a set of circles and unfamiliar markers surround one of the systems indicated.`
			`	"Look at the orbital parameters of that system. It is, without a shadow of doubt, indicating Patir. A system they should not be aware of, if it only just arrived here, but it is one they were apparently interested in."`
			choice
				`	"It could be a coincidence."`
					goto coincidence
				`	"Perhaps Patir used to stay here before reaching the Milky Way."`
					goto milky
				`	"For what purpose?"`
			`	"I would also like to know that. I cannot recognize the language in the text, and deciphering it would be an enormous task - one that would require a vast amount of text to analyze, as well as years of focused effort from the whole community. We must base our decisions only on what we can infer from the graphic itself, which is far from ideal. And then, there is this."`
				goto crystal
			label milky
			`	"You may be right. I cannot recognize the language in the text, and deciphering it would be an enormous task - one that would require a vast amount of text to analyze, as well as years of focused effort from the whole community. We must base our decisions only on what we can infer from the graphic itself, which is far from ideal. And then, there is this."`
				goto crystal
			label coincidence
			`	"Maybe. Without reading the text surrounding it, which is written neither in Builder nor any language I can recognize, we can only analyze what we can infer from the graphic itself - something far from ideal. But if we take it at face value, it could be the first step towards escape from this sector. And then, there is this."`
			label crystal
			`	Dusk hands you the vial from earlier, which, despite its size, feels rather heavy in your hand. Inside is a grainy dust interspersed with small, violet crystals of various shapes. "We found a similar powder on the ground of a number of rooms inside the station. We have not explored the entire complex, of course, but if the pattern repeats we expect there to be something similar around the entire barrel."`
			`	The particles suspended in the vial remind you of the regolith surrounding the Builder settlement orbiting Patir, but far less compact. "Attempts to learn the dust's composition have been inconclusive. Perhaps the instruments in the lab will give us better results, but our current tools only returned noise. However, we did notice something potentially interesting: the noise aligned with the scans you took in Lathia a few days ago. Whatever it is, it could be made of the same matter that composes those creatures - I can use the scanners on your ship to confirm it without wasting any time while we depart."`
			`	You exit the station and enter your ship, and see most of the scientists have already moved their samples inside your cargo hold, with around two dozen containers scattered on the floor. Soon after, you're back inside the cockpit, preparing for liftoff; discussion about the next mission will have to wait until you're in Patir.`

			`Dusk seems busier than usual as you descend towards the settlement, constantly communicating with the team on the ground while simultaneously checking the incoming telemetry. When you're hovering right above the landing pad, he turns to your console. "Keep the thrusters in standby, Captain," he signs hastily. "We are not here to stay. The satellites are working very well; in fact, the Thepa probe has just detected one of those beings jumping right in our direction. We have only a few hours to return to orbit, or we will waste this opportunity."`
			`	On the ground, the whole team rushes out of your ship toward the lab, soon returning with their hands full of strange equipment and unwieldy machinery. You quickly prepare your ship's cargo bay for the new payloads and walk down to Dusk so you can help them carry the instruments aboard.

			`The giant creature floats a few meters away from your cockpit, silent and motionless, but you know that inside the shell, the slug remains alive and well, ready to kill. Compared to some of the Ka'het back in the Graveyard, this is one of the Builders' smaller creations, but its size is still impressive for what is, in essence, a single organism.`
			`	Before setting the <flagship> to automatic station-keeping, you move your ship so that the main hatch is as close as possible to the Fetri'sei. The Remnant are already in the airlock donning their extravehicular suits, and you join them shortly after.`
			`	"When we are inside, there is a high probability we will not be able to communicate," advises Dusk. "Normally, the walls of the armored shell are too thick and dense for our signals to pass through, and the spaces we need to navigate prevent us from using a physical tether. This does not mean we will be unprotected, however. May I see your sidearm?"`
			`	You draw your weapon out of the holster and hand it to him. After a quick examination, he nods and gives it back before continuing. "Once inside, one of our first operations will be connecting to the downlink of the Fetri's telemetry: it is not protected, in our experience, and it is easy to access. From there, we will be able to monitor the vessel's shields.`

If you notice anything out of the ordinary, no matter how minor, take out this gun, point at an empty spot on the shell, and shoot.

					goto entrance
				`	"What about me?"`
			`	"Given that you need to be able to fire as quick as possible, you cannot return to the cockpit. So, we took the liberty of creating a small terminal here to keep an eye on the situation." He points to a small desk in the cargo bay filled to the brim with Remnant machinery.`
			label entrance
			`	One by one, the scientists jump from your ship to the Fetri, moving toward a closed, circular hatch in between the two engines. As you watch them start the expedition, you sit down at the makeshift console, monitoring movements in the system as well as any changes to the slug. Though you can't clearly see what they are doing, you distinguish someone inserting a rod inside a small aperture, followed by the hatch opening right after.`
			`	As the crew moves beyond your line of sight and communications cease, your unease grows steadily. You split your attention between the various screens in front of you and glancing out of the airlock. The clock on your suit's wrist keeps on ticking slowly.`

					goto waiting
				`	(Shoot the Fetri'sei with my sidearm.)`

According to Dusk, one shot should be enough to send the message through the impenetrable armor of the spacecraft, but nothing seems to happen after your gun's energy bolt disperses on the surface of the ship.`
				goto fired
			label waiting
			`	A second later, the creature covers itself in a burst of rose-colored sparks: it's about to jump away! You take the weapon from the table and pull the trigger, releasing a bolt of energy that quickly disperses on the surface of the Fetri'sei. According to Dusk's words, it should be enough to send the message through the impenetrable armor of the spacecraft, but nothing seems to happen after the shot.`
			label fired
			`	Second after second passes relentlessly, with no reaction whatsoever from the Fetri'sei or its surroundings. As the unknown creature fades behind a violet cloud and jumps away, you can't help but wonder what to do.`

					goto shoot
				`	(Keep waiting.)`
					goto wait
				`	(Jump on the Ka'sei to call the Remnant aboard.)`

After remaining airborne for a few instants, you land right next to the leftmost engine nacelle, bouncing off its skin. A timely activation of the thrusters on your wrists helps you move back to its surface, however, and by grabbing a long spike attached to its back, you can finally stabilize and move further ahead.`
			`	White noise starts coming from your communicator; moving your head up, you finally see the Remnant leaping out of the hatch, carrying a dozen faintly glowing cylindrical tubes under their arms. They notice you right when communication returns to normal, and their message arrives loud and clear: "Jump!"`
			`	You leave the handles and use your feet to give you a good push away from the spacecraft. At the last second, you move to the right to avoid ending up behind one of its thrusters just as they roar to life. The Fetri'sei has awakened, and for an instant you see all of its systems activate at once - the engines, the steering, even the Ravagers.`
				goto return

			label shoot
			`	You press the trigger once more, and the projectile again dissolves in the shield protecting the back of the Fetri'sei. For a few seconds still nothing seems to happen, but then, slowly, white noise starts coming from the communicator. Watching the spacecraft, you finally see the Remnant leaping out of the hatch, carrying a dozen faintly glowing cylindrical tubes under their arms.`
				goto continue
			label wait
			`	The wait is excruciating, but after a few seconds, you start hearing white noise coming from your headphones. Right as you start recognizing some words, one of the Remnant leaps out of the hatch, followed closely by the other four. Under their arms, you can distinguish a dozen cylindrical tubes, a faint glow surrounding them.`
			label continue
			`	A flashing warning appears on the console: the energy readings of the other spacecraft are rising quickly. Right as you try to warn the rest of the group, the Ka'sei comes back to life, and for an instant you see all of its systems returning online at once - the engines, the steering, even the Ravagers.`
			label return
			`	Amidst the chaos, you count that all five of them made it out of the hatch, still carrying some of the cylinders with them. They were able to leave before the spacecraft's thrusters started firing, and they seem to have remained relatively unharmed by the event. The Ka'sei moves further and further away.`
			`	One at a time, they move back into the airlock, leaving their cargo attached to one of the instruments they carried with them. As you close the door and pressurize the compartment, Dusk approaches you about the mission.`
			`	"Thank you for that, <first>. We had to cut short the exploration when we saw your message, before we had the chance to retrieve the specific data we were looking for. As a compromise, we decided to take some memory banks - these cylinders - with us, so we could search through the data later. It was dangerous, but it worked.`
			`	"That said, I suggest returning to the outpost as soon as possible. The Ka'sei we have boarded may start acting erratically after this, or it may even attack us; we have removed part of its brain, after all. Hopefully this mission will not backfire against us."`
			`	You sit back in the cockpit, starting the engines once again.`

# The mission here is a complex mashup of game functions that uses many different mechanics to achieve the intended sequence:
# - two ships spawn, one disabled and one functional (but otherwise standing still);
# - the player boards the disabled ship, with the mission happening before their eyes;
# - the other ships jump away right after the mission, and the one the player boarded returns to its normal functions.
# In order to achieve this, the asteroid ship has just over 200 fuel and a negative fuel generation, meaning that it will be unable to jump essentially right after it spawns; removing the spaceport means that it won't be able to refuel on the Builder settlement, and so it remains in space doing nothing but waiting. When the player boards the disabled NPC, it is repaired and returns to its functions; as it is an enemy of the asteroid ship, it will shoot it with every available weapon, including what has been hidden under "Ka'het Machinery": a negative fuel damage weapon, that will instantly refill its fuel reserves and let it jump. Giving it just a capacity of 200 would mean that the game would always think it is just infinitesimally under the threshold to jump, so I gave it 250 and everything works as it should with surprising consistency. Two peculiarities of this are that the player will be able to board the asteroid ship to refuel it, and that the Ka'sei could shoot the asteroid with its ravagers for a split second before it jumps if the position of the two is just right. Both of them are harmless: the health of the asteroid is orders of magnitude higher than the damage the Ka'sei can inflict in that time, and as the player boarding the asteroid will give it exactly 200 fuel because of game mechanics, 1 single frame later it will be already unable to jump. However, in order to account for their oddity I added a small dialog to the asteroid's boarding screen to make it as if you were flying by it, and described at the end of the previous mission how for an instant the Ravagers ignite when the Ka'sei returns online, as if in an unintended burst.

			`Back down on the surface, you complete the post-landing checklist while keeping an eye on the movements of the Ka'sei. The research station has been a safe place to retreat during past expeditions, but it seems doubtful that it could last against a prolonged attack from one of the Fetri'sei.`
			`	When the scientists finish unloading their cargo, Dusk calls you with the communicator. Now that the immediate danger is over, a hint of frustration creeps into his voice.`

			`	The module was never particularly inviting, but over the last few weeks, a thin layer of dust coming from outside the asteroid has covered the floor, with just the surfaces needed for the research kept clean. Tiredness plagues the faces of the scientists: they must not have slept much in the past days to keep up with the amount of incoming data, and neither have you. As you try to remember the last time you stepped outside without a suit - at least a month, most likely - your stream of thoughts is interrupted by the arrival of Dusk, carrying in his hands a ream of papers.`

However, the memory containers we extracted only contain records from the middle of the phenomenon, without showing how it begun or ended. Additionally, understanding their contents is going to take longer than we hoped for. We knew that the exact relationship between the being and the Fetri'sei would be beyond our knowledge, but we cannot even make preliminary guesses as to how they are able to communicate.`
			`	"We have enough consumables to last for many weeks still; we started rationing as soon as we arrived in this sector, and we are prepared to reduce them further if necessary.

At the same time, exploring the asteroid around Lathia may put us closer to understanding the inner workings of the beings and how they interact with the Ka'sei. It is quite dangerous, but visiting the space station is also an unknown, and maybe a more direct approach is what we need to accomplish our objective.

After shutting down the main engines, someone taps on your shoulder to call your attention. "<first>, could you pitch the ship down a few degrees?" Dusk asks, with a calmer look than during liftoff. You reply with a nod, and move the stick forward slightly.`
	`	"There! Do you see it?" he continues, pointing at a spot in the sky with his hand. Between the mass of stars in front of you, a pattern leaps to the eye: two sets of three stars, right next to each other, forming a prism-like structure. "We are back."`

	`A large crowd quickly gathers around your landing pad, eagerly awaiting your arrival. After all this time between the stars, setting foot on a planet with an actual atmosphere is incredibly refreshing. Ignoring the cold weather for a moment, you take the biggest breath you can to make up for the past weeks of recycled air.`
	`	Before you've even reached the end of the ramp, the people on the ground are already signing questions to you and the rest of the team about your journey. You do your best to reply, but in the overall mix of confusion and excitement you aren't sure anyone understood what you just said.`
	`	Between the chaos, you hear a familiar voice singing your name: a few meters on your left, you notice Chilia with his arm raised and a large grin greeting you back. Moving across the crowd not without some difficulty, you follow him through a narrow door inside a cramped room right next to the pad.`
	`	"I prefer this spaceport when it is more hushed," he remarks with a sigh, "but after the past weeks some frenzy is understandable. We will have to make do with this warehouse for now." He invites you to take a seat. "So, <first>, would you tell me about your journey?"`
	`	By the time you're done, more than an hour must have passed. Chilia paces aimlessly around the room, reflecting on your recounting of the events. As silence falls, you notice that calm seems to have returned on the pad as well.`

			goto wait
		`	"Do you know how we came back to this galaxy?"`
		`	"What happened while we were gone?"`
	`	"Oh. I thought you had been told already." He sits down in front of you. "It was us that brought Patir back here. After your departure, it did not take long for our long-range sensors to pick up that the black hole had disappeared, along with you and the team. Our data was scarce, but we knew one, very important thing: if Patir had appeared here once, there must have been a way to do that again.`
		goto explain
	label wait
	`	"If your description is accurate, it means Patir is not another mouth to a pocket universe, but instead a transporter to another galaxy. Or universe, for all we know. In retrospect, there were enough reasons to doubt that first theory, but we were far too busy trying to save you to look into it seriously." Seeing your confused expression, he continues. "<first>, it was us who brought Patir back here.`
	label explain
	`	"We knew Postverta was involved with Patir's initial arrival, and together with the team there, we discovered that the energy burst that had been released when Ssil Vida first appeared had no relation to the systems controlling its pocket universe. So, its activation or deactivation would have no effect on Patir, and we had to start looking somewhere else.`
	`	"Our research up to this point had mostly focused on the pocket universe; most of Postverta is still obscure to us. As we evaluated our options, we determined that, by the time we could understand the station's systems enough to use them for our purposes, your crew would have already run out of supplies and perished. Instead, we attempted to replicate the energy burst using just our technology, augmented by the transmission systems of Ssil Vida.`
	`	"The project took most of our workforce, as well as several weeks to complete, no thanks to a number of setbacks almost making us start over from scratch. But with the full power of the onboard reactors and an array of calculators rivaling that of our largest outposts, its giant antennae came back to life, and released a wave as strong as when Ssil Vida appeared. Two weeks later, Patir returned, and now you are here, safe and sound."`
	`	Finally, a tired Dusk reaches the two of you in the storage room, sitting down after greeting Chilia and you. From a brief exchange between them, you infer that he has also been told of the circumstances around your return.`

			goto patir
		`	"Wait, what if we were not around Patir when it came back?"`
	`	"The black hole would have departed without us, and we would have been still stuck in that sector - only this time without a laboratory to support us, nor most of our consumables. The people down here perhaps could have been able to send Patir back there to pick us up, but by then we would have run out of supplies long before, and perished between the stars. We were lucky that things went the way they did, all things considered. Our research in those systems was supposed to bring us back, and yet we were just chasing rainbows, endangering ourselves further every step we took.`

	`	"It is difficult to say. Given what we have observed, it will probably disappear once again after the effects of our energy burst; when that will happen or where it will go is beyond our current knowledge. Those same systems we were stuck in could now be inaccessible, and our data might be the only information we will ever gather on them.`
	label next
	`	"At this point in time, exploring Patir would be a gamble, and an extremely risky one at that. The next phase will have to be operated from a distance, in order to fully understand the way that system works and how Ssil Vida controls it. How much time that will take, I cannot say; maybe weeks, or months, or even years. But then, and only then, will we go back there and start digging deeper."`

			goto finish
		`	"You want to return there?!"`
	`	Dusk smiles. "It is my job, after all. The danger of the unknown is always a part of it, even in the simplest of missions. I do admit the risk in these past weeks was far beyond an acceptable level, but one day, we will know enough about the mess in which we have become tangled in to unravel it."`

	`	The two of them accompany you to the <ship>, sitting alone in the now-quiet spaceport of <planet>. The cargo bay has been emptied of the vast array of instruments that had been lying in it for a while, and you guess the same has been done with the cockpit. As you walk once again up the stairway, the Remnant bid you farewell. "We have transferred <payment> as a way to express our gratitude," Dusk signs with a smile. "Of course, their worth is incomparable with the value of what you have done for us; without you, we would have never made it out alive. Goodbye for now, and may the Embers aid in your pursuits."`

			`	"What makes it special in this case is the sheer length of time that has passed between the 'death' of the satellite and now. This spacecraft was silent the last time we explored Fereti, which either means it survived for tens of thousands of years and died a few hundred years ago, or that it died at the time of the Builders and only came back to life after millennia - both very fascinating possibilities in their own right.`

			`	"Despite limiting most expeditions to the northern systems, these guidelines still led to the golden age of Builder archeology, giving us incredible insights into the history of this region and its inhabitants. The culmination of this effort was the partial translation of their written language, as well as the decoding of some of their programming. The problem, however, is that this did not extend to their spoken language.`

Dozens of mining outposts are scattered over the surface, some of which are quite big, but none of them give the impression of being in active use. Even the landing pads, almost all empty, have started to show a thin layer of dust and regolith.`
			`	"Just a few decades ago, these buildings were sprawling with activity," Gavriil explains, keeping their eyes on the horizon. "Everyone was on the hunt for Key Stone veins outside of Viminal, and planetary systems tend to have similar characteristics between each other. I will spare you the details, but this turned out not to be the case with <planet>, and most of the infrastructure that had built up here was left without a clear purpose."`

You notice their eyes light up when the target outpost comes into view, just for an instant. "So as not to leave it to rot, a few projects to reuse the abandoned facilities were given the go ahead.

			`	After some brief introductions, you follow the group as it moves down a few ramps of stairs and inside some well-lit tunnels right below the outpost. At the end of them lies a large hangar, wide in both directions but with a rather low ceiling. "We have a few rigs we used to capture test satellites in the past," one of the technicians explains. "They were Remnant spacecraft in those cases, but there is nothing fundamentally preventing their use in your mission.`
			`	"Connecting with the spacecraft after you carry it here is going to be a bit more complicated.

While you can't quite see what one technician is signing from the control console, it must be great news, judging from the cheer that erupts soon after. "The transfer has started!" Gavriil gestures in celebration. They rush toward the terminals at the back of the hangar, almost in disbelief.`
			`	The excitement only slightly wears off as the hours pass, the sheer amount of data taken from the spacecraft boosting it again and again. Finally, Gavriil comes back to you with anticipation. "The transfer is mostly complete by now, and the analysis will soon begin. If you are ready, this would be a good time to return to Ssil Vida - it will take days before any result is ready."`

			`Unlike many of the moons you have visited in the Ember Waste, nothing about Alix stands out as particularly unique.
