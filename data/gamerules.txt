	# Depreciation related game rules:

	# The depreciated value of an item that is "age" days old is calculated with the following equation:
	# Where: "base value" is the undepreciated value of the item;
	# min is "depreciation min";
	# "grace period" is "depreciation grace period";
	# daily is "depreciation daily"; and
	# "max age" is "depreciation max age", and
	# age is at greater than "grace period" and less than "max age".
	# "depreciated value" = "base value" *
	#   (min + (1 - min) * (daily ^ (age - "grace period")) * ("max age" + "grace period" - age) / "max age")
