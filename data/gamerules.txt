# A set of constants and booleans that determine game behavior.

# value is used.
gamerules
	# Determines whether the "universal ramscoop" is active on all ships. This ramscoop
	# provides a very small amount of fuel to every ship regardless of whether they have
	# an actual ramscoop or not. The strength of this ramscoop is scaled with the distance
	# to the system center twice, meaning it falls off much more quickly than a normal ramscoop.
	# DEFAULT: true
	# ALLOWABLE VALUES: false, true, 0, 1
	"universal ramscoop" true
	
	# An attempt to spawn a person ship happens on average every this many frames.
	# DEFAULT: 72000 frames (twenty minutes)
	# ALLOWABLE VALUES: any integer >= 1
	"person spawn period" 72000
	
	# While an attempt to spawn a person ship is made on average every number of frames specified
	# above, a person ship may still not spawn. Each person ship has a "weight" associated with them
	# which determines their chance of spawning. The chance of any single person ship spawning is their
	# weight divided by the sum of the weights of all person ships and this value here. That means that
	# the chance of no person ship spawning is this number over the same sum.
	# DEFAULT: 1000
	# ALLOWABLE VALUES: any integer >= 0
	"no person spawn weight" 1000
	
	# NPC ships with the mining personality will spend this many frames mining in the current system
	# before deciding to do something else. The purpose of this limit is so that NPC ships can be seen
	# by the player to show how to mine without also stripping the system bare of minable asteroids.
	# This limit does not apply to mining ships that are spawned by a mission.
	# DEFAULT: 3600 frames (one minute)
	# ALLOWABLE VALUES: any integer >= 0
	"npc max mining time" 3600
	
	# Ships with the "frugal" personality will only use weapons that consume ammo or fuel while their
	# health is at or below this fraction.
	# DEFAULT: .75 (75 percent)
	# ALLOWABLE VALUES: any value between 0. and 1.
	"universal frugal threshold" 0.75

	# Controls which fighters, when disabled, will not be hit by projectiles unless they are directly targeting.
	# DEFAULT: all
	# ALLOWABLE VALUES: all, none, only player
	"disabled fighters avoid projectiles" "all"

	# Depreciation related game rules:

	# The depreciated value of an item that is "age" days old is calculated with the following equation:
	# Where: "base value" is the undepreciated value of the item;
	# min is "depreciation min";
	# "grace period" is "depreciation grace period";
	# daily is "depreciation daily"; and
	# "max age" is "depreciation max age", and
	# age is at greater than "grace period" and less than "max age".
	# "depreciated value" = "base value" *
	#   (min + (1 - min) * (daily ^ (age - "grace period")) * ("max age" + "grace period" - age) / "max age")

	# The lowest value that a ship or outfit can depreciate to relative to its full price.
	# Captured and gifted items start at this value.
	# DEFAULT: 0.25 (25 percent)
	# ALLOWABLE VALUES: any value between 0. and 1.
	"depreciation min" 0.25

	# Number of days before a new outfit or ship will begin to depreciate.
	# DEFAULT: 7 (7 days)
	# ALLOWABLE VALUES: any integer >= 0.
	"depreciation grace period" 7

	# The percentage of an item's depreciable value that it maintains day over day.
	# DEFAULT: .997 (99.7 percent)
	# ALLOWABLE VALUES: any value between 0. and 1.
	"depreciation daily" 0.997

	# The age (in days), after the end of the grace period, at which an item will become fully depreciated.
	# DEFAULT: 1000 (1000 days)
	# ALLOWABLE VALUES: any integer >= 0.
	"depreciation max age" 1000
	
	# The minimum departure distance for all systems. A ship can only jump out of a system if
	# it is further from the system center than the departure distance. If a system has a
	# defined departure distance greater than this value, that value will be used instead.
	# DEFAULT: 0 (no minimum)
	# ALLOWABLE VALUES: any value >= 0.
	"system departure min" 0.
	
	# Minimum value for the "arrival" property of systems (both "link" and "jump").
	# If the "arrival" value in the system definition is less than the value set here,
	# the gamerule value will be used. If the system defined value is larger than this value,
	# that value will be used. If the gamerule is "unset",
	# the value defined by the system will be used.
	# DEFAULT: "unset" (no minimum)
	# ALLOWABLE VALUES: any real number, or "unset"
	"system arrival min" unset
	
	# The global fleet spawn rate multiplier. A value of 2.0 means twice as many random fleets spawn
	# in all systems, while a value of 0.5 means half as many fleets spawn.
	# DEFAULT: 1.0 (no changes)
	# ALLOWABLE VALUES: any value >= 0.
	"fleet multiplier" 1.

	# Determines whether ammo for most secondary weapons can be restocked at any outfitter.
	# DEFAULT: true
	# ALLOWABLE VALUES: false, true, 0, 1
	"universal ammo restocking" true
