Sophisticated software algorithms allow the turret to correct for a target's motion, making the Blaster Turret effective even against small, quickly moving fighters. Because it needs a special mounting point with a 360 degree field of view, not all ships are capable of being equipped with a turret."

	description "In the early part of the space era, the settlements in the region of space known as the Deep developed in relative isolation from the rest of human space. One result of that isolation is that their weapons technology mostly uses beam weapons, instead of the energy projectile weapons that are more common elsewhere. A Beam Laser has a slightly shorter range than an Energy Blaster, but is also much more energy-efficient and does a comparable amount of damage."

	description "The Heavy Anti-Missile turret has a longer range, higher power, and shorter reload time than its smaller sibling. The only way to overcome it is by firing missiles in a cluster so that while one is being targeted, the others can get through, and as a result all missile systems on the market now default to firing in clusters if multiple copies of the same launcher are installed, rather than staggering their fire as ordinary guns do."

	description "Torpedoes are the most powerful homing weapon, but they move slowly enough that fast ships can simply outrun them, making them most useful against large targets or against small ships at times when they are too distracted to dodge. Torpedo launchers are also much larger than other missile systems, so they are most often found in capital ships."

	description "Typhoon Torpedoes are an improved torpedo technology; they do considerably more damage than ordinary torpedoes. However, they are also much slower, because they are intended mostly for use against large and slow-moving capital ships. As a result, sufficiently skilled pilots can often dodge around them."

	description "Heavy Rockets are the most powerful missile weapon available, but at a price: instead of having a homing system, they simply fire straight forward and rely on a proximity trigger to set them off. Once triggered, however, they damage all ships within their blast radius, making them highly effective against clusters of fighters."
