conversation "intro"
	scene "scene/lobby"
	`The bank's architecture is what you would have called "futuristic" back when you dreamed that the future would be less squalid than the present: story above story of curves and spires and balconies, all in gleaming metal. A doorman stands by each of the heavy transparent doors. Despite wearing your very best outfit you still feel inadequate next to their glittering uniforms.`
	`	The loan broker's office is equally intimidating. Impressive computer monitors fill the walls, with stock quotes and finance data spilling down them almost too fast to read. You occasionally glimpse the names of destinations that you have only seen in movies: Aldebaran. Tarazed. Earth.`
	`	The pen is heavy as lead but glides almost without friction as you print your initials on the bottom of page after page of ominous legal documents and sign several dozen statements, notices, and agreements. The banker, a balding middle-aged man in a suit that you suspect costs more than the spaceship you are about to purchase, nimbly flips through this dense river of legalese, uttering a curt, "Sign here. Now here," as he points to each page. He moves swiftly, mechanically.`
	`	The only moment when he becomes truly animated is when explaining the Truth in Lending statement to you. "You are borrowing 480,000 credits," he says, "to be repaid over the course of one year. Your daily interest rate is 0.4%, which means that your daily payments are 2,503 credits, and by the end of the year you will have paid... 434,000 credits in interest. Sign here." He grins.`
	`	You sign your name one final time:`
	name
	`	The elevator is so well-tuned that you do not even realize it is moving until it has deposited you back in the lobby. You bounce out of its metal chassis. A smile, ear to ear, carries you through the lobby, past the shining doormen, and out into the street. It is not until the end of the block that you finally jump and shout. This crazy adventure suddenly feels real to you. You are going to do it. You are finally going to get off this planet.`
	`	Compared to the bank, you feel much more at home in the shipyard, walking among the rusted out hulks and newer ships that gleam in the sunlight. You hold hands with the smell of grease and dirt and rocket fuel as you drift towards the mechanic. When you ask her what she has in your price range she laughs. "I get one of you about every week." she explains, her face slick with sweat and engine grease. "Yeah alright let's take a look" With that, she leads you to a section of the shipyard with their more modest selections. As you walk, the ships surrounding you go from pristine, to adequate, to worn in, and the two of you finall end up in front of three seasoned vessels. She clasps her arm around your shoulder, chews, and spits. 

"What'll it be, kid?"`

conversation "flight check: no energy!"
	scene "scene/engine2"
	`You have heard more than enough horror stories about the kinds of accidents that can happen when your starship systems malfunction and demand a non-negotiable pre-flight safety check. As you listen to the complex symphony of hums, rattles, and clicks of "<ship>" warming up, you run through a mental checklist. Computers: check. Life support: check.`
	`	Everything goes as expected until it comes time to fire up your systems for a test run...and with a metallic whimper you discover that your generator simply cannot power the entirety of your vessel. With a sigh, you take stock of your options. You will have to either install some new batteries, or switch to a more powerful generator.`	
	
conversation "flight check: no thruster!"

	`You have heard more than enough horror stories about the kinds of accidents that can happen when your starship systems malfunction and demand a non-negotiable pre-flight safety check.

	`	Everything goes as expected until it comes time to fire up the thrusters for a test run... and you realize, with a blush of embarrassment, that you do not have any thrusters installed. A nearby onlooker chuckles and shakes his head. You bashfully try to avoid eye contact as you begin making your way to the nearest outfitter.`

	`	Everything goes as expected until it comes time to fire up the steering engines for a test run. The on-board diagnostic system gives its response and you do a double take as you check it twice. You realize that you somehow do not have any steering installed. You look around for any witnesses. With a sigh of relief, you take solace in the fact that your embarrassment is a private one as you head to the closest outfitter.`
	
conversation "flight check: overheating!"

	`	As you near the end of your checklist, the air begins to grow uncomfortably warm. As you continue working sweat drips onto your flight controls and the air grows thick with the smell of...is something burning? It reeks of ozone and hot metal, and your cameras are showing what looks like a thick gaseous cloud billowing from a bottlenecked exhaust near the engines. As you watch this, you wipe your forehead with the back of your hand and it comes away drenched. If your systems are running this hot while still in the atmosphere, they will definitely overheat the moment you hit hard vacuum. You weigh your options. You are going to have to either install cooling systems, or trade out some components for lower-heat alternatives.`
