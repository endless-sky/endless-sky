	description "The Skylance has been the Quarg’s standard weapon for millennia, and for good reason. Powerful enough to punch through shield and hull alike, accurate enough to eliminate fighters, and small enough to fit on freighters; it’s easy to see why most Quarg captains never use any other weapon. Its only drawback is the sheer amount of energy needed to fire, which is rendered a non-issue by Quarg reactor technology."

	description "The standard Quarg anti-missile system is so ubiquitous it lacks a name. Literally called “The Anti-Missile”, “The Anti-Missile System”, or “The Anti-Missile Turret” the Quarg have never seen a need for another missile defense system. Some have hypothesized that the focus on damage over fire rate may give some insight into the Quarg missile technology of the distant past."

	description "The standard Quarg thruster trades power and space efficiency for a reversible thrusting system. This innovation allows Quarg ships an unprecedented level of maneuverability, if not speed. While most would consider the massive power usage crippling, the Quarg’s reactors are powerful enough to render energy a non-issue."
