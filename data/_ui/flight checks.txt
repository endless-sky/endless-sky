# Conversations shown when launching from a planet with insufficiently equipped ships.
conversation "flight check: no energy!"
	scene "scene/engine2"
	`You've heard enough horror stories about the sort of accidents that happen when starship systems malfunction to be completely convinced of the necessity of a pre-flight safety check. As you listen to the complex symphony of hums, rattles, and clicks of the <ship> warming up, you run through a mental checklist. Computers: check. Life support: check.`
	`	It is all going smoothly until it comes time to fire up your systems for a test run... and you discover that your generator does not produce enough power to power them. You'll have to either install some batteries, or switch to a more powerful generator.`
	
conversation "flight check: no thruster!"

	`	It is all going smoothly until it comes time to fire up the thrusters for a test run... and you realize, much to your embarrassment, that you do not have any thrusters installed. Time to head back to the outfitter and fix that!`

conversation "flight check: no steering!"

conversation "flight check: overheating!"
	scene "scene/engine"
	`You've heard enough horror stories about the sort of accidents that happen when starship systems malfunction to be completely convinced of the necessity of a pre-flight safety check. As you listen to the complex symphony of hums, rattles, and clicks of the <ship> warming up, you run through a mental checklist. Computers: check. Life support: check.`
	`	By the time you reach the end of the checklist, it has grown uncomfortably warm. The air smells like ozone and hot metal, and your cameras are showing a plume of steam or smoke escaping from the hull near the engines. If your systems are running this hot while still in the atmosphere, they're likely to overheat the moment you hit hard vacuum. You are going to have to either install cooling systems, or trade out some components for lower-heat alternatives.`

conversation "flight check: insufficient bunks!"
	scene "scene/engine"

	`	But when you reach the end of the checklist, although nothing appears wrong, you have a sneaking suspicion that something isn't right. You go through the checklist again, but the suspicion only grows. You decide to check the specifications of the ship and each of the outfits you have installed and finally find the issue that was scratching at the back of your mind: you've somehow managed to outfit the <ship> to require more crew than it has space for. You are going to have to either install more bunk rooms, or trade out some components that require extra crew, lest the ship come crashing down during takeoff as a result of not having enough crew to man all the necessary systems.`
