			`	You two catch up as he leads you into the ruins, talking about the "minor" discoveries he has made so far, though he insists to keep the reason he brought you here a surprise. Skipping a long queue, You enter one of the Sheragi buildings that have been uncovered to find that a museum has been set up inside it with various artifacts on display.`
			`	It's strange seeing so many technological devices as old as some of the prehistoric tools from ancient Earth, most of them so deteriorated you wouldn't even be able to imagine what they were used for if it wasn't for the descriptions in each of the displays. One of the most intact relics is a small metal statue of an individual Sheragi in flight, possibly a trophy for some event, or merely a sculpture of a popular character. It's impossible to know, but it shows exactly what they looked like. As you look at how tall the doors of this house are, and back at the statue, you realize how big they must have been. It's hard to imagine the size that a spaceship must have been to even hope to fit a creature this large.`
			choice
				`	"This is an impressive collection."`

			`	"Straight to the point? Fair enough, I'm eager as well, but do come visit the museum some time in the future. There are so many interesting objects."`

			label offlimit
			`	"Here it is!"`
			`	There is a tunnel going deep underground in the room, but Albert sets his attention on a large safe. He elaborates the situation as he opens it up.`
			`	"So, the Sheragi apparently died off in a war of catastrophic proportions. One of our interns suggested we take a closer look underground, to check for military facilities or bunkers, even though our previous scans didn't show anything interesting, so we left her to play with the ground penetrating radar. And wouldn't you believe it, there were some angled pieces of metal under the earth. Clearly man-made. Or Sheragi-made, in this case. It was a bunker that apparently got hit by a powerful kinetic weapon, but we could still salvage some artifacts from the debris. Particularly, this thing."`
			`	Albert opens the safe, and shows you a weathered metal cube, around half a metre on each side. He struggles with the weight, but manages to set it down on the floor.`
			`	"This appears to be a data storage device of some sort. It was connected to what we think were once computers, but nothing else is salvageable after spending thousands of years under wet dirt. Based on how sturdy this thing is, it's plausible that some of the data could have survived, like a time capsule.`
			`	"I have a contact back on Vinci who could probably figure this out, and this is where you come in. You remember John, right? I can't leave the dig site, but I also don't have anyone else I could trust to carry such a valuable artifact. Will you take it there for me?"`

He finds one, but it's so deteriorated that any attempts to use it would be fruitless. He places the cube inside a machine to take a deeper scan of the object, and watches it silently working, staring patiently at the screen.`

Most Hai aren't very fond of looking at the past, and most humans have no idea this place exists. The museum staff is surprised to see a human face, but they let you wander regardless.`
			`	The place has a very unusual architecture resembling Earth's Ancient Greece, but with modern touches of metal, concrete, glass, and plastic. It is built as a very long corridor lined with exhibit rooms. The further in you go, the further back in history you go. The rooms themselves have a distinction between old and new artifacts. One of the rooms you enter has a mural depicting the first contact with the Alphas, pictures of warships, and texts detailing the battles that ensued. The grim artwork shifts to cheery and hopeful halfway through, the green-skinned humans replaced by ordinary ones, and surprisingly rich insights on human biology and culture.`
			`	As you continue to wander further down the aisle, you find rooms dedicated to the Korath raids, their civil war, and the first contact with them, along with a very poetic recounting of the origins of the Unfettered. Going even further, you find even more sections. A long section detailing Hai culture on several different worlds, and how they shifted with time. The fall of the trans-wormhole government, and the decision to pull back into a small territory. The completion of the Quarg ringworld. Hai trade and military culture during their imperial phase. The very grim-looking room on the Hai Civil Wars. Finally, after a very long walk, you arrive at a room nearly at the end of the aisle, recounting the history of the Sheragi.`

				`	(Continue into the Sheragi room.)`
			`	What you see here is a lot richer than what Albert Foster's little museum could ever hope to display. There are pictures of Sheragi military officials of the time, as well as their names and roles. Details on their culture, their biology, and their territorial fights with the Hai are provided as well. There is a huge statue of a bipedal dragon at the center of the room, around 8 meters tall, so large that the ceiling had to be raised. The inscription on it says it's a reproduction of a life-sized Sheragi. A smaller interactive holographic display of one shows details on their biology and behavior. Samples of culture are scarce, but it indicates that they lived under a meritocracy that valued strength and leadership above all else. Their military was fearsome, even with the pre-modern level of technology they had at the time of their demise. You see pictures and rough blueprints of their ships. Angular, multi-layered armor that rivaled what the modern Hai have by sheer mass. If your conversions of the measurements of the spaceships are correct, they were bigger than anything else in human space, dwarfing even the Navy Carrier.

			`It was a long trip, almost halfway across the galaxy. The Hai archaeologists have been friendly to you, giving you updates every time they make a new breakthrough. During this time, the cube, previously thought to be impenetrable, had been disassembled and cleaned. Components that decayed into a mess of oxidized wires and goopy paste over the eons were been identified and removed to substitute for equivalent ones, and a blueprint of the box and its circuits has started to take shape.`
			`	As soon as you land, you call Albert Foster, who doesn't believe you when you say you got alien archaeologists to help. You then look for the three Hai to figure out how they're going to go unnoticed on a human world. You're surprised to find Eyama wearing long, dark but colorful baggy human clothing with an equally oversized hoodie and a bandanna. You recognize this outfit, very popular with the youth these days, who are generally regarded as delinquents by the previous generation.

It hides her body really well at the cost of making her look like a young boy, and the Hai's relatively short stature doesn't help.`

You arrive at the museum and they immediately break character by being very obviously excited to see the exhibits. This probably comes as a relief to onlookers, however, who would normally expect that type of kid to vandalize priceless artifacts.`

			`	They introduce themselves, and very soon the conversation evolves to a kind of jargon even Albert has trouble following. They talk about the box and their findings, while Albert talks about the history uncovered in the dig site and insights on the Sheragi daily life and culture. You close the door to make sure nobody else is startled.`
			`	"We've managed to open the box and we're making a blueprint of it," says Desyo. "Once that's done, we might be able to rebuild the broken pieces and recover the data. We already have documentation on how their hardware worked."`
			`	"The catch is that this is a collaboration now. We'll help you, if you share your findings with us," Rakei continues.`

There's no telling what they thought at the time, but a military fleet was immediately dispatched to eliminate both fleets. One particular ship, which Eyama has translated the name as 'Emerald Sword,' started behaving erratically when given orders. It fired and missed a few shots until it eventually stopped and fled. Clear signs of a mutiny. However, that ship fled to a specific direction, away from any hyperlanes."`
			`	Albert continues, "We think they wanted to flee from the fighting. These were soldiers scarred by the horrors of the war, and they just got ordered to attack what we assume to be refugees. The Emerald Sword was a big ship, likely with an equally large crew, and from the movement data, it's engines were very powerful too, possibly capable of crossing interstellar distances within a Sheragi lifetime. This has some interesting implications. The ship was moving precisely towards a star named Zubenelhakrabi. Not significant enough to show up in the star maps, but we did our survey, and there is a potentially habitable planet there, but zero signs of intelligent life.

planet "Echoes of Tragedy"
	attributes Uninhabited
	landscape land/fog4
	description `From afar, this looks like a habitable planet, comfortably located on the near end of the goldilocks zone of its star. It has high concentration of water vapor in it's atmosphere, and hosts primitive life, with mosses covering nearly all moist surfaces, and small crustacean-like animals roaming the land.`
	description `However, there is an unusually high concentration of toxic chlorine in the lower atmosphere. Without special equipment, one can only stay on the mountains to avoid the dense gas, and even then, only for a few hours before problems arise. Any trace of colonization by the Sheragi has long since eroded away.`
