	description `Nearly a century ago, a Remnant scout exploring space north of the Ember Waste came under fire from an alien fleet armed with weapons that interfered with the scout's engines. The story says that the Remnant captain calmly told her crew, "We aren't going home until we steal that weapon." That alien technology became the basis of the Inhibitor Cannon.`

	description "This weapon was originally developed in an attempt to reverse engineer a long-range energy projectile favored by an alien species that the Remnant encountered nearby. In the process they discovered that by adding more energy to the projectiles they could do a lot more damage in exchange for shorter range, and the Thrasher Cannon was born."

	description "Not long after the Remnant settled on Aventine, they began to discover caches of alien technology in vaults deep under the mountains, guarded by ancient but still-functioning point-defense systems. The Remnant learned how to duplicate those defense systems, and they are now considered to be much more useful than most of the items that they were guarding."

	description "These crystals, mined on the Remnant planet Viminal, can store a surprising amount of power in a compact form. Crystals pure enough to be used in such a manner are hard to find, however."
	description "	Also, the capacitors tend to leak small amounts of energy, in the form of excess heat."

	description "The early Remnant engineers did not trust the finicky and unpredictable nuclear reactors that were then in use in human space, so they instead focused on perfecting the art of radioisotope thermoelectric power."

	description "It is not unheard of for a Remnant ship's engines to draw even more power than its weapon systems: an indication, perhaps, of their preference for avoiding battle when possible."
