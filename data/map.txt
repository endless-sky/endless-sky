	attributes arach factory
	landscape land/sky3
	description `This ancient and quiet world, orbiting a dim red sun, is home to the microchip foundries of House Idriss, the Arach guild that specializes in computers and advanced electronics. Outside of the cities, which are clustered around the equator, Ablub's Invention is uninhabited except by the native lifeforms, including strange, spindly-legged quadrupeds, awkward birds with leathery wings, and amphibians with webbed feet and long, whiskered snouts.`
	spaceport `The day-night cycle here is at least three times as long as any of the Coalition's species are habituated to, so the entire city enters a "false nighttime" in the middle of the day, shuttering all the windows so that the locals can rest and reset their biological clocks. And in the middle of the night, the city is brightly lit for a "false day."`
	spaceport `	The local work schedule has adapted to this unusual cycle, with the two true daytime periods serving the equivalent of the human work week, and the false daytime treated as a weekend, a time for socializing or working at home.`

Ada was originally settled as a mining planet, and the mines here still produce a steady stream of metal to supply the Labs and the many other industrial companies here.`
	description `	From above, the planet looks almost lifeless and barren. Most of the major cities on Ada are built into the walls of the canyons, where they are protected from the high winds and occasional dust storms that sweep across the surface.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is built into the walls of a canyon which has been blasted out to create trenches that are hundreds of meters wide and deep, a network of flight lanes that are well marked out with lights and beacons. Behind the docking caves is a bustling subterranean city where bare rock and gleaming metal have been woven together in an architecture that is both functional and elegant. The lighting in the caverns varies over the course of the day to match the sunlight outside.`

	description `The homeworld of the Arach people, Ahr is a metropolitan world with nearly nine billion inhabitants, enough that they cannot all be fed by what this world produces. The government maintains a storehouse with a month's supply of food in each major metropolitan center, as well as a collection of bioreactors, built according to Kimek designs, that can produce a tasteless but nutritious paste as emergency rations in the unlikely event that shipments of food from off-world are somehow disrupted for a prolonged period of time.`
	spaceport `A constant line of cargo barges and trucks streams through this spaceport city, collecting goods to be distributed to the outlying suburbs and neighboring cities. Inside the main terminal, members of all three Coalition species mix freely, but the Heliarch agents and interpreters here are all Arach.`
	spaceport `	Carts carrying passengers and cargo whiz past at frightening speeds, expertly navigating to dodge the pedestrians.`

	landscape land/snow6
	description `Albatross is a cold ocean world orbiting a small, cold sun. The first settlers on Albatross were anarchists who believed that in a society free from unnatural laws and constraints, everyone would happily and freely work for the common good. The next settlers were pirates who believed that a planet free from laws and constraints would be a great base of operations.`
	description `	The anarchist farming communes, each operating independently but trading with outsiders to gain necessary supplies, are clustered in the barely temperate climate near the equator. The pirate bases, having a much more ready source of supplies, are located wherever there are flat landing areas close to craggy, defensible mountains.`
	spaceport `You are glad you put on a warm coat before leaving your ship. The wind blows in strong gusts down the streets of this small spaceport town. You pass by ranchers herding cattle, a few farmers driving old, rusted-out trucks full of produce, and a couple of shady figures huddled in an alleyway negotiating what looks like a drug deal. In the center of town is a small merchant's exchange and a couple of greasy spoon diners.`
	spaceport `	The sign over the spaceport bar reads, "No Gods, No Masters." Below it in slightly smaller writing is another sign which reads, "No Cybernetic Implants. No Badgers, Weasels, Or Polecats." You have no idea what a "polecat" is.`

planet Alexandria

	landscape land/space7
	description `At the height of the Alpha War, the government of the Deep constructed Alexandria as the galaxy's largest storehouse of human literature, scientific writing, and technology. It also houses a vast museum of cultural artifacts dating back to long before the start of the space age. Today the station is mostly populated by visitors looking for particularly arcane writings or information, and librarians who have devoted their lives to keeping the archives well-indexed and up to date.`
	description `	Entire sections of the station are off limits to ordinary visitors. There are many rumors about what those restricted areas contain.`
	spaceport `The station's cavernous visitor center is by far the quietest spaceport you have ever been in. Many people are bustling back and forth, wheeling carts of old books or carrying data pads, but they are entirely silent except for the occasional startled outburst when a scholar, walking deep in thought or immersed in reading, accidentally collides with someone.`
	spaceport `	From here, passageways lead off into the wings of the library in a veritable labyrinth of hallways, stairs, and library stacks. A few particularly heavy doors require key cards to enter, and others have no opening controls of any sort that you can see.`

planet Alfheim
	attributes deep oil factory
	landscape land/nasa3
	description `Alfheim is a world of wide grassy plains, deserts, a few small oceans, and scattered rainforests. Not a pleasant enough planet to support large cities, it is instead mostly a site for oil drilling and manufacturing. So far only a tiny fraction of the surface has been developed, mostly clustered around the sites where the largest oil deposits have been discovered.`
	description `	Settlements show up as small bright points on the dark side of the planet - not from city lights, but from natural gas burnoff at the drilling stations.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is in the middle of a field of oil derricks so vast that from above, the desert seemed to be covered in spiky grey fur. The spaceport itself is a soaring canopy, made to look like a tent, or sails on a ship. But it is built of a sturdy composite of plastic and carbon fiber, and coated in reflective plastic. Inside, hovercraft and massive sand-crawlers are bringing cargo to and from the refineries and factories scattered across the planet's surface.`

The factories are almost entirely maintained by robots, which are capable not only of repairing damage but also of constructing entire new factories according to predefined plans.`
	description `	The solar collectors are mounted on frames about ten meters above the shifting sand dunes. In addition to turning to face the sun, they can be turned upside-down as necessary to dump off any sand that accumulates on them.`

The first settlers came here more than thirteen thousand years ago, at a time when their home world had run out of arable land for farming and food was desperately needed.`
	spaceport `The constant stream of freighters passing through this spaceport is a testament to how much food is needed to feed the densely populated Kimek worlds, in particular their homeworld in the neighboring star system.

The cafeteria is so crowded that many workers are just standing up against the walls eating off their trays instead of trying to find a place to sit.

Some of the solar farms are so large that from orbit, the light reflecting off them could almost be mistaken for lakes and small oceans. However, there is almost no water on the planet's surface except near the poles.`
	spaceport `Like most Hai architecture, the spaceport is made of bare, unpainted metal, so weathered that you would not be surprised to learn that it is tens of thousands of years old.

Supposedly the Quarg have lungs designed for a continuous one way airflow, like a bird's lungs, rather than the ordinary in and out flow of human lungs; this is what enables them to survive on low-gravity, low-atmosphere worlds.`

However, the powerful tectonic forces here have created rich deposits of diamonds, emeralds, and sapphires, which are mined both for use in jewelry and for certain electronic components. Mining a tectonically active world is an insane project, and earthquakes cause frequent cave-ins, but the potential of wealth draws miners here despite the high mortality rate.`

	spaceport `The spaceport is perched on top of a peak in an older and more stable mountain range. The landing pads here are used both by starships and by the helicopters that bring cargo to and from the mines. Overhead, helicopters fly by carrying heavy loads dangling from cables. A few low cement buildings serve as warehouses, and on the far end of the port, where an explosion would do the least damage if a sudden, severe earthquake struck, large steel tanks hold deuterium for refueling ships. Asphalt roads with flimsy guard rails connect the landing pads to the warehouses.`

Another, equally large species of spider is able to leap four or five meters into the air in order to snatch a bird out of a passing flock. The rainforest trees grow so thick that except for occasional clearings, very little light actually filters through the leaves and reaches the ground, and during the rainy season the dirt is transformed into pools of stagnant mud.`

Today, most of the industry centers around oil drilling and manufacturing, and the remaining workers are those who are too poor to leave.`
	description `	In recent years, Geyser's economy has not been able to support repairs to the centuries-old terraforming equipment, and as a result the climate has become increasingly arid, and it is difficult to grow food crops here.`

A ring of hangars with arched cement ceilings surrounds a central complex of warehouse towers, whose upper stories once held food courts and luxury hotel rooms. But now, many of the hangars have collapsed, and the ones that remain have rugged plastic netting bolted to the ceilings to protect ships from falling fragments of cement. Only one of the food courts remains active, and although a few of the hotel rooms are still used, the marble fixtures and tile floors that were once so polished and clean are now chipped and cracked and worn down.`

	description `Mars was humanity's first attempt at terraforming. Although it remains a dry, cold desert, the air is now breathable without an oxygen tank, and there are sections of the planet where a fair number of plants can grow. Because far more hospitable planets are available to those with enough money to pay for interstellar travel, the farms and ranches of Mars are run mostly by poorer Earth families who want to escape the pollution and congestion, along with some young adults who do farm work to help finance their once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to stand on another world.`
	spaceport `The spaceport on Mars is situated next to the northern Polar Basin, one of the few places where, post-terraforming, a natural lake exists. Here, far more trees grow than elsewhere on the planet, and in the few warm months when the lake is not frozen, Mars almost looks like a friendly place.`

Aside from the refueling station and a few sheds, there are no other buildings, just an open field of packed gravel, with grass and weeds peeking up in places where it has avoided the blast from landing spacecraft. A few farmers have parked wagons here and are trading food and other goods with the visiting ships.`

A century ago, some entrepreneurs settled here and built a factory complex that is entirely powered by wind and solar energy, because there are so few cloudy days here and the wind and sunshine are so reliable. The factory is mostly autonomous, with only a few thousand people living here to perform maintenance or to grow crops in irrigated fields.`
	spaceport `The spaceport consists of a few large concrete slabs, each big enough for a dozen small ships or a pair of bulk freighters to land on. Farther away are fields of solar panels and the factories that they power. The spaceport buildings themselves, however, are underground, where less energy is needed to keep the air cool. Light pipes bring sunlight down from the surface to illuminate the subterranean storage caverns and living quarters, while keeping the searing heat of the sunlight out.`

From the port town, tourists can ride a cog railway to the tops of several of the tallest mountains nearby.

It now serves both as a center of finance and trade, and as the seat of the Heliarch government, which is made up of "elders" who have been selected by the other Heliarchs from among their number in such a way that all three species always have equal representation. The Heliarchs, in turn, are selected from among the best and brightest members of each species. Despite the occasional resistance to it, this meritocracy has survived ten times longer than any human democracy.`
	spaceport `At any given time, thousands of young people are in training here to become "interpreters," the Heliarch agents who serve as translators and mediators on all the Coalition worlds. As they rise through the ranks, some of those agents will be honored by being elevated to the rank of Heliarch, gaining a voice in the selection of new elders and perhaps one day even being selected themselves.`

The air is too thin for humans or Hai to breathe without carrying supplemental oxygen tanks, so the population is very small. The fields are tended by enormous spider-like robots which are equipped not only for irrigation and harvesting, but also for pollination, since the thin atmosphere has made it impossible for native insects to evolve here.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is a small city built under a pressurized glass dome, with a ring of hangars and landing pads around its periphery. As with most Hai architecture, the dome and the buildings within it are simple and sparsely decorated, but as you walk through the city everything feels very solid, and ancient. Everything is metal, even the roads and walkways, and the center of many of the roads dips down slightly due to millennia of foot traffic slowly wearing down the metal.`

	spaceport `The spaceport is unusually large and clean for a planet with such a low population. It is clear that tourism here is a profitable industry. One large booth offers airplane rides to view the "dragons" up close, for anyone willing to sign a waiver; even with energy shields, it is not unheard of for a plane to be snatched out of midair by one of the creatures. Other booths offer safari tours of the forest; the tourists in line at those booths are carrying a wide variety of knives and guns.`
