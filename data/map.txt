The next settlers were pirates who believed that a planet free from laws and constraints would be a great base of operations.`
	description `	The anarchist farming communes, each operating independently but trading with outsiders to gain necessary supplies, are clustered in the barely temperate climate near the equator. The pirate bases, having a much more ready source of supplies, are located wherever there are flat landing areas close to craggy, defensible mountains.`

Aside from tourism, most of the planet's income is from petroleum mining.`

	spaceport `The Amazon spaceport is unique, built on top of tall pillars more than fifty meters above the ground, directly above the forest canopy.

It would be an ideal farming world if it were not for the fact that the native plants are so abundant and so well adapted to this environment that they can take over an untended field in a matter of months. Farmers typically start the growing season by slashing and burning the plants that have taken root in their fields over the winter, and even so they must be constantly vigilant for weeds throughout the summer.`
	description `	The Big Sky government recently financed a major project to genetically engineer a goat species so ravenous that it can control the growth of local vegetation. These "ubergoats" pose so great a threat to the typical biosphere that they are export-controlled as biological weapons.`
	spaceport `The landing pads here are being gradually consumed by the local plant life. In most places grass and ivy has crept out to cover at least a meter of the pad on all sides, and every small crack or crevice has been colonized by moss and by the roots of larger plants. In places the forest has been cleared to make roads leading to the nearby farming villages, but in most directions all you see is green.

	spaceport `The spaceport is not fancy, but it is serviceable: the landing pads are very level and show only minor signs of wear and tear, and the one warehouse is tiny but recently built, and its roof is in good repair.

Everything is made of gleaming metal, and each tower is slightly tapered and adorned with painted fins that make it resemble an enormous starship.`

The original settlers arrived in the first century after the discovery of spaceflight, coming with the goal of simply getting as far away from civilization as possible. The colony has reinvented itself countless times since then as different leaders have taken control, and in fact at present it is split into two separate towns, East Mesa and West Mesa.`
	description `	The environment is a mix of deserts and brackish oceans, with a fair amount of native wildlife and good potential for farming. Anywhere else in human space, this planet would have become densely settled, but out here it has remained mostly empty.`
	spaceport `Apparently anarchists are not opposed to commerce as long as no one is regulating it. Half of the landing pads in the spaceport are available for ships; the other half have been taken over by farmers busy selling their produce, or merchants buying from incoming ships and piling crates into large trucks.`

	spaceport `Every Hai city has an appearance of great age and permanence, but this one, even more so. In Hai cities, transport vehicles carry freight and passengers along underground passages or elevated railways, while the pathways at ground level are reserved for foot traffic.

The atmosphere is barely thick enough to be breathable, and none of the plants that grow here are useful for eating. However, because it is only a large moon instead of a full-sized planet, moving cargo and fleets of ships to and from its surface is fairly easy and inexpensive.`
	description `	Conducting any business here is a nightmare of tedium. Syndicate doctrine claims that corporate structure and process produce a leaner and more effective military force without the perceived wastage of the Republic Navy. But in practice, they seem to have combined all the worst aspects of military and corporate bureaucracy.`

Today, most of the industry centers around oil drilling and manufacturing, and the remaining workers are those who are too poor to leave.`

	spaceport `This spaceport was built seven or eight centuries ago, and its once-grand architecture has now fallen into decay. A ring of hangars with arched cement ceilings surrounds a central complex of warehouse towers, whose upper stories once held food courts and luxury hotel rooms. But now, many of the hangars have collapsed, and the ones that remain have rugged plastic netting bolted to the ceilings to protect ships from falling fragments of cement.

No longer prisoners, the inhabitants who remain do so because they prefer a simple life beyond the reach of any government, on a planet that will never be stolen from them because it carries nothing of value.`

	description `New Austria is a rugged mountain world, full of snow-capped peaks and valleys so deep and so steep that they rarely see sunlight. The few settlements that have been built here were developed for mining sapphires and rubies; the sapphires found in New Austria range from blue to yellow to black to clear in color, and are used both for industrial abrasives and for jewelry. For centuries the locals have been trying to find a deposit of diamonds, which would sell for much higher prices than sapphires, and local folklore revolves around the prosperity that would come to this world if diamonds were ever discovered.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is nothing but a couple of landing pads built on the outskirts of one of the larger mining villages, high up on a mountain ridge to allow easy access for starships. A few roads lead down from there to the village, where you can trade for local goods or get food from the miners' cafeteria. By the time you have walked to the center of the town, several people have already tried to sell you large "diamonds" that you strongly suspect are just clear sapphires.`

Many of the concrete landing pads have sunk into the muddy soil over the years since they were poured, and are now tilted and uneven. The market where ship captains buy and sell cargo is a large tent rather than a permanent building, but it is sturdy enough to keep off the rain, and high enough for loads to be brought in and out by trucks and the occasional hovercraft.

The oceans are so bountiful that the locals say that only a fool or a very lazy person would starve here; there are enough fish even near shore that most families just own a small boat rather than the larger vessels designed for the deep ocean.`

It is built half on land, and half over the water, with a series of bridges and wide canals allowing foot traffic above and cargo barges below. The bridges are built with stone arches rather than steel truss structures, partly to allow more clearance for boats below but also partly just for appearance. For a spaceport, it is an unusually beautiful place.`

It is one of the few places in the galaxy where cotton is picked by hand, because labor here is cheaper than the cost of buying and maintaining machinery.`
	description `	The locals are prevented from seeking more lucrative employment elsewhere partly by the crushingly low wages, which make the cost of space transport prohibitively high for most, and partly by the educational system, which is among the worst in the galaxy.`
	spaceport `The spaceport consists of a vast asphalt-paved field for landing ships, and some wooden buildings a few stories tall. Most of the materials for export are stored in sheds or stacked under plastic tarps, with a few police officers clustered around them to make sure no ship picks up cargo that has not been paid for. Inside the buildings, two restaurants with different names serve an identical selection of fried foods.`

When the colony was first established, the Earth government did not yet have the strength to control any system but its own, and when the Republic was formed, Thule did not join, and has repulsed all efforts to force them to do so. It is well-known that the planet sponsors pirate fleets which bring it cheap materials to bolster its economy, but the planet is so far from the center of Republic space that fighting a war here would be prohibitively expensive, and so they remain unopposed.`
	spaceport `The inhabitants of Thule are notoriously suspicious of strangers. They all seem to immediately recognize you as an off-worlder, perhaps by your clothing or your accent. The food sold in the shops is like nothing you have seen elsewhere, and the natives' accents are so strong that they almost seem to be speaking a different language. You feel as if you are visiting an alien world; centuries of separation has created a culture here that is very different from your own.`
