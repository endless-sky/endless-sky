			`You step out of the <ship> and look again at the strange sight of the Caelian spaceport. You still aren't used to a structure that looks as much like it grew from the landing pads as it was built next to them. The dock side entrance is busy so when your commlink vibrates, you have to find a place where the traffic eddies and you can step aside and learn that you need to check in with the Information Desk.`			
			`	The woman working the desk seems startled to see you when you walk up. You can see the realization dawn on her as she scans your clothes. "Ah," she sings, "you are the ancestral sojourner among us."`
			`	You are getting used to being gawked at. So, you take it in good humor and respond by singing, "The Embers guided me to friends I didn't know, and your message invited me to meet a new one."`
			`	Her hands make a short series of shakes and a moment later she remembers to laugh for you. The delayed response makes her laugh again, spontaneously this time, and you both join in. When she recovers herself, she sings, "Logistics have requested that we find someone who can carry 30 tons of cargo to Viminal. Is the <ship> available immediately?"`

				`	(I'm not interested in small cargo jobs)`
					goto notinterested
			label willdo
			`	"Certainly," you chant, curious now as the job board has been stubbornly empty when you've checked.`
			`	"Excellent," she responds in a full alto, "I will let the project manager know the cargo will arrive tomorrow." She signs what you think is a farewell and turns to sign to someone else who has stepped up.`
			`	You manage to chant and point your way through the cafeteria line and you are aware of the flurry of signs around you. There doesn't seem to be a way to pay, so you find a table and sit alone until your commlink chimes to let you know that the <ship> has been refueled and the mystery cargo loaded.`

			`	"That is unfortunate," she sings as she makes a notation on her terminal. "But there will be others who are willing to help."`

			`You step off the <ship> in Viminal to see a man wandering around your ship taking video with a datapad and softly singing some running commentary. He dodges around the dock workers unloading and refueling the ship, seemingly intent on recording every aspect of your ship.`
			`	"Cousin!" he sings with excitement, when you walk up to him. "It is good to meet you and to see your wonderful ship. I've only seen such designs in our historical entertainments." He holds up the data pad facing you and says, I'm making a video for my companion. He won't believe me if I don't, and maybe not even then!" he laughs. You wave awkwardly at the camera and are relieved when he stops recording.`  
			`	"I hope I haven't offended you," he sings. "I get carried away looking at ships." You worry briefly that he is going to interrogate you about the <ship> when he adds, I'm Eon. Would you have time to talk about logistics support?"`
			choice
				`	"Yes, I'm always open to new opportunities."`
					goto opportunities
				`	"No, I'm not interested in cargo work at the moment."`
					goto disappointed
			label disappointed
			`	Eon makes no attempt to hide his disappointment at your reply. "I'm sorry to hear that," he recites. "There was much good we could have done with your help." He stands and makes a short sign that seems to mark the end of the conversation. "Fortunately," he sings, "we deliver projects as a team, so the work will still be done." They way he sings it makes you think it's a slogan of some sort. Eon puts away his datapad and follows the crates to the loading dock.`
				decline
			label opportunities
			`Eon leads you to the cafeteria, chattering about ship design since the Alpha Wars. He buys a couple of hot drinks and leads you to a table overlooking the docks which is a little less noisy. You try your drink. It's strongly flavored but a bit odd. It's probably someone's memory of what coffee should taste like, reconstituted from local foods.`
			`	The man leaves his untouched as he launches into song, "Those of us in logistics have noticed that you are spending time in our systems, and we wanted to see if you would be available to pick up work for us. It would be delivery work like the reactors your brought for the housing project."` 
			choice
				`	Chant, "You put reactors in your houses?"`
					goto houses
				`	(Nod to continue.)`
					goto delivery
			label houses
			`	"You don't?" he responds playfully. "We maintain a decentralized power grid so we have more resiliency in the event of an attack or natural disaster. It also makes use of the power plants we salvage from the Korath and ones we recover from our own damaged ships. Besides, widely deploying the technology ensures that we have expertise to maintain and repair it all across the Remnant. But," he chants and signs a pushing motion, "civil engineering is another subject. I hope you are more interested in how we move our various cargoes throughout Remnant space."`
				goto delivery
			label delivery
			`	You nod to agree and he continues, "Those reactors were scheduled for delivery 30 days from now, but they were ready earlier and the project is able the install them now. So, by bringing them over, you've enabled us to move the project forward and free up delivery capacity next month."`
			`	"So, why did you offer this work to me?" you sing, trying to mimic the gestures you've seen that you think refer to one's self.`
			`	He smiles and sings, "Very good! Very good! We schedule everything but we maintain slack in the system to take advantage of opportunities like the reactors being ready early, or to deal with emergencies. Sometimes, of course, we have to drop everything and sort the schedule out later. But, in normal times, we publish these jobs on the job board and captains that have capacity available can pick them up. The projects provide resource allocations to cover operating and crew costs, but there is no...what is that word? Margin! Yes! So the payment might not be what you are used to. Since your ship isn't in our planned resources, you provide extra capacity and we might be able to move some of our larger projects forward when you are in our space.`
			choice
				`	"Won't your pilots be upset at the competition?"`
					goto competition
				`	"Thanks for the opportunity."`
					goto thanks
			label competition
			`	Eon smiles at the question. "You should talk to the other pilots and see. But, I think the ancestral space approach is different. We work more like how I imagine the navy does in the Republic. The ships are owned by the Remnant, but each captain is responsible for the ship, the crew, and the transport work that needs to be done. I think they will be happy to see new homes being built for families, and, "he winks at you, "spending more time with their own."`
				goto thanks
			label thanks
			`	Before you can ask more about transport jobs, Eon takes out his commlink and taps on it for a few minutes. "I've added you to the job board. You should be able to see our current job list for each system when you check."`
			`	You chat with Eon about how you've outfitted the <ship> as you finish your...coffee. Then, his commlink chirps. As he stands, he signs what you think means 'Goodbye' as he sings that he has to leave for another meeting. He walks off quickly with his head down looking at the datapad. Your commlink notifies you that <payment> credits has been added to your account.`
