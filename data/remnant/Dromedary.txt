	description "The Tycho Crater Cooperative's Dromedary was one of the foremost colonization ships during the early era before piracy became rampant and triggered the necessity for cityships to be more combat-oriented. These ships incorporate extensive hydroponics, large construction equipment installations, and hundreds of densely packed 'coffin quarters' built to transport people in bulk."
	description "	As a memorial to the original Last Light, the Remnant have agreed to build a copy for you. As the Remnant do not have any original models for it, this is not actually a true Dromedary, but rather a replica of the highly modified ship, built with largely Remnant internal systems. Unfortunately, since they lack the manufacturing facilities that would have normally supported such a production, it will cost massively more than it would have back on Luna."
