			`Although they are unusually tall and dark-skinned, the people here appear to be human. You wouldn't know it from the architecture, however: the buildings with their curved, twisted surfaces and ramifying arches look more alien than any human dwelling you have seen before.`
			`	Stranger still, no one is speaking: the usual background murmur of voices that you would associate with a spaceport is absent here. Instead, the locals are communicating in a rapid and graceful sign language, their hands tracing arcs through the air almost faster than your eyes can follow.`
			`	A few of them approach your ship and one of them greets you out loud, but instead of speaking he sings the words in a high, monotone chant: "Do you comprehend the ancestral tongue?"`

			`	Two of them walk up to you. One is carrying a small device that looks like a handheld scanner. The other unwraps a small foil package, pulls out a lancet, and jabs his finger with it. A dark, red drop of blood wells up. He presses his finger onto a port on the scanner, then hands you another one of the packets. "We kindly request that you identify yourself," he chants. Several of the others hum along with him.`

			label no
			`	You try to pull away, but the man's hand snakes out and grabs you by the wrist. Before you are even able to react he jabs your finger and shoves it onto the scanner. "You are in our space," he sings. "You will abide by our rules." No longer a monotone, his song is a jarring and atonal melody.`

			`	Several of them gather around the one with the scanner as if waiting to see what the results will be. As you watch them you notice that all of them, even the women, have their hair cropped short. Also, their clothing looks like nothing that has ever been in fashion at any point in human history that you know of.`
			`	Finally the scanner beeps, and a yellow light flashes. You can almost feel the tension leaving the air as the crowd relaxes. "So you are pure. You are human," chants one of the women. "You are one of us."`
			choice
				`	"Of course I'm human. But what are human beings doing out here?"`
				`	"Who are you?"`

			`	Several of them burst into song, singing together in harmony, "We are the hidden ones. We are the Remnant. In time of great chaos to this place we came, lest all true-born humans be killed or enslaved, by those who evolved not, but unwisely were made."`
			`	As they continue to sing, you begin to piece together their story. They are the descendants of people who fled to this region of space through an unstable wormhole at the peak of the first Alpha War, which means they have been here for more than half a millennium. That doesn't explain why their culture is so radically different, though.`
			`	Eventually they invite you to a dinner. Their food has strange and complex flavors, not all of them pleasant, but you do your best to be polite and pretend to enjoy it all. The meal itself is generous and stretches out as your hosts consume considerably more food than you would expect for such a trim group. After the meal, they entertain you by singing songs, some of which you recognize as classical Earth music. It appears that people in this culture use sign language for day to day communication, and use their voices only for making music.`
			`	When you return to your ship, you do a search on videos of historical dialects of human sign language. None of them bear even a passing resemblance to the language of these people who call themselves the Remnant.`

Enough money and the right connections, and licenses for anything can be acquired. These?" He holds up a Remnant license. "Not so much." He shakes his head and becomes serious. "Now, your license has a handful of connection pads on the bottom which can be connected to your ship's IFF. When you are inbound for landing, simply tap this code on the license, and the cube will verify the pattern as well as your fingerprints and a few other biometrics to ensure you are indeed living and conscious, and then transmit an encrypted code.

It is what determines which ships should be highlighted red or orange on your system map, and provides limited movement detail to allied ships so that targeting systems can fire past you. I do not know about their current practices, but historically the Navy and most other organizations had complex methods of verifying the identify of other ships, so it is not simply a case of having your IFF state that you are a friendly."`

Since then the various monitors of the system have had to manually designate you as 'friendly' every time you made an approach. It worked, for a time. But now it is time to make your acceptance official. While our monitors are effective, it still wastes time to force them to track you and cancel the alerts every time you approach.

"Now, insert your license here, and tap your pattern on the license." He looks away as you follow his directions.`

If there is a threat following you in - an enemy ship or some other kind of danger you want the monitors to watch for, pinch or squeeze the license instead. And if you have a problem onboard, such as having been captured and forced to fly the ship in, tap the license in a random pattern. Lastly, if you are having trouble landing due to injury or damage to the ship, just press briefly on the license. If you don't touch the license at all, the monitors will assume that you are either incapacitated or otherwise not in command of your ship. We will still attempt to let you land safely and provide assistance, but will also be standing ready to destroy you and block your approach if we think you are becoming a threat."`

			`	You proceed with the approach and landing, with the prefect pointing out noteworthy features along the way. He also points out various approach paths, including preferred routes to take if you are being chased. "If you have a hostile threat on your tail, take this landing corridor, which will expose trailing ships to fire from these points. And if you have something sticking tight in your shadow, do a roll at this point or that point. That will expose them to our high-precision batteries."`

Once the <ship> has settled safely to the ground, the prefect pulls the license from the socket and hands it back to you. "At the risk of sounding like a parody: keep it secret, keep it safe.

			`While searching for the director's desk in the Aventine spaceport, you are very conscious of all the conversations going on around you. You manage to catch a word here and there, but not enough to understand the conversations. With some trouble, you ask for directions using what you have learned, and you arrive at a similar desk in a busy plaza.`
			`	It looks like the person behind the desk has been expecting you. They gesture very slowly, asking how your lessons are going using very basic signs and songs. After a few minutes of conversation, they ask you to place your hand on the scanner, which takes a sample of your blood, and then give you a data chip with more lessons.`
			`	You return to your ship and begin going through the lessons. These lessons focus more on purely conversing through sign with almost no singing.`
			`	Just as last time, the screen goes black and reveals a note saying that there will be a final package of lessons waiting for you on Viminal.`

			`As soon as you land, you look around for someone to ask directions from. Approaching a dockhand who doesn't appear to be busy, you carefully sign, "Can you direct me to the port director?" He looks at you curiously for a moment and replies with exaggerated slowness. You thank him and head towards the spaceport following his directions.`
			`	Once again the director seems to be expecting you, and has a simple conversation with you about how the flight was and how your lessons are progressing. You manage to convey that you have learned a bit, and he gives you a few tips on your rehearsed phrases before directing you to place your hand on the scanner. Once again, the scanner takes a sample of your blood.`
			choice
				`	(Sign asking what the scanners are for.)`
				`	(Sing a verse about my confusion of the hand scanners.)`
			`	The man begins to sign, but then realizes that you don't understand much of what he is signing, so he switches to singing. "Long ago it was decided that being infiltrated by Alpha agents was a big risk, and we couldn't depend on our interstellar network to remain secure. So we implemented a policy where the first time a Remnant is granted formal access to a new planet their purity and identity is verified. Thus even if someone hacked our networks to give themselves a clean identity, they would still be caught when they started working on a new planet. We also don't broadcast that requirement on our networks, simply enforce it locally. It isn't foolproof, but it adds an additional layer of safety."`
			`	You thank the man for explaining the scanners to you and accept the next set of lessons.`
			`	You spend a few hours viewing some of the lessons, one of which involves watching an ancient show about a merchant captain making his way through the galaxy with an unlikely crew, re-enacted by a cast of Remnant who sing and sign their way through the dialogs with exaggerated simplicity. It is oddly familiar, but you can't quite place it. You notice that it seems to have a lot of subtext about the dangers of manipulation and government secrecy, especially surrounding genetics.`
			`	Skimming through the rest of the lessons, you notice that there is a lot more here than the last two times. It may take some time to get through it all, but you should be fairly fluent if you practice over a couple of months.`

			`	You look up the location of Ivan's office that he gave you back when you helped him save the science drone in Terminus and find that it is in a building just outside the spaceport - just one room among many in a massive office complex. The complex looks pristine by Dirt Belt standards, but when compared to architecture you've seen elsewhere in the Deep, it is rather brutalistic.`
			branch gone
				has "Deep: Remnant Research: offered"
			
			`	You ask a receptionist what Ivan's room number is, and he points you to a room on the twentieth floor. After taking an elevator up, you knock on the door to Ivan's office.`
			`	"Who is it?" Ivan says before peeking out the blinds. "Oh! Captain <last>! Please, come in."`
			`	Ivan opens the door and lets you inside. The office is cramped, the walls almost entirely obscured by filing cabinets. Ivan walks over to a desk that he barely has space to get behind, picking up a collection of papers and shoving them into the nearest cabinet. "Sorry about the mess," he says nervously. "I didn't know you were coming. Is there something I can help you with?"`
			choice
				`	"I was wondering if you'd found out anything new about the anomaly in Terminus."`
				`	"Do you think I could get a copy of your research on the anomaly in Terminus?"`
					goto "terminus copy"
			
			`	"Oh, yes. We haven't been able to do too much with what funding we have left, but we have made one important discovery." Ivan turns to one of his filing cabinets and pulls out some sort of graphic that you would guess is depicting the anomaly, but you can't make any sense of it.`
			`	"One of our ideas has been that the anomaly is some sort of unstable wormhole. Reports of its existence go back to at least the times of the first Alpha War, with rumors that ships have left for Terminus to never return, presumably having entered the anomaly somehow. Now I'm not one to go off of rumors, but they certainly have to come from somewhere, so the idea was at least worth investigating.`
			`	"Going under the assumption that it is a wormhole that is simply too unstable to allow a ship to pass through, we wanted to see if we could get anything at all to pass through it. What we've discovered is that given a small and smooth enough object, we can get it to disappear within the anomaly without a trace." He then pulls out a small metallic sphere about the size of a ping pong ball from one of the cabinets and dangles it from an attached wire.`
			`	"Now this is only a model, but we created a number of small sensors about this size and sent them through the anomaly. We'd hoped that we could take some readings from whatever is on the other side of the anomaly, as it clearly goes somewhere, but we only ever get static coming back through the wire, followed by nothing a few minutes later. And unfortunately, whatever we send in we can't seem to pull back. The wire always snaps.`
			`	"So the anomaly is clearly a wormhole. Now we just need to figure out how to get whatever we send into it to come back and how to get something the size of a ship to enter it."`
			`	"Sounds like you're making good progress," you respond. "Do you think I could get a copy of your research so far?"`
			
			label "terminus copy"
			`	"A copy?" Ivan looks off into space for a moment. "Well, I suppose since you helped save us from losing valuable equipment, I could make an exception for you. I typically don't share findings with those not on my research team until they're finalized. I've been burned one too many times because of that."`

			`	The receptionist spends a few minutes tapping away at a keyboard. "Looks like he had his office moved to... the Deep Polytechnic Institute of Valhalla?" he says with a surprised look. "Oh wow, must have gotten someone's attention in the government to be moved there. Do you need directions?"`
			choice

Several planets in the Deep, Paradise Worlds, and even many near Earth have a similar university district, but the one on Valhalla is the largest of its kind in the entire Republic.`
			`	As you enter the district, you note that the architecture here is much more appealing than the brutalistic style of Ivan's old office building. Each edifice consists of more curves than right angles, with a textured metallic sheen decorating its surface. Brilliant facades scatter sunlight to give the area a warm glow, as opposed to directing it right into your eyes if you happen to be standing in the wrong spot. Even among all the metallic structures, there is still a good amount of greenery: well-trimmed bushes and trees line the streets, and many of the buildings are topped with gardens.`
			`	You ascend the stairs of the Institute, the massive building looming over you as you approach. Its more ancient design makes the building stand out from the rest of the district; the entrance is guarded by massive marble pillars that manage to not clash with the metallic sheen of the rest of the structures nearby. The interior is similarly lavish, with a sprawling lobby area peppered with reception areas and centered by a massive fountain.`

The entire building seems to be as impressively decorated as the lobby, with beautiful furnishings and fine art. After some time, you finally arrive at Ivan's office. You thank the escort for bringing you here, as you surely would have been lost for hours without him, and knock on Ivan's door.`
			`	Ivan opens the door with a big smile on his face. "Captain <last>! So great to see you here. Please, have a seat." He ushers you inside his office, a large room with a window wall overseeing a scenic courtyard. You sit down in a plush chair on the opposite side of a desk, leaning back to get comfortable.

			`	"As far as wormholes go, we're still trying to theorize how the wormholes in this region of space work. A wormhole in the classical sense is some aberration in the fabric of spacetime that allows for instantaneous movement between two points. You can think of it like a tunnel, where you can go one way or the other. But how then does the series of wormholes that you discovered operate? Four different wormholes somehow create a loop of unidirectional travel." Ivan turns his chair and glances out at the courtyard. "We aren't yet sure how they could be functioning this way. Anything we come up with seems to violate some law of physics that we're certain is true."`
			`	Ivan turns back to you. "As for those alien creatures, they're similarly intriguing. Humanity has found life on other worlds before, but it has always conformed to our ideas of what life is, given our experience on Earth centuries ago. But these creatures are something else entirely. There are no terrestrial planets in the system you found them in which could be suitable for life, so they must have evolved on the gas giants. How life can even begin in such an environment, let alone evolve to be able to travel the vacuum of space - that is a mystery to us.`

Ivan pulls up a schematic on his computer of the Remnant ships that you scanned. You're somewhat surprised that he could pull so much information from an outfit scan. "The ships look relatively normal for the most part, but their hulls have an almost organic structure to them." He zooms in on a section of the schematic that highlights the hull structure. "Now, when it comes to ships designed by, say, Betelgeuse, or even the Navy, the hull supports are arranged in triangular or square sections. But these ships have a pseudo-hexagonal design to them, completely non-uniform. It almost looks like the cell structure of some plants.`
			`	"Aside from the strange hull structure, they also seem to have a considerable amount of equipment integrated directly into the ships themselves. Built-in scanners and ramscoops, for example. Stuff that didn't come up on the surface of the outfit scan but that we can tell is there. The smaller of the two ships you scanned also has some sort of built-in device that we can't make any sense of. It doesn't look like any sort of device that we've seen before, but it takes up a considerable portion of the ship's structure, so it must have some purpose. We'd need to get a closer look to figure out what it is."`

We already mentioned to you how they're rather powerful for their size, more so than even atomic engines of a similar size, while not producing very much heat at all. Their major downside, though, seems to be the immense amount of energy they draw. The energy drain is not surprising given that they seem to be improved ion engines, but the fact that ion engines could ever become more powerful for their size than atomic engines is something spectacular. The thrusters also seem to have the ability to provide reverse thrust, making any ship with them rather maneuverable."`

Somewhat interesting in that it doesn't produce much energy when compared to something like a fusion reactor, given the energy requirement of their engines, but I suppose these people are concerned more with keeping their ships running cool than with having extra power output. Another interesting characteristic we discovered is that the generator seemed to ameliorate the effects of ionization, like that which the Hai Ion Cannons apply, much better than normal. It seemed to be an intentional aspect of the generator's design."`

Two Inhibitor Cannons would take up about the same amount of space as a single Particle Cannon, yet the Inhibitor Cannons would deal more damage. On top of that, the projectiles of the Inhibitor Cannons have the strange ability to slow down any ship they hit. Ships that we tested them on were unable to turn and accelerate at their normal rates."`

There weren't very many ships or fleets that took shorter trips out of the cluster, say only one or two weeks in length. Seems they're sending people on rather lengthy missions.`
			`	"Aside from fleet movements, the number of ships was also of note. The cubes track the number of unique ships seen, and they rarely tracked the same ship more than a handful of times. The Remnant seem to have an incredible number of ships, more than perhaps Deep Security and the Navy combined. Certainly impressive for a group consisting of only three star systems. The cubes are also able to make low quality scans of any ships in the system. While each individual scan provides less than what an outfit scan would render, given enough scans, one can get a clearer picture of the ship's composition. These ship scan results were... interesting, though. There seemed to be very few ships like the ones you scanned. Perhaps those were their most advanced ships, but the rest of what I was able to see didn't seem more powerful than your average merchant ship."`

			`As the swirls of gas close over the <ship> you wonder idly what brought you back here. This time, there is no apologetic researcher asking you to risk your life for research, or to return eggs from where they were stolen. You catch a glimpse of the Archon materializing above the clouds as it decloaks, letting you know that you're being watched, but saying nothing; for now, it is nothing more than a silent, brooding presence in the skies of Nenia. The silent depths of an alien world fold over you, gradually erasing the rest of the galaxy from sight.`
			`	As the <ship> levels off at the designated altitude, you strap yourself into a pressure suit. Stepping into the airlock, you grimace at the antiquity of these "hard-shell" shield systems, and lower the shields so that you can exit onto the hull.

			`	Before long several void sprites emerge, weaving and dancing among the clouds. They swirl for a few minutes around your cargo bay doors as if waiting for something, then pulse briefly with flickers of light and drop into the clouds below. Another void sprite flutters around the <ship>, poking at the hull and sliding over it with its tentacles. You quickly think to turn on your video recorder to catch the scene. The void sprite notices your brief movement, and turns towards you with a lunge. As it closes on you, your attention is drawn to what you suspect is its mouth: a zig-zagging crack that peels open like a zipper to reveal an opening that resembles an industrial grinder.`
			`	Up close, the void sprite is massive. Most of its tentacles are easily as thick as your leg, and move with surprising speed and precision. It shifts through the air like a strange deep-sea fish in water. You can make out a low vibration you suspect is from the air whistling over the void sprite as it closes with you. As the giant creature rapidly approaches, you can feel a heavy paralysis weigh down on you. Suddenly, you recall that your shields are keyed to your equipment; you could activate them to protect yourself and they would extend around you.

In the same instant, the pressure on your mind vanishes as if it was simply a dream. You momentarily stare at the immobile void sprite, frozen in shock over what just happened. Then time reasserts itself and the sprite spasms away from the ship with an unearthly crescendo of dissonant tones. It plunges down into the clouds, leaving you standing on your hull with the floating severed piece of tendril.`

You can see that it is touching you, but you didn't even feel the impact. You and the void sprite stand frozen for a moment, and the force trying to paralyze you snaps off, replaced by a feeling of weightlessness. Moments later the void sprite pulls back and pulses skyward with an unearthly fountain of sounds, spiraling around the <ship> before disappearing into the swirling clouds.`

			`In the spaceport cafeteria, you spot the outfitter who asked you to retrieve a shipment of Hai keystones. He notices you and waves you over, gesturing at an empty chair opposite him.`
			`	"Greetings, <first>! I trust you are settling in among us?" he signs using simple gestures. "I picked up a rumor that you are learning our language, too." You sign the affirmative as you sit down. "Good, that is useful." He pauses, then continues, "I never introduced myself before. My name is Aeolus, and I help manage resource logistics for our fleets." He eyes you for a moment, then ventures, "You came in here with the appearance of looking for something.

				`	"What does 'outfits in the current' mean?"`
			`	"Oh, that's just an expression. 'Current' refers to a current of air or water as a metaphor for the development process. It means that there are outfits that are progressing in the development process." He taps at his commlink for a moment. "Back before the Exodus, there was a saying: 'products in the pipeline.' I think that has a comparable meaning to us having 'something in the current.' I am curious, though. Were you expecting me to sell them?"`

			`	Aeolus looks pleased at that. "You are correct. Finding something that does what the Quantum Key Stone does without being identical to it is clearly much more valuable as a subject of research than as a miscellaneous commodity. Add the security implications of slapping an alien device on a ship without thoroughly dismantling it, and the fact that we are not actually concerned with profit in the classical sense, and it is clear that they should not be simply dumped into the outfitting inventory."`
				goto clarification
			label "not for sale"
			`	He looks slightly embarrassed. "Sorry to disappoint you, but none of those outfits were ever going to be used in the form they came in, for several different reasons." He ticks them off on his fingers as he lists them. "First, security: slapping an alien device on every ship without having thoroughly dismantled them would be an invitation to getting tracked. Second, research: something that does what the Quantum Key Stone does without being identical to it? Definitely interesting to our researchers. And third, purpose."`
			`	He pauses to take a drink. "Unlike what you are probably used to from the outfitters you dealt with back in the ancestral worlds, my purpose is not to make money. Instead, I ensure that Remnant captains have the resources they need. What you see listed as the 'price,' Remnant captains see listed instead as a 'logistics adjustment' that indicates the amount of resources needed to supply that component. Every ship has a resource budget allocated to it, determining how much it can utilize for repairs, restocking, and improvements."`

Your shipment was definitely useful, but we had to ensure we framed your job in a way that made sense without revealing what we were actually doing.`

Whether it is ferrying cargo, building a structure, or protecting someone; everything we see says that humanity in ancestral space requires credits for everything it does. And then beyond that, the larger the amount of credits, the more enthusiastic they are to do it." Aeolus shakes his head, looking visibly perturbed. "This is what we see. Tell me, are we wrong?

Obviously, we cannot go take samples of Sagittarius A* itself, nor can we take direct measurements of most of its properties, but we can get data from increasingly minute distances from the event horizon.

We can trace every ripple on a pond in a storm and find its origin, but we have yet to learn the dance that we have lived in for half a millennia."`
			choice
				`	"What do the storms have to do with the heat?"`
				`	"What units do you use for temperature?"`
					goto "temperature units"
				`	"I think that is all the technical detail I can take."`
					goto "storm end"
			`	She looks mischievous. "I cannot tell you where or how we got it, but look at this." Her display shifts again with the hazes vanishing, and shows the galaxy map with one key difference. "Yes, the Ember Wastes are violet. Actually, they are off the visual spectrum into the ultraviolets, but this downshifts it so we can see it. This is what the Ember Wastes looked like a very long time ago."`
			`	She takes on a serious tone. "This data suggests there is enough energy in the area to maintain the hydrogen at somewhere in excess of 61A8 degrees. It does not tell us the source of that energy, but based on patterns and some other data we have collected, the two appear to be intertwined. At the very least, the ion storms are one of the means by which energy is being transferred into the clouds." Her display vanishes, and she slings her backpack over her shoulder.`
				goto "storm end"
			label "numeric system"
			`	She looks confused for a moment before responding. "It is called hexadecimal. It is a base 16 numeric system." She pauses to look at you. "Based on your reaction, I assume that base 10 is still the standard in human space?"`
			choice
				`	"Yes."`
					goto "storm continue"
				`	"How does that work?"`
			`	"Quite simply: We have added some extra characters. When counting, instead of a single digit position restarting at 0 every 10, they cycle every 16. So when we count, we start at 1, but when we reach 9, the next number will be A. Then B, C, D, E and F. Then, it is at that point that we add an extra digit and restart at 0 with 10. So in hexadecimal F would be equal to 15 in base 10. One of the advantages of using a numeric system with a higher base is that we can handle larger numbers with fewer digits. For example, with two digits we can communicate any integer up to what would be 255 in base 10. Or with three digits we can reach 4095. Saving an extra digit here or there is fairly meaningless in written formats, nor is it much of a difference in oral communication. However, when one communicates by gestures, it is helpful to shorten the numbers where we can."`
			label "storm continue"
			`	"Now that you understand our numbers a bit better, you will be able to recognize that there is a lot of unexplained energy being transferred out there."`
			choice
				`	"Right. Is that what causes the red glow?"`
					goto "storm resume"
				`	"Thanks! I think that is all the details I can handle right now."`
					goto "storm end"
			
			label "temperature units"
			`	She looks at you curiously. "Corrected degrees Kelvin, of course. Why?"`
			choice
				`	"What are 'Corrected degrees Kelvin'?"`
				`	"Just clarifying. I prefer to use degrees Centigrade."`
					goto centigrade
				`	"Just clarifying. I prefer to use degrees Fahrenheit."`
					goto fahrenheit
			`	"Corrected degrees Kelvin are basically the standard Kelvin scale developed millennia ago, but with a slight correction factor to account for the adjustments determined by the conjunction of 2730. It is a rather minuscule change to the scale that is mostly only applicable to experiments or industrial applications that require micro-degree temperature precision, but can be significant at the larger scales." The display and its field of stars vanishes as she slings her backpack over her shoulder.`
				goto "storm end"
			label centigrade
			`	"People still use that? We learned about it in our studies, mostly in case we came across references to it our library. I have seen it a few times, but it is rarely used among us." The display and its field of stars vanishes as she slings her backpack over her shoulder.`
				goto "storm end"
			label fahrenheit
			`	She looks at you quizzically for a moment, and then her display shifts to a mass of symbols. She skims briefly. "I have never even heard of such a unit. Apparently it is a very old one, though. Our records say that it had largely stopped being used by early in the 21st century. Well, I learned something new today." The display and its field of symbols vanishes as she slings her backpack over her shoulder.`
			label "storm end"
			`	"Thanks for the ride, Captain. I have to get working on this data, but if you are interested in helping some more, I hope to have more research expeditions planned soon."`

			`You step into the strange sight of the <origin> spaceport. The structures that surround the landing pads look as much grown as built, and they seem to merge into the landing pads themselves. As usual, the dock entrance is busy. When your commlink vibrates, you have to find a place where the traffic eddies so you can step aside. When you do, you learn you need to check in with the information desk.`
			`	The woman working the desk seems startled to see you when you walk up. You can see the realization dawn on her as she looks you over with a practiced eye. "Ah," she sings, "you are the ancestral sojourner among us."`
			`	It is typical for people to gawk at you, so you respond by singing, "I've been guided to friends I didn't know, and your message invited me to meet a new one."`
			`	Her hands make a short series of shakes and a moment later she remembers to laugh for you. The delayed response makes her laugh again, spontaneously this time, and you both join in. When she recovers herself, she sings, "Logistics have requested that we find someone who can carry <tons> of cargo to <planet>. Is the <ship> available immediately?"`
			choice
				`	"Certainly!"`
					goto "will do"
				`	"Sorry, it is not."`
					goto "not interested"
			label "will do"
			`	"Excellent," she responds in a full alto, "I will let the project manager know the cargo will arrive promptly." She signs what you think is a farewell and turns to address someone else who has stepped up.`
			`	You manage to chant and point your way through the cafeteria line, and you are aware of the flurry of signs around you. There doesn't seem to be a way to pay, so you find a table and sit alone until your commlink chimes to let you know that the <ship> has been refueled and the mystery cargo loaded.`

			`	"That is unfortunate," she sings as she makes a notation on her terminal. "But there will be others who are willing to help."`

		conversation
			`You step off the <ship> on <planet> to see a man wandering around your ship taking video with a datapad and softly dictating some running commentary. He dodges around the dock workers unloading and refueling, seemingly intent on recording every aspect of your ship.`
			`	"Cousin!" he sings with excitement when you walk up to him. "It is good to meet you and to see your wonderful ship. It excites me to be able to examine something I have only seen in entertainments based on our scouting reports." He holds up the datapad facing you and says, "I am making a video for my companion. He will not believe me unless I have proof, and maybe not even then!" he laughs. You wave at the camera and he stops recording.`
			`	"I hope I have not offended you. I get carried away looking at ships." He runs his hand along the landing strut but then seems to collect himself and turn back to you. "I am named Eon," he says. "Would you have time to talk about logistics support?"`
			choice
				`	"Yes, I've been looking for more work with the Remnant."`
				`	"Yes, there haven't been many opportunities so far."`
			`Eon leads you to the bustling cafeteria, chattering about ship design since the Alpha Wars. He orders a couple of hot drinks and leads you to a quiet table overlooking the docks. You try your drink. It's strongly flavored but a bit odd, like someone's memory of what coffee should taste like, reconstituted from local foods.`
			`	Eon leaves his untouched as he launches into conversation. "Those of us in logistics have noticed that you are spending time in our systems, and we wanted to see if you would be available to pick up work for us. It would be delivery work like the generator you brought for the housing project."`
			choice
				`	(Nod.)`
					goto delivery
				`	"You put starship radiothermals in your houses?"`
			`	"You do not?" he responds playfully. "Well, 'generators in each community' would be more accurate. We maintain a decentralized power grid so we have more resiliency in the event of an attack or natural disaster. It also makes use of the power plants we salvage from the Korath and ones we recover from our own damaged ships. Besides, widely deploying the technology ensures that we have expertise to maintain and repair it all across the Remnant. But," he signs a pushing motion, "civil engineering is another subject. I hope you are more interested in how we move our various cargoes."`
				goto delivery
			label delivery
			`	"That generator was originally scheduled for delivery 30 days from now, but it was ready earlier and the project can install it now. So, by bringing it over, you have enabled us to move the project forward and free up delivery capacity next month."`
			`	"So, why did you offer this work to me?" you ask, trying to mimic the gestures you've seen that you think refer to one's self.`
			`	He smiles and responds, "Very good! Very good! We schedule everything, but we maintain slack in the system to take advantage of opportunities like the power system being ready early, or to deal with emergencies. Sometimes, of course, we have to drop everything and sort the schedule out later. But, in normal times, we publish these jobs on the job board and captains that have capacity available can pick them up. The projects provide resource allocations to cover operating and crew costs, but there is no... what is the word? Margin, yes! Since your ship is not in our planned resources, you provide extra capacity, and we might be able to move some of our larger projects forward when you are in our space."`
			choice
				`	"Thanks for the opportunity."`
					goto thanks
				`	"Will your pilots be upset at the competition?"`
			`	Eon smiles at the question. "You should talk to the other pilots and see, but I think the ancestral approach is different. We work more like a military: the ships are owned by the Remnant, but each captain is responsible for the ship, the crew, and the transport work that needs to be done. I think they will be happy to see new homes being built, and freeing up more time for them and their crews to spend within the community."`
				goto thanks
			label thanks
			`	Before you can ask more about transport jobs, Eon takes out his commlink and taps on it for a few minutes. "You now have access to the logistics job board. You should be able to see our current job list for each system when you check."`
			`	You continue to chat with Eon as you sip your drink. When you finish, his commlink chirps. As he stands, he signs what you think means "goodbye" as he says he has to leave for another meeting. He walks off quickly with his head down looking at the datapad. Your commlink notifies you that <payment> have been added to your account.`
