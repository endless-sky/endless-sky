			`Although they are unusually tall and dark-skinned, the people here appear to be human. You wouldn't know it from the architecture, however: the buildings with their curved, twisted surfaces and ramifying arches look more alien than any human dwelling you have seen before.`
			`	Stranger still, no one is speaking: the usual background murmur of voices that you would associate with a spaceport is absent here. Instead, the locals are communicating in a rapid and graceful sign language, their hands tracing arcs through the air almost faster than your eyes can follow.`
			`	A few of them approach your ship and one of them greets you out loud, but instead of speaking he sings the words in a high, monotone chant: "Do you comprehend the ancestral tongue?"`
			choice
				`	(Say, "Yes, I do.")`

					goto chant

			`	Their expressions are inscrutable; you aren't sure if they even understood you or not. They turn away from you for a second and converse in sign language.`
				goto blood

			`	You sing, "Yes, I do," trying to match the leader's pitch. As you do so, several of them hum notes that harmonize with you.`
			label blood
			`	Two of them walk up to you. One is carrying a small device that looks like a handheld scanner. The other unwraps a small foil package, pulls out a lancet, and jabs his finger with it. A dark, red drop of blood wells up. He presses his finger onto a port on the scanner, then hands you another one of the packets. "We kindly request that you identify yourself," he chants. Several of the others hum along with him.`
			choice
				`	(Give them a blood sample.)`
					goto yes

					goto no
				`	(Run back to my ship and escape from here.)`

			`	You run into your airlock, slam the door shut, and blast off from the planet. Already, several of their ships are moving to intercept you. It seems that you are no longer welcome in this region of space...`
				launch

			label no
			`	You try to pull away, but the man's hand snakes out and grabs you by the wrist. Before you are even able to react he jabs your finger and shoves it onto the scanner. "You are in our space," he sings. "You will abide by our rules." No longer a monotone, his song is a jarring and atonal melody.`
			label yes
			`	Several of them gather around the one with the scanner as if waiting to see what the results will be. As you watch them you notice that all of them, even the women, have their hair cropped short. Also, their clothing looks like nothing that has ever been in fashion at any point in human history that you know of.`
			`	Finally the scanner beeps, and a yellow light flashes. You can almost feel the tension leaving the air as the crowd relaxes. "So you are pure. You are human," chants one of the women. "You are one of us."`
			choice
				`	"Of course I'm human. But what are human beings doing out here?"`
				`	"Who are you?"`

			`	Several of them burst into song, singing together in harmony, "We are the hidden ones. We are the Remnant. In time of great chaos to this place we came, lest all true-born humans be killed or enslaved, by those who evolved not, but unwisely were made."`
			`	As they continue to sing, you begin to piece together their story. They are the descendants of people who fled to this region of space through an unstable wormhole at the peak of the first Alpha War, which means they have been here for more than half a millennium. That doesn't explain why their culture is so radically different, though.`
			`	Eventually they invite you to a dinner. Their food has strange and complex flavors, not all of them pleasant, but you do your best to be polite and pretend to enjoy it all. The meal itself is generous and stretches out as your hosts consume considerably more food than you would expect for such a trim group. After the meal, they entertain you by singing songs, some of which you recognize as classical Earth music. It appears that people in this culture use sign language for day to day communication, and use their voices only for making music.`
			`	When you return to your ship, you do a search on videos of historical dialects of human sign language. None of them bear even a passing resemblance to the language of these people who call themselves the Remnant.`

"Now, insert your license here, and tap your pattern on the license." He looks away as you follow his directions.`
			`	"Done? Good. When we approach <planet>, you will have a few options: for a normal approach when everything is nominal, tap your pattern on the license. If there is a threat following you in - an enemy ship or some other kind of danger you want the monitors to watch for, pinch or squeeze the license instead. And if you have a problem onboard, such as having been captured and forced to fly the ship in, tap the license in a random pattern. Lastly, if you are having trouble landing due to injury or damage to the ship, just press briefly on the license. If you don't touch the license at all, the monitors will assume that you are either incapacitated or otherwise not in command of your ship. We will still attempt to let you land safely and provide assistance, but will also be standing ready to destroy you and block your approach if we think you are becoming a threat."`

			`	You proceed with the approach and landing, with the prefect pointing out noteworthy features along the way. He also points out various approach paths, including preferred routes to take if you are being chased. "If you have a hostile threat on your tail, take this landing corridor, which will expose trailing ships to fire from these points. And if you have something sticking tight in your shadow, do a roll at this point or that point. That will expose them to our high-precision batteries."`

Once the <ship> has settled safely to the ground, the prefect pulls the license from the socket and hands it back to you. "At the risk of sounding like a parody: keep it secret, keep it safe. May the Embers burn bright for you." And with that, the old prefect walks off your ship.`

So we implemented a policy where the first time a Remnant is granted formal access to a new planet their purity and identity is verified. Thus even if someone hacked our networks to give themselves a clean identity, they would still be caught when they started working on a new planet. We also don't broadcast that requirement on our networks, simply enforce it locally. It isn't foolproof, but it adds an additional layer of safety."`

			`	"Who is it?" Ivan says before peaking out the blinds. "Oh! Captain <last>! Please, come in."`
			`	Ivan opens the door and lets you inside. The office is cramped, the walls almost entirely obscured by filing cabinets. Ivan walks over to a desk that he barely has space to get behind, picking up a collection of papers and shoving them into the nearest cabinet. "Sorry about the mess," he says nervously. "I didn't know you were coming. Is there something I can help you with?"`

			`	"Oh, yes. We haven't been able to do too much with what funding we have left, but we have made one important discovery." Ivan turns to one of his filing cabinets and pulls out some sort of graphic that you would guess is depicting the anomaly, but you can't make any sense of it.`
			`	"One of our ideas has been that the anomaly is some sort of unstable wormhole. Reports of its existence go back to at least the times of the first Alpha War, with rumors that ships have left for Terminus to never return, presumably having entered the anomaly somehow. Now I'm not one to go off of rumors, but they certainly have to come from somewhere, so the idea was at least worth investigating.`
			`	"Going under the assumption that it is a wormhole that is simply too unstable to allow a ship to pass through, we wanted to see if we could get anything at all to pass through. What we've discovered is that given a small and smooth enough object, we can get it to disappear within the anomaly without a trace." He then pulls out a small metallic sphere about the size of a ping pong ball from one of the cabinets which he holds onto by a wire.`
			`	"Now this is only a model, but we created a number of small sensors about this size and sent them through the anomaly. We'd hoped that we could take some readings from whatever is on the other side of the anomaly, as it clearly goes somewhere, but we only ever get static coming back through the wire, followed by nothing a few minutes later. And unfortunately, whatever we send in we can't seem to pull back. The wire always snaps.`
			`	"So the anomaly is clearly a wormhole. Now we just need to figure out how to get whatever we send into it to come back, and how to get something the size of a ship to enter it."`

			`	The receptionist spends a few minutes tapping away at a keyboard. "Looks like he had his office moved to... the Deep Polytechnic Institute of Valhalla?" he says with a surprised look. "Damn, must have gotten someone's attention in the government to be moved there. Do you need directions?"`
			`	You get directions from the receptionist and thank him for his time. Turns out this Institute is in the heart of the university district of the spaceport city. Several planets in the Deep, Paradise Worlds, and even many near Earth have a similar university district, but the one on Valhalla is the largest of its kind in the entire Republic.`
			`	As you enter the district, you note that the architecture here is much more appealing than the brutalistic architecture of Ivan's old office building. The buildings consist of more curves than right angles with a textured metallic surface that scatters the sunlight to give the area a warm glow, as opposed to directing it right into your eyes if you happen to be standing in the wrong spot. Even among all the metallic buildings, there is still a good amount of greenery: well-trimmed bushes and trees line the streets, and many of the buildings are topped with gardens.`
			`	You ascend the stairs of the Institute, the massive building looming over you as you approach. Its more ancient design makes the building stand out from the rest of the district, the entrance being guarded by massive marble pillars that manage to not clash with the metallic sheen of the rest of the buildings. The interior is similarly impressive, with a massive lobby area centered by an impressive water fountain.`
			`	You approach one of the receptionist desks and ask to see Ivan Haataja. "It looks like he's available right now," she says. "We'll let him know you're coming and have someone here to escort you to Doctor Haataja's office shortly."`
			`	You're escorted through what seems like endless hallways and stairwells, the entire building being as impressively decorated as the lobby, before finally coming to Ivan's office. You thank the escort for bringing you here (as you would have been lost for hours without him, surely why they have people just for escorting guests) and knock on Ivan's door.`
			`	Ivan opens to door with a big smile on his face. "Captain <last>! So great to see you here. Please, have a seat." Ivan ushers you inside his office, an impressively large room with a window wall overseeing a beautiful courtyard. You sit down in a cushioned chair on the opposite side of a desk. You lean back into the chair and get comfortable. "I know the chairs are cozy," Ivan says. "Don't fall asleep on me though."`

			`	"As far as the wormholes go, we're still trying to theorize how the wormholes in this region of space work. A wormhole in the classical sense is some aberration in the fabric of space that allows for instantaneous movement between two points. You can think of it like a tunnel, where you can go one way or the other. But how then does the loop of wormholes that you discovered work? Four different wormholes creating a loop where travel is unidirectional." Ivan turns his chair and glances out at the courtyard. "We aren't yet sure how they could be functioning like this. Anything we come up with seems to violate some law of physics that we're certain is true."`
			`	Ivan turns back to you. "As for those alien creatures, they're similarly complexing. Humanity has found life on other worlds before, but it has always conformed to our ideas of what life is given our experience on Earth centuries ago. But these creatures are something else entirely. There are no terrestrial planets in the system you found them in suitable for life, so they must have evolved on the gas giants in the system. How life can even begin in such an environment, let alone evolve to be able to travel the vacuum of space, is a mystery to us.`

Ivan pulls up a schematic on his computer of the Remnant ships that you scanned. You're somewhat surprised that he could pull so much information from an outfit scan. "The ships look relatively normal for the most part, but their hulls have an almost organic structure to them." He zooms in on a section of the schematic that highlights the hull structure. "Now, when it comes to ships designed by, say, Betelgeuse, or even the Navy, the hull supports are arranged in triangular or square sections. But these ships have a pseudo-hexagonal design to them, completely non-uniform. It almost looks like the cell structure of some plants.`
			`	"Aside from the strange hull structure, they also seem to have a considerable amount of equipment integrated directly into the ships themselves. Built-in scanners and ramscoops, for example. Stuff that didn't come up on the surface of the outfit scan but that we can tell is there. The smaller of the two ships you scanned also has some sort of built-in device that we can't make any sense of. It doesn't look like any sort of device that we've seen before, but it takes up a considerable portion of the ship's structure, so it must have some purpose. We'd need to get a closer look to figure out what it is."`

We already mentioned to you how they're rather powerful for their size, more so than even atomic engines of a similar size, while not producing very much heat at all. Their major downside though seems to be the immense amount of energy they draw. The energy drain is not surprising given that they seem to be improved ion engines, but the fact that ion engines could ever become more powerful for their size than atomic engines is something spectacular. The thrusters also seem to have the ability to provide reverse thrust, making any ship with them rather maneuverable."`

Somewhat interesting that it doesn't produce much energy when compared to something like a fusion reactor given the energy requirement of their engines, but I suppose this people are concerned more with keeping their ships running cool then having excess energy. The one interesting characteristic we discovered though is that the generator seemed to handle the effects of ionization, like something the Hai ion cannons apply, much better than normal.

Two Inhibitor Cannons would take up about the same amount of space as a single Particle Cannon, yet the Inhibitor Cannons would deal more damage. On top of that, the projectiles of the Inhibitor Cannons have the strange ability to slow down any ship they hit. Ships that we tested them on were unable to turn and accelerate at their normal rates."`

There weren't very many ships or fleets that took short trips out of the cluster, say only one or two weeks in length. Seems like they're sending people on rather lengthy missions.`
			`	"Aside from fleet movements, the number of ships was of note. The cubes track the number of unique ships seen, and they rarely tracked the same ship more than a handful of times. The Remnant seem to have an incredible number of ships, more than perhaps Deep Security and the Navy combined. Certainly impressive for a group consisting of only three star systems. The cubes are also able to make low quality scans of any ships in the system. While those individual scans are less than what an outfit scan provides, given enough scans you're able to get a clearer picture. These ship scan results were... interesting, though. There seemed to be very few ships like the ones you scanned. Perhaps those were their most advanced ships, but the rest of what I was able to see didn't seem more powerful than your average merchant ship."`

			`As you enter the spaceport, you notice someone across the plaza appears to have been waiting for you. A tall, solidly built woman in short-sleeved coveralls stands up from where she was sitting near the information desk. With a few quick gestures at the person behind the counter, she heads towards you with a confident stride. As she approaches, you note that the crowds of people moving around the plaza seem to be staying out of her way as if she were someone important. In contrast, she reminds you of the mechanics who maintained the textile factories back on New Boston. In particular, the tools at her belt and the wear marks on her clothing suggest someone who is more comfortable inside a ship access duct than behind a desk.`
			`	Before you can decide if you want to avoid this person or not, she is standing in front of you, clearing her throat. "You are captain <first> <last> of the <ship>?" She asks in a lyrical chant.`

As she leans on the railing a cold breeze makes you shiver, but she seems oblivious to it. "I am known as Taely. As a prefect among the Remnant, I am responsible for this." She gestures at the shipyards, where you can see a myriad of the Remnant's alien-looking ships in various stages of construction or repair. "The ships we have serve us well, but they are old designs. Only the Gull is comparatively new. We need new ideas, new inspiration." She pauses, focusing briefly on a small bay where several people appear to be pulling what looks like a supercapacitor out of a Puffin.`

				`	"What are they doing?"`

Like salvaging an obsolete supercapacitor out of that Puffin so it can be reprocessed into something useful, and replacing it with newer integrated energy storage." She glances at you in amusement. "You've flown the Puffin, you know how old that ship is: primitive energy systems, antique 'hard-shell' shields that have to be manually raised and lowered..." She trails off into momentary silence. "Be glad that you got one that had already been refurbished prior to your visit to Nenia. At least it had modern engines and an updated sensor array."`

			`As the swirls of gas close over the <ship> you wonder idly what brought you back here. This time, there is no apologetic researcher asking you to risk your life for research, or to return eggs from where they were stolen. You catch a glimpse of the Archon materializing above the clouds as it decloaks, letting you know that you're being watched, but saying nothing; for now, it is nothing more than a silent, brooding presence in the skies of Nenia. The silent depths of an alien world fold over you, gradually erasing the rest of the galaxy from sight.`
			`	As the <ship> levels off at the designated altitude, you strap yourself into a pressure suit. Stepping into the airlock, you grimace at the antiquity of these "hard-shell" shield systems, and lower the shields so that you can exit onto the hull. Out on the surface, you admire the misty kaleidoscope of colors filtering down through the cloud layers, playing over distant shapes moving in the mists.`
			`	Before long several void sprites emerge, weaving and dancing among the clouds. They swirl for a few minutes around your cargo bay doors as if waiting for something, then pulse briefly with flickers of light and drop into the clouds below. Another void sprite flutters around the <ship>, poking at the hull and sliding over it with its tentacles. You quickly think to turn on your video recorder to catch the scene. The void sprite notices your brief movement, and turns towards you with a lunge. As it closes on you, your attention is drawn to what you suspect is its mouth: a zig-zagging crack that peels open like a zipper to reveal an opening that resembles an industrial grinder.`
			`	Up close, the void sprite is massive. Most of its tentacles are easily as thick as your leg, and move with surprising speed and precision. It shifts through the air like a strange deep-sea fish in water. You can make out a low vibration you suspect is from the air whistling over the void sprite as it closes with you. As the giant creature rapidly approaches, you can feel a heavy paralysis weigh down on you. Suddenly, you recall that your shields are keyed to your equipment; you could activate them to protect yourself and they would extend around you. It probably wouldn't be too healthy for the void sprite, though.`

The void sprite is just a few meters away, one tendril reaches out and touches you just as the shield slams into place. The tendril becomes caught on both sides of the shield, cleaving it in two. In the same instant, the pressure on your mind vanishes as if it was simply a dream. You momentarily stare at the immobile void sprite, frozen in shock over what just happened. Then time reasserts itself and the sprite spasms away from the ship with an unearthly crescendo of dissonant tones. It plunges down into the clouds, leaving you standing on your hull with the floating severed piece of tendril.`
			`	You carefully scoop up the tendril in a container and seal it. While the attack spoiled the beautiful moment, at least you have a sample and some recordings that might be of interest to Plume.`

			`	The feeling of paralysis leaves your body as the void sprite is only a few meters away, but you resolve yourself to face down the creature without triggering your shields. Time seems to slow down as the sprite rushes up to you and its leading tentacle reaches out to touch you. As you brace for an impact you realize that the sprite has managed to bring itself to a complete stop and the tentacle has telescoped in on itself slightly. You can see that it is touching you, but you didn't even feel the impact. You and the void sprite stand frozen for a moment, and the force trying to paralyze you snaps off, replaced by a feeling of weightlessness. Moments later the void sprite pulls back and pulses skyward with an unearthly fountain of sounds, spiraling around the <ship> before disappearing into the swirling clouds.`
			`	As you re-enter the ship, you notice that your suit is covered in some kind of translucent slime. You scrape off as much as you can into a sealed container, but your pressure suit appears to be permanently stained an iridescent purplish color as a result.

You sign the affirmative as you sit down. "Good, that is useful." He pauses, then continues, "I never introduced myself before. My name is Aeolus, and I help manage resource logistics for our fleets." He eyes you for a moment, then ventures, "You came in here with the appearance of looking for something.

			`	"Oh, that's just an expression. 'Current' refers to a current of air or water as a metaphor for the development process. It means that there are outfits that are progressing in the development process." He taps at his commlink for a moment. "Back before the Exodus, there was a saying: 'products in the pipeline.' I think that has a comparable meaning to us having 'something in the current.' I am curious, though. Were you expecting me to sell them?"`

Finding something that does what the Quantum Key Stone does without being identical to it is clearly much more valuable as a subject of research than as a miscellaneous commodity. Add the security implications of slapping an alien device on a ship without thoroughly dismantling it, and the fact that we are not actually concerned with profit in the classical sense, and it is clear that they should not be simply dumped into the outfitting inventory."`
				goto clarification
			label notforsale
			`	He looks slightly embarrassed. "Sorry to disappoint you, but none of those outfits were ever going to be used in the form they came in, for several different reasons." He ticks them off on his fingers as he lists them. "First, security: slapping an alien device on every ship without having thoroughly dismantled them would be an invitation to getting tracked. Second, research: something that does what the Quantum Key Stone does without being identical to it? Definitely interesting to our researchers. And third, purpose."`
			`	He pauses to take a drink. "Unlike what you are probably used to from the outfitters you dealt with back in the ancestral worlds, my purpose is not to make money. Instead, I ensure that Remnant captains have the resources they need. What you see listed as the 'price,' Remnant captains see listed instead as a 'logistics adjustment' that indicates the amount of resources needed to supply that component. Every ship has a resource budget allocated to it, determining how much it can utilize for repairs, restocking, and improvements."`

			`	"While the Remnant have an all-encompassing hierarchy to ensure everyone answers to someone, we saw fit to keep all facets of our society merged to prevent fragmentation into 'civilian' or 'military' branches. Two aspects of this merging is the decision of when to invoke military force and what amount of force is worthwhile. According to my position as a researcher, I have the authority to designate something a threat to my projects or to the Remnant as a whole. I could even order someone to act on it. However, given that I am of low status in terms of military proficiency, I cannot dictate the magnitude of the military response, and I am subject to being overruled by those with higher military qualifications."`
			`	"In our particular situation, I have higher xenobiology qualifications than you, so I can dictate to you, and most other xenobiologists, for that matter, that protecting the void sprites is a priority. However, you are more skilled at combat and military matters than I am. Therefore it is your decision as to how important it is relative to other military tasks. Likewise, it is your decision as to what amount of force is required, tactics used, or other such military considerations."`
			`	"This is one of the aspects that set prefects apart: They are Remnant who have demonstrated excellence in their field, sound judgment across a variety of fields, and an affinity for balancing a multitude of demands on Remnant resources. Humility is also a requirement, as they must always recognize that while their particular combination of skills may be unique, there is always someone else who is better than them at any one thing. As such, prefects are the adjudicators in determining the priority of our various tasks and the leaders who keep the Remnant unified."`

				`	"I thought prefects were specialists."`
			`	"Well, they are and are not. Most prefects are assigned particular tasks that they are expected to devote themselves to. Often, this task relates to their area of expertise, but it is not always the case. Generally speaking, a prefect is considered to be the ultimate authority on tasks that they have been assigned to, but they are expected to take into account the suggestions from other prefects and the specialists in the fields relevant to the task.`

			`You follow the directions of the starport control and settle onto a pad next to the outfitter. You barely have a chance to finish your landing checks before a team of Remnant have a compact pod waiting on your loading ramp. Once you open the cargo bay doors, they pick it up and maneuver it inside. They start securing it to the ship while Dawn and one of the scientists approaches you.`
			`	"We have loaded the research laboratory onboard. The team will install it if they can find the space, but if they do not, it will be secured in the cargo bay," The Remnant scientist explains. "Before you depart, please verify that the laboratory is installed in the correct location. You know your ship better that we do, after all." She turns back to Dawn and makes a gesture of respect. "Embers guide your path, Seeker." With that, she strides away into the hive of activity that is the outfitting bays.`

Snapshots of the sky are good - that is what we will be collecting on this trip. But for watching the galaxy at large, other civilizations, and things of that ilk... Nothing is better than long-term observation." She looks lost in thought for a moment. "That is neither here nor there, however.`

			`	"Now that you have the research laboratory, you will need to locate a jump drive in order to reach Sagittarius A*." She pauses and checks her commlink. "If you do not already have one, you can salvage one from a Korath Raider. Our early warning system indicates that there are several incoming Korath fleets that should be here within the next day or two. Any one of them should have a jump drive you can take. Meet me in the starport once you have a jump drive."`

			`	She gestures towards the exit closest to your ship and heads off at a quick pace. Outside, she moves calmly through the hustle and bustle of the starport, stepping around quick-moving freight movers and camel wagons alike. Arriving at the <ship>, she turns and waits for you to catch up.`
			`	Just as you arrive and reach for the console to open the airlock, you sense a change in your surroundings. Looking around, you see that a group of Remnant gathered around the two of you, focused on Dawn. A young Remnant - scarcely more than a child - steps forward. "Thank you for your patience," he says, then steps back. An elderly Remnant steps forward. "Thank you for your curiosity," she says, then steps back. A middle-aged Remnant steps forward. "Go with our blessing, Seeker, and know that wherever you go, the Remnant go with you." She says it simply, but you feel the weight of tradition behind them. She turns to you. "And you, stranger who walks the stars... May the Embers guide your steps as you walk among us." She nods respectfully, then steps back.`
			`	As soon as the third steps back there is a flurry of movement as each of the Remnant present quickly step forward, give her a quick hug, and then scurry off into the starport. Before you process what is going on, all the Remnant gathered around you have vanished. You look at Dawn, and her expression is a mixture of awe and humility.`

				`	"They know you are coming back, right?"`
				`	"What was that about?"`
				`	"Alright, let's get going."`
					goto astralmoving
			`	"Well, what we are doing is dangerous. We will be crossing Korath territory, a wide expanse of uninhabited space, and then scanning a black hole. I have confidence that we will return, but nonetheless there is still a chance that we will die in the process.`
			`	"Long ago we, as a people, decided that we must face the fear of separation, unknown, and danger. One of the ways we do that is by holding these informal ceremonies. When one of us is going to depart on their first long-distance voyage into hostile territory, a group of Remnant gather to bid them farewell. It is a way to strengthen ourselves and remind each other of our connections."`
			choice
				`	"Thanks for the explanation."`
					goto astralmoving
				`	"Kind of like a funeral, with friends and family gathering to see you off?"`
			`	"Oh, no. I said my farewells to my friends and relatives before we left. Those who gathered to see me off today were more of a representation of Remnant society. I only recognized a few of them, but they took the time to come down to the <ship> to meet me before I left. They came to see me and wish me well, so that no matter what challenges I face, I will know that the Remnant remember me and appreciate what I am doing." Her gestures fade into contemplative stillness for a moment, then resume motion.`

			`As the jump drive's energy ripples fade away, the spectacular void that is Sagittarius A* takes shape before you. Compared to the vast darkness of space that you are accustomed to, reality here feels almost like a color negative: even with the automatic filtering in your windows, space is incredibly bright with the densely packed stars that provide a backdrop for its inky mass. The moment of awe is shattered by alarms warning of your impending doom as the <ship> begins to fall inwards towards the black hole. You quickly activate your repulsor engines, which, although vastly under-powered for dealing with the immense pull of a black hole, does provide a degree of protection so long as you maintain a safe distance from it.`
			`	After a few minutes of just absorbing the spectacle before you, Dawn pulls herself away from the cockpit windows and scurries down to the lab. Leaving you to your thoughts, she quickly has the lab set up and running a variety of recordings, tests, and observations. After a few hours of work, she reappears on the bridge.`
			`	"Things are proceeding smoothly, Captain. All the sensors are working nominally, and we are creating extensive archives of astronomical data as well. Another few hours, and we should have all the data we need."`
			choice
				`	"Good work. What kind of data are you recording?`
				`	"Sounds good. Just let me know when you are ready to leave."`
					goto astraldone
			`	She smiles, and replies. "It might be easier to ask what we are leaving out. The data we are collecting broadly falls into three sets: data on Sagittarius A* itself, data on its environment, and observations of the surrounding galaxy from here. Obviously, we cannot go take samples of Sagittarius A* itself, nor can we take direct measurements of most of its properties, but we can get data from increasingly minute distances from the event horizon. We can then add this data to that gathered by previous expeditions, note the differences, and use it in our modeling."`
			choice
				`	"So this is not the first expedition here?"`
				`	"Anything unusual in the data?"`
					goto astraldata
				`	"How much longer does the equipment need?"`
					goto astralfinish
			`	"No, this is the forty-third such expedition. Sagittarius A* was one of the first places our explorers sought to visit after we acquired jump drives, and we have been coming back regularly ever since. I know some of our reconnaissance pilots consider visiting here a pilgrimage of sorts. It is humbling to be here myself after reviewing so many data sets of past expeditions." She looks thoughtful, staring out the window at the the hub of the galaxy, as if her thoughts are jumping from idea to idea.`

			label astraldata
			`	"There are many oddities about this place. Every visit helps revise our physics models a little closer. But they also reveal problems." She frowns, her gestures taking on a curious tone. "For instance, you will note that your ramscoops are not picking up anything. According to standard astronomical theory, this system should be a veritable river of suitable material, and yet there is nothing. Not even the normal background trace amounts we find in deep space. We have visited other black holes, and they conform to the standard models in this respect. But not Sagittarius A*." She pauses, thinking about it for a moment.`
			choice
				`	"Is the equipment finished?"`
				`	"How much longer does the equipment need?"`
			label astralfinish 
			`	"The equipment will be finished shortly, Captain <first>. I just need to make a few observations, and then we will be able to depart. In the meantime, I would recommend against maintaining an active cloak or engaging any systems that consume fuel. For whatever reason, Sagittarius A* continues to be the one place that the stellar wind is utterly devoid of anything to collect as fuel."`
			`	"I will be going outside for a few minutes," Dawn declares. "I shall just be on the hull."`
			choice
				`	"Let me know when you are done."`
					goto astraldone
				`	"Would you mind if I came too?"`
			`	"Not at all, Captain. The view should be remarkable, and so long as we stay inside the shields, the radiation will not pose a problem." You quickly don your spacesuit and join Dawn outside on the hull. As promised, the view is indeed magnificent. Dawn signs occasionally, pointing out various features, and you appreciate that out here, sound would just be incongruous with the natural splendor.`

Gradually, the brilliant density of stars that make up the inner core faded into the ominous and yet comfortingly familiar red glow of the Ember Waste. Finally, you slide into the approach patterns of <planet>, quickly tapping out your code into the IFF system and watching as the protective gaze of the anti-air emplacements sweep the skies around you for shadowing craft.`

"Well, <first>, it has been a good trip." She taps at her commlink. "I have transferred our expedition's logistics allotment of <payment> to you. And in case you're wondering what to do with your research laboratory, you can keep it. We always need fresh data, and if you are interested, you can check up on places designated in the job board. While I handled the science on this expedition, if you keep it installed your ship systems will automatically hire a scientist to run it." She nods her head in respect to you. "Thank you, and may the Embers watch over you." She turns and heads off into the flows of people.`
