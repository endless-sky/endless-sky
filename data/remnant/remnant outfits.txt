	description `Nearly a century ago, a Remnant scout exploring space north of the Ember Waste came under fire from an alien fleet armed with weapons that interfered with the scout's engines. The story says that the Remnant captain calmly told her crew, "We aren't going home until we steal that weapon." That alien technology became the basis of the Inhibitor Cannon.`
	description `	Although the Remnant appreciated the original weapon, they were disappointed that it was too big to fit on most of their ships. Instead of letting their effort go to waste, they instead opted to put their newfound knowledge to use creating a weapon suitable for their more nimble craft. Thus, the Inhibitor is excellent at controlling engagement distances, keeping targets at range by both pushing them backward with the impact of each shot while also slowing their approach by interfering with their engines.`

	description `While cannons that can interfere with a ship's engines are useful in any situation, the Remnant quickly decided that it would be even more useful as a turret that their ships could use to impede those chasing after them. These small Inhibitor Turrets are typically found primarily on Pelicans trying to outrun opponents rather than defeat them.`
	description `Although these turrets are unremarkable in terms of performance, the comparatively recent perfection of a technique of installing the bulk of the weapon itself externally on the turret mount instead of under the base has resulted in a weapon that takes comparatively little outfit space. It does, however, still add quite a bit more to the mass of the ship.`

	description "	The ion resistance on all Remnant generators not only allows them to bounce back from ion storms more quickly, but also gives their ships a window of time when an ion storm starts where they are not affected, giving them a chance to escape before becoming debilitated by the storm."

While this risk is non-existent in Remnant ships due to their 'gills', which are effectively built-in ramscoops, some captains prefer to speed up the process by adding additional capacity. For the rare captain braving the area in non-Remnant ships, this ramscoop is not particularly powerful, but it allows a ship to explore without fear of getting stranded."

To enable this pursuit of knowledge, the Remnant designed this compact laboratory that is built onto the side of a cargo bay, mess hall, or other larger room. When the room isn't otherwise occupied, this module expands out to convert it into a fully fledged laboratory."
	description "	While planetbound scientists might consider it little more than a closet packed with scanners and equipment, to the Remnant it is a base of operations used to investigate alien and stellar phenomena on-site. For captains, having advanced equipment to support their sensor suites as well as a trained scientist to serve in their crew amount to a strong benefit."

	description "The Remnant live in an environment where the raw materials for fuel are relatively common on the winds of the nebula. As such, their ships incorporate significant built-in ramscoop technology, and while they are reluctant to waste fuel, they aren't afraid of using it when needed. Far more important is the ability for their ships to quickly and efficiently enter or exit combat as needed. At the end of the day, it is continued life that is paramount."
	description "	The Bellows-class afterburner embodies this philosophy by providing captains with a tool that allows them to make great leaps of acceleration, typically during evasive maneuvers or to catch up with a fleeing target. Due to their enormous fuel usage, only the most specialized of ships have enough fuel to use these for more than a few seconds at a time before completely running out of fuel."

These highly effective weapons are credited with helping the Remnant safeguard their refuges from ground-based threats during their early years."
