	description `Nearly a century ago, a Remnant scout exploring space north of the Ember Waste came under fire from an alien fleet armed with weapons that interfered with the scout's engines. The story says that the Remnant captain calmly told her crew, "We aren't going home until we steal that weapon." That alien technology became the basis of the Inhibitor Cannon.`

	description `While cannons that can interfere with a ship's engines are useful in any situation, the Remnant quickly decided that it would be even more useful as a turret that their ships could use to impede those chasing after them. These small Inhibitor Turrets are typically found primarily on Pelicans trying to outrun opponents rather than defeat them.`
	description `Although these turrets are unremarkable in terms of performance, the comparatively recent perfection of a technique of installing the bulk of the weapon itself externally on the turret mount instead of under the base has resulted in a weapon that takes comparatively little outfit space. It does, however, still add quite a bit more to the mass of the ship.`

In the process they discovered that by adding more energy to the projectiles they could do a lot more damage in exchange for shorter range, and the Thrasher Cannon was born."

As such, their ships incorporate significant built-in ramscoop technology, and while they are reluctant to waste fuel, they aren't afraid of using it when needed. Far more important is the ability for their ships to quickly and efficiently enter or exit combat as needed. At the end of the day, it is continued life that is paramount."
	description "	The Bellows-class afterburner embodies this philosophy by providing captains with a tool that allows them to make great leaps of acceleration, typically during evasive maneuvers or to catch up with a fleeing target. Due to their enormous fuel usage, only the most specialized of ships have enough fuel to use these for more than a few seconds at a time before completely running out of fuel."

	description "In contrast to most of the galaxy, the Ember Waste is comparatively dense with the raw elements necessary for the production of fuel. Driven by the ever present fear that war is about to return to their desolate corner, the Remnant combined reverse engineered Deep technology with alien technology to provide improved sources of fuel to power their systems. The resulting system isn't quite as efficient as the Deep's design, but its compact size makes it much easier to fit onto almost any ship."

	description "Driven by fear that their corner of the galaxy is becoming less and less secretive, the Remnant are leaping upon every opportunity to innovate, steal, or cobble together fuel systems of ever increasing capacity. Their latest creation builds upon what they learned from the catalytic ramscoops with new techniques learned from the Wanderer ramscoops. While the Wanderer ramscoop creates a big field to pull in available matter, the Remnant use a set of nine small ramscoops spread out over the periphery of the ship to effectively generate a larger mesh to catch material, which is then rerouted back to a central processing unit. Some Remnant engineers consider this system effectively a way to let their ships breath in space."
