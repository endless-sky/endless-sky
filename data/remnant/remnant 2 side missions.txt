				`	"Exciting as always."`

				`	"Taking a break to relax a bit."`
			`	She nods sympathetically. "Things have been a bit hectic lately, what with dimensional pockets and mysterious new aliens. I can understand wanting to slow down a bit. With the launch of two new ships in such a short time, I know I feel like I need to just relax a bit." She sighs "It makes me feel guilty, honestly. I have accomplished so much, and there are so many things to be grateful for. I even have more projects in development to focus on." She looks lost in thought for a moment.`

			`	"I have been reading through the history archive you brought back, and I came across a mention of Vail." She shakes her head in amusement. "The idea of an entire planet devoted to leisure activities seems so extravagant... Well, I am just really curious to see it. "Now, this is not a mission we are asking you to do, so I cannot offer any logistics compensation. I could, however, show you some of our history in exchange. Are you interested?"`

				`	"That sounds fun."`

			`	"Really? I noted a mention of that in the descriptions, and it looked challenging." Her commlink shifts to display a hologram of a hoverboarder executing a jump with an artistic poof of snow around them. "Anyway, I think this trip should be a good diversion for us both. I will meet you onboard the <ship> shortly."`

			`As you approach Vail your sensors light up with energy traces that it quickly identifies as part of the weather control network. From what you recall, many areas of the planet have been adjusted to have greater than usual snowfall. As you approach closer your nav system easily picks up the beacons designating the approach path, and before too long you connect to the automated approach control that shunts you into the appropriate route down to a landing pad on the outskirts of the main spaceport.`

			`	Looking outside the ship, you can see a multitude of tourist-oriented facilities overwhelming the normal spaceport functions. You can pick out a small sign off to the side that indicates professional commodity and banking facilities, but otherwise the area is dominated by businesses offering mountain touring, sports classes, and vehicle rentals. Next to you, Taely alternates between peering out at the signs and reading brochures on a new commlink. "Here, <first>. This one sounds more interested in providing a challenge and less pampering. What do you think?"`
			choice
				`	"Looks good to me."`
				`	"Alright, should be good."`

			`	The resort in question is a more exclusive facility, and thus is located away from the main train lines. You rent a hovercar from one of the rental companies and make the short trek out to the resort. The rest of the day is spent out on the slopes, where both you and Taely eventually develope sufficient skill to graduate from the easy runs up to the medium difficulty. You both fall repeatedly, but Taely's good humor is contagious as she takes the inevitable facefulls of snow good naturedly.`

			`	The resort in question is a more exclusive facility, and thus is located away from the main train lines. You rent a hovercar from one of the rental companies and make the short trek out to the resort. The rest of the day is spent out on the slopes, where you teach Taely the basics of hoverboarding. By the end of the day Taely has impressed you with her quick learning and you finish off with a few runs down some of the more challenging slopes. Taely spills a few times, but she takes her failures in good humor, and never seems to make the same mistake twice.`

			`	Heading back to the spaceport after a day of hoverboarding, Taely surprises you by pulling the hood open on the hovercar and spending almost an hour going over the internal systems before closing it up with a nod. "Well, that was interesting. The hovercar, I mean." She gestures at it with her commlink. "So many different manufacturers were involved in making this vehicle. Sometimes I wonder if humanity appreciates the luxury such diversity affords them." She looks thoughtful, then gestures toward the ship. "Well, <first>, I promised you a tour of a historic Remnant district. Caelian has perhaps the best example of one, so I would recommend we go there."`
