With the launch of two new ships in such a short time, I know I feel like I need to just relax a bit." She sighs. "It makes me feel guilty, honestly. I have accomplished so much, and there are so many things to be grateful for, but I even have more projects in development to focus on." She looks lost in thought for a moment.`

"The idea of an entire planet devoted to hoverboarding and leisure activities seems so extravagant... Well, I am curious to visit it. Now, this is not a mission we are asking you to do, so I cannot offer any logistics compensation. I could, however, show you some of our history in exchange. Are you interested?"`

			label vaillanding
			`	Looking outside the ship, you can see a multitude of tourist-oriented facilities overwhelming the normal spaceport functions. You can pick out a small sign off to the side that indicates professional commodity and banking facilities, but otherwise the area is dominated by businesses offering mountain touring, sports classes, and vehicle rentals. Next to you, Taely alternates between peering out at the signs and reading brochures on a new commlink. "Here, <first>. This one sounds more interested in providing a challenge and less pampering.

You rent a hovercar from one of the rental companies and make the short trek out to the resort. The rest of the day is spent out on the slopes, where both you and Taely eventually develop sufficient skill to graduate from the easy runs up to the medium difficulty. You both fall repeatedly, but Taely's good humor is contagious as she takes the inevitable facefuls of snow in stride.`

			`	The resort in question is a more exclusive facility, and is located away from the main train lines. You rent a hovercar from one of the rental companies and make the short trek out to the resort. The rest of the day is spent out on the slopes, where you teach Taely the basics of hoverboarding. By the end of the day Taely has impressed you with her quick learning and you finish off with a few runs down some of the more challenging slopes. Taely spills a few times, but she takes her failures in good humor, and never seems to make the same mistake twice.`
			label vailheadhome
			`	Heading back to the spaceport after a day of hoverboarding, Taely surprises you by pulling the hood open on the hovercar and spending almost an hour going over the internal systems before closing it up with a nod. "Well, that was interesting. The hovercar, I mean." She gestures at it with her commlink. "So many different manufacturers were involved in making this vehicle. Sometimes I wonder if humanity appreciates the luxury such diversity affords them." She looks thoughtful, then gestures toward the ship. "Well, <first>, I promised you a tour of a historic Remnant district. Caelian has perhaps the best example of one, so I would recommend we go there."`
	on complete
		conversation
			`Taely directs you to a landing pad on the outskirts of the main spaceport, in an area that seems mostly filled with Gulls and Pelicans shifting larger quantities of products. Disembaring from the <ship>, she leads you down a large series of escalators that branch off in several directions, occasionally connecting with large ramps filled with steady stream of cargo traffic. After a few minutes they deposit you on a large platform.`
			`	Approaching the edge of the platform, Taely puts out her arm to stop you from advancing any farther. "Watch out for the barrier," she says as she puts a hand out and touches something in mid-air in front of you. As she leans on it you can see faint ripples around her hand. "They are an essential safety feature, but they can still hurt if you run into them." She gestures to easily recognizable hazard markings on the floor. "With time you will learn to notice the faint shield ripples in the air, but meanwhile, just remember that anywhere that has the 'stand-back' lines on the floor likely has shields above it most of the time."`
			`	Moments later, you see why the barriers are in place as a large train whooshes into the station at high speed before quickly coming to a stop. The barrier vanishes, and Taely leads you onto the train. Looking up and down the length of it, you can see hundreds, maybe even thousands of Remnant entering and exiting the train. Within moments the doors close, and the train starts moving again as you are pressed back into your seat. You see a few lights flicker past outside the window, but soon there is nothing outside but a monotonous dark blur.`
			`	Taely notices your gaze. "Sorry, but there will not be much to see out there. The entire train line is quite far underground. Far enough to simply pass under terrain obstacles like rivers, valleys, or chasms." She nods to herself in satisfaction. "This will not be a long trip: we will only spend a few minutes at top speed before we start decelerating near our destination. I would recommend buckling into the harness."`
			choice
				`	"I am looking forward to seeing where we are going."`
					goto ourdestination
				`	"How fast does this go?"`
			`	"The C3-L0 Maglev has a maximum rated velocity of 11D.E8 meters per second, and can sustain that almost indefinitely so long as the track remains powered. In practice, it rarely maintains that velocity for more than a few minutes at a time, as it is a local transport train. We do have some that go faster, but the amount of acceleration required to make use of them on short tracks is not terribly practical." She looks wistful. "Many people are working on solving the inertia problem, but Embers only know when that will result in something practical."`
			choice
				`	"Interesting. How long until we arrive?"`
					goto ourdestination
				`	"That number seems familiar."`
				`	"That sounds like the speed of light."`
			`	Taely smiles. "After all the safety factors, margins for error, and assorted other adjustments were taken into account, someone noticed that the rated value was a fraction of a meter per second above the coefficient of c, so they adjusted it down slightly so that the rated maximum velocity would match the coefficient of the speed of light in a vacuum.`
			choice
				`	"Thanks for the explanation."`
					goto ourdestination
				`	"What is a coefficient?"`
			`	She pulls up a hologram with c=11'DE7'84A m/s on it. "Here, I will switch to base 10 to make it easier for you to understand." As she speaks, the number 299'792'458 m/s appears on the screen, and then changes to 2.99792458x10^8 m/s. "When we write out a number such as the speed of light, it is typical to break it into parts. This is generally referred to as scientific notation. This is done to facilitate comparing and working with large numbers. The first part, 2.99792458 in this case, would be called the coefficient. The second part, x10, specifies the base; and the third part, ^8 is the exponent." The display shifts again to show 'c=1.1DE784Ax16^7 m/s'. "So this would be how we typically write the speed of light when we are using it in our research." She pauses, then vanishes the display. "We will be arriving momentarily, so I should probably stop there."`
			label ourdestination
			`	After several minutes, the lights in the train car suddenly pulse several times, and the train starts to decelerate heavily. You can feel yourself pushing into the harness as the train slows and comes to a stop. Unbuckling, Taely leads you out onto the platform, and then up a long escalator to the surface. Emerging into the sunlight, you find yourself looking around at a scene that seems almost anachronistic.`
			scene "scene/remnant remote spaceport"
			`	Taely looks around with pride, and then watches your reaction with amusement.`
			choice
				`	"I do not know what to make of this."`
				`	"This is a spaceport?"`
			`	She nods, and guides you amongst the stream of camel-drawn hovercarts heading for the gate. "This is one of our earliest spaceports, before we learned new techniques better suited to our new home. Our founding ships brought as much as they could, of course, but as it turns out, the earliest phases of expansion look much the same, whether one is looking at historic pre-flight eras or modern settlement efforts."`

			scene "scene/remnant remote spaceport"
			`	Taely picks up a board from a nearby pile. "We were fortunate that Caelian had some vegetation that could be used like this. The native vegetation is biologically quite different from the trees of Earth, but they have similar structural characteristics and grow plentifully in many areas." She offers you the board. "The decision was made early on that anything that could be made from locally sourced materials, should be sourced locally. We wanted to conserve our limited supplies of metals and other rare resources for things that required it." She taps on a barrel. "These are a prime example - a few metal straps enable the wood to hold a significant amount of liquid. It is much the same as how a comparatively small amount of bone in our bodies can provide the necessary structure for a large volume of soft tissues and organs to function."`
				goto questionloop
			label camelcart
			scene "scene/remnant remote spaceport"
			`	"Is that so? The engineering advantages are quite simple: with the mechanics of the cart focused entirely on supporting the load and the camel providing horizontal motion, the cart can support much larger masses than it could if it had to split the forces." She looks wistful. "In truth, I am somewhat envious of the industrial capacity the ancestral worlds contain - we have accomplished much, but we have had to make choices, and one of those was the decision as to where to spend our industrial capacity. We chose, obviously, to focus on spacecraft and heavy industrial applications. We have no cars, no personal vehicles at all, really. Even these hovercarts are basically the repulsor systems from our spacecraft that have been repurposed to carry massive loads."`
			`	Taely gestures out through the gate at the distant landscape. "It is ironic that, in many respects, the distant stars are more accessible to us than the metaphorical far side of the mountain. Those of us who explore our worlds often resort to long expeditions with camel trains to carry all their scientific equipment. Spending months away from friends or family while on a project is commonplace, even for those who never leave the surface of our planets. Many of our explorers, in fact, live nomadic lifestyles - moving every couple of weeks to a new research location as they study, document, and analyze the world." Her gestures take on a reverent tone. "Many of our most important discoveries can be attributed to these explorers."`
			`	Her tone shifts to one of amusement. "We were lucky, though. Our camels were able to sustain themselves on several categories of local vegetation right from the start. It took quite a bit of experimentation with bacterial cultures, however, before we were able to enable them to really forage properly. Now they thrive here. Some experts suspect that, if we were to ever leave, the camels would probably continue to survive here for millennia to come.`
				goto questionloop
			label stonewalls
			scene "scene/remnant remote spaceport"
			`	Taely's expression becomes mournful as she leads you over to the walls. "We discovered soon after we arrived here that this planet was not as safe as it appeared. It had a variety of natural predators, including swarms of predatory creatures that were very aggressive in hunting us. They preferred darkness, and while they had excellent eyesight, their hearing was even sharper. A swarm could triangulate the position of a person from a single spoken word at great distances."`
			`	She gestures up at the edge of the wall. "Fortunately, we discovered that while they were quite competent climbers, they could not navigate overhangs. So while such lips are generally considered a structural vulnerability when defending against modern weapons, they are indispensable for containing local wildlife. These walls served as well later on, too, when we had to deal with Korath ground attacks and other more complex threats."`
				goto questionloop
			label windturbine
			scene "scene/remnant remote spaceport"
			`	"They are indeed wind turbines." She steps through the gate to a spot with a better view. You can see that while the ones on the wall are are only a couple of meters tall, the ones on top of the towers are significantly bigger. "Our ancestors rightly guessed that anywhere that had sufficient atmosphere to dispense with pressure suits would also have wind. The vertical style also has the advantage that it handles high wind speeds and rapid variation in direction much better than some of the shapes that were more traditional at the time of the exodus. It seems to be a good precaution, as it has enabled these to survive the harsh windstorms that can sweep across the continent. While they have been repaired and improved over the centuries, these wind turbines still provide sufficient power for much of the agricultural uses out here, so we let them continue. They are also useful to remind us from where we have come."`
				goto questionloop
			label mainreturn
			`	Taely leads you around the area for a few more hours, pointing out historical features, places where they resurrected trades and skills from before the advent of flight, and other interesting things. Eventually she heads back to the train station, which deposits you back in the main spaceport.`
			`	"I hope you enjoyed the tour, <first>. It was interesting to see our history through fresh eyes." She smiles micheviously. "And I enjoyed the hoverboarding, too. Maybe we can do it again sometime." She pauses for a moment, focusing on something you cannot see. "Looks like duty calls. Embers guide your way, Captain <last>." She waves, and heads off into the crowd.`

"It is lacking the confirmation codes or identification info, but I am confident that this is it." Ruach says as you approach.`
			`	"Sorry for leaving you behind, this is just such an exciting discovery. This ship you have found matches the profile of the Shattered Light - a large city ship that was part of the exodus but never arrived on this side of the wormhole. There are so many questions here!

"I would just like to start by offering our thanks for your assistance, Captain <first>. You have sharp eyes to pick this up as early as you did. Other scouts reported it shortly thereafter, but you spotted it first." She gestures to the hologram of the ship floating in front of you.`
			`	"We have confirmed that this matches all available records of the Shattered Light, although it appears to have suffered considerable damage. One of the many mysteries here is what has happened to it, and what we should do about it."`
			`	Another Remnant steps forward and the hologram changes to show a scene from a cave with a large object. Other Remnant appear to aim some equipment at it, and after a moment or two, the object expands to several times its original size. "These are recordings from our explorations of the ruins, demonstrating the decompression of a Maudrakoi artifact. While not identical, these artifacts generate similar readings to those recorded during your scan of the Shattered Light.`
			`	"As such, we are proposing that we use the same equipment we use for decompression to stabilize the Shattered Light's weft field, and, if possible, bring it fully into synchronity once again." She nods firmly, clapping her hands together to make the hologram vanish.`
			`	Ruach takes the lead again. "So, Captain, we will need you to bring us in close to the Shattered Light so we can give this a try. Our sentries have reported seeing it in the systems near Coluber, so it may take some searching."`

				`	"Wait, 'Maudrakoi'?"`
			`	The Remnant who showed the video looks startled, and then embarrassed. "My apologies, I did not realize you had not been familiarized with them." They look around the room, then gesture and their hologram shifts to show a large room with many shelves around the edge and several large objects within it, including some that look like point defense turrets.`
			`	"We do not have time for an in-depth presentation; but the short version is this: The Maudrakoi are the primary civilization that live on these worlds before we arrived. They are not the only civilization to have lived here, but they are the one we find most often in the archeological record. Fortunately for our research, it seems that they lived extensively underground in complexes such as this one."`
			`	Her gestures take on an appreciative tone. "The Maudrakoi made extensive use of the materials that make our ships and architecture so distinctive, and this has allowed their cities and technologies to survive the eons since they went extinct. One technology of note is they had an interesting ability to manipulate space. They used this to make large, highly complex objects, and then, for lack of a better term, partially embed them in pocket dimensions so as to not be entirely present. They used this frequently to allow equipment and materials to be much smaller than normal." She shrugs, and gestures with a frustrated tone. "We cannot replicate it, but we have figured out how to disrupt the compression, and thus recover the artifact."`
			`	The hologram shifts back to showing the Shattered Light. "This ship does not show the same signatures as the Maudrakoi artifacts, but we think it is sufficiently similar that our equipment should be able to work on it too. Hopefully. In any case, though, time is passing, so we should start loading." With that, the Remnant gather their equipment and head out.`

A message appears on your console.`
			`	"Ready for drop, Captain. Just get us along side the Shattered Light without too much forward velocity, we can handle the rest."`
			`	Moments later your ship pings a point on the ship indicating a gaping hole on the ship. Nodding your assent, the <ship> swoops to a hold position just above it. A glance at your cargo hold display shows the Remnant vanishing out the back lock.  Your exterior cameras show the equipment falling into it on repulsor pallets while the Remnant drop alongside it.

			`Eventually you find a good vantage point several kilometers away where you can watch the approaching ship. The Shattered Light falls through the sky with deceptive slowness, made all the worse for the fact that you can see clouds and sky passing through it. As it nears the surface you see a ripple in the air explode out from it, followed by a concussive shockwave as the Shattered Light suddenly becomes very solid. Its engines flare to life with a roar that rattles your bones and the ship lurches to a stop in mid-air, before crunching down into the forest.`
			`	The dust and debris settles within a few minutes, and soon you and the <ship> are skimming over the vegetation. The approach gives you ample time to appreciate just how massive the Shattered Light is. Literally everything that one could need to lay the foundations for a new colony, packed into a single ship. You note large gashes in the hull, along with massive sensor arrays and a shattered dome on top. Based on the mismatch of parts, this ship has been substantially modified from its original hull, and survived untold damage.`
			`	As you slow to a hover alongside, Ruach appears on your viewscreen. "Well met, Captain! Our theory worked! We managed to snap the Shattered Light back into the primary weft, and are now onboard.

			`	The Shattered Light is so big that traffic control directs the two of you to a large valley next to the spaceport, where you discover that a section of chasm has been covered to create a semi-enclosed area. Judging from the equipment and stacks of freight, this area looks like it is predominantly used by bulk freight shipments and little else. Now, however, as the Shattered Light slowly moves in, a flock of Pelicans scatter in front of it looking like nothing more than a flock of plovers in front of an approaching camel.`
			`	Down on the ground, you see Ruach and her team exit an airlock on the side of the Shattered Light and jump down to the ground. They gather around, giving hugs. "<first>!" exclaims Ruach.

			`	The team of Remnant are almost too excited for you to understand their gestures, but one calms down enough that their gestures are comprehensible. "To be honest, we were expecting this to be the first of several trips doing detailed scans and trying out different sorts of synchronization fields. But when we saw that it was heading to the planet..." She trails off, and another one continues. "We already had the sensors running as we approached, so we jumped and triggered the fields as soon as we got a reasonable match."`
			`	He frowns a bit "It worked, although not perfectly. There are chunks missing, some of which seriously impair its functionality. But it is back in the primary weft, so now we have time to work on it and figure out what happened to it.`

				`	"What is this 'Primary Weft' you have mentioned?"`
			`	Another Remnant steps forward. "The Weft is what we term the mesh of dimensions, energy, and time that form a subset of the universe. A layer, of sorts." He looks thoughtful. "What you probably know as 'Hyperspace' is what we technically call the secondary weft. There are a few others we are fairly confident exist, and several that we have hypothesized might exist but we have no means of confirming. Practically, each of these overlaps with the primary weft to some extent." His gestures take on an amused tone. "Of course, what we call the Primary Weft is only primary to those of us who live here. For all we know, there may be people living elsewhere that consider their own weft to be the primary one. Nothing says ours is special or the best or anything of the sort."`

			`	"Before you leave, though, there was some stuff that survived intact we would like to share with you." Behind her five androids emerge from one of the cargo hold, each one carrying a large trunk of equipment. "These are known as NDR-114 Androids, and were cutting edge innovations back when the exodus occurred. Don't expect too much of them: They are not self-aware, sentient, or even particularly advanced artificial intelligence. They are, however, excellent extensions of a ship's self-maintenance systems. As it turns out, a large number of these androids were instrumental in keeping the Shattered Light flying all these years. We have plenty to study, we thought you might appreciate having a few."`

			`	"We have had the opportunity to start querying the onboard systems and piece together a little of the Shattered Light's history. As we all know, it was part of the exodus fleet that entered the Terminus wormhole. Unlike most of the other ships, however, it never emerged from the other side. Fortunately, it had a significantly larger array of instruments than was normal for ships of its type, and it looks like at least some of the databanks survived."`
			`	At this point another Remnant takes up the narrative. "Based on the initial incident logs, it appears that something in the stabilization fields failed during transit. The data is not clear whether the systems failed, or if something in the wormhole fluctuations exceeded the parameters that the systems could handle. In any case, the ship appears to have been shunted laterally from the wormhole in mid-transit.`
			`	"It is unclear what happened after that, but the ship was subject to significant forces including unidentified impacts that caused multiple system failures. The data loses some coherence at this point, but it basically seems to have been semi-permanently stuck out-of-phase with prime weft until an energy surge destabilized it and it wobbled back into prime coherence. At that point, it started being visible again, and shortly after you spotted it."`

				`	"I am curious as to what will you do now."`
			`	"The first step will be to unpack the Shattered Light and setup all its equipment. Taking detailed scans of each piece as we do so, of course." One of the other Remnant continues when Ruach pauses. "The Shattered Light carried what amounts to an entire heavy industrial factory. Everything from smelters to welding equipment and everything in between." They smile and their gestures take on a tone of irony. "In fact, the ships we have now are in no small part due to the Shattered Light's absence. Without these capabilities, the the choice about whether or not to commit to learning the techniques of those who lived here before us was much easier."`

			`	Taely gestures take a tone of curiosity. "One thing that you could help us with, if you wish, is resources. Right now we do not have any real need to put all this machinery to work; and as such we do not have the resources to spare for it. That being said, if ever you would like a replica of the Shattered Light, we could use this equipment to build one."`
			`	Her gestures take on an apologetic tone. "It will not be a perfect replica as we will have to use our own systems for most of the internals, and the resource allotment cost will be significantly higher than it would have been back at Tycho crater... But if you have the resources and interest, the opportunity is there... The shipyard will have more information for you." Her gestures trail off with a sign that indicates vast possibilities.`
