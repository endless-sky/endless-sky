			`	She nods sympathetically. "Things have been a bit hectic lately, what with dimensional pockets and mysterious new aliens. I can understand wanting to slow down a bit. With the launch of two new ships in such a short time, I know I feel like I need to just relax a bit." She sighs. "It makes me feel guilty, honestly. I have accomplished so much, and there are so many things to be grateful for, but I even have more projects in development to focus on." She looks lost in thought for a moment.`

"The idea of an entire planet devoted to hoverboarding and leisure activities seems so extravagant... Well, I am curious to visit it. Now, this is not a mission we are asking you to do, so I cannot offer any logistics compensation. I could, however, show you some of our history in exchange. Are you interested?"`

			label vaillanding
			`	Looking outside the ship, you can see a multitude of tourist-oriented facilities overwhelming the normal spaceport functions. You can pick out a small sign off to the side that indicates professional commodity and banking facilities, but otherwise the area is dominated by businesses offering mountain touring, sports classes, and vehicle rentals. Next to you, Taely alternates between peering out at the signs and reading brochures on a new commlink. "Here, <first>. This one sounds more interested in providing a challenge and less pampering.

			`	The resort in question is a more exclusive facility, and is located away from the main train lines. You rent a hovercar from one of the rental companies and make the short trek out to the resort. The rest of the day is spent out on the slopes, where both you and Taely eventually develop sufficient skill to graduate from the easy runs up to the medium difficulty. You both fall repeatedly, but Taely's good humor is contagious as she takes the inevitable facefuls of snow in stride.`

			`	The resort in question is a more exclusive facility, and is located away from the main train lines. You rent a hovercar from one of the rental companies and make the short trek out to the resort. The rest of the day is spent out on the slopes, where you teach Taely the basics of hoverboarding. By the end of the day Taely has impressed you with her quick learning and you finish off with a few runs down some of the more challenging slopes. Taely spills a few times, but she takes her failures in good humor, and never seems to make the same mistake twice.`
			label vailheadhome
			`	Heading back to the spaceport after a day of hoverboarding, Taely surprises you by pulling the hood open on the hovercar and spending almost an hour going over the internal systems before closing it up with a nod. "Well, that was interesting. The hovercar, I mean." She gestures at it with her commlink. "So many different manufacturers were involved in making this vehicle. Sometimes I wonder if humanity appreciates the luxury such diversity affords them." She looks thoughtful, then gestures toward the ship. "Well, <first>, I promised you a tour of a historic Remnant district. Caelian has perhaps the best example of one, so I would recommend we go there."`
	on complete
		conversation
			`Taely directs you to a landing pad on the outskirts of the main spaceport, in an area that seems mostly filled with Gulls and Pelicans shifting larger quantities of products. Disembarking from the <ship>, she leads you down a large series of escalators that branch off in several directions, occasionally connecting with large ramps filled with steady stream of cargo traffic. After a few minutes they deposit you on a large platform.`
			`	Approaching the edge of the platform, Taely puts out her arm to stop you from advancing any farther. "Watch out for the barrier," she says as she puts a hand out and touches something in mid-air in front of you. As she leans on it you can see faint ripples around her hand. "They are an essential safety feature, but they can still hurt if you run into them." She gestures to easily recognizable hazard markings on the floor. "With time you will learn to notice the faint shield ripples in the air, but meanwhile, just remember that anywhere that has the 'stand-back' lines on the floor likely has shields above it most of the time."`
			`	Moments later, you see why the barriers are in place as a large train whooshes into the station at high speed before quickly coming to a stop. The barrier vanishes, and Taely leads you onto the train. Looking up and down the length of it, you can see hundreds, maybe even thousands of Remnant entering and exiting the train. Within moments the doors close, and the train starts moving again as you are pressed back into your seat. You see a few lights flicker past outside the window, but soon there is nothing outside but a monotonous dark blur.`
			`	Taely notices your gaze. "Sorry, but there will not be much to see out there. The entire train line is quite far underground. Far enough to simply pass under terrain obstacles like rivers, valleys, or chasms." She nods to herself in satisfaction. "This will not be a long trip: we will only spend a few minutes at top speed before we start decelerating near our destination. I would recommend buckling into the harness."`
			choice
				`	"I am looking forward to seeing where we are going."`
					goto ourdestination
				`	"How fast does this go?"`
			`	"The C3-L0 Maglev has a maximum rated velocity of 11D.E78 meters per second, and can sustain that almost indefinitely so long as the track remains powered. In practice, it rarely maintains that velocity for more than a few minutes at a time, as it is a local transport train. We do have some that go faster, but the amount of acceleration required to make use of them on short tracks is not terribly practical." She looks wistful. "Many people are working on solving the inertia problem, but Embers only know when that will result in something practical."`
			choice
				`	"Interesting. How long until we arrive?"`
					goto ourdestination
				`	"Why is that number so precise?"`
				`	"That sounds like the speed of light."`
			`	Taely smiles. "After all the safety factors, margins for error, and assorted other adjustments were taken into account, someone noticed that coefficient of the rated value was calculated to be 1.1DE79, a fraction above the coefficient of the speed of light in a vacuum, so they adjusted the rated maximum velocity down only slightly so that they would match."`
			choice
				`	"Thanks for the explanation."`
					goto ourdestination
				`	"What is a coefficient?"`
			`	"Here, I will switch to base 10 to make it easier for you to understand." She pulls up a hologram with 299,792,458 m/s on it. As she speaks, the number shifts to 2.99792458x10^8 m/s. "When we write out a number such as the speed of light, it is typical to break it into parts. This is generally referred to as scientific notation. This is done to facilitate comparing and working with large numbers. The first part, 2.99792458 in this case, would be called the coefficient. The second part, x10, specifies the base; and the third part, ^8 is the exponent." The display shifts again to show 1.1DE784Ax16^7 m/s. "So this would be how we typically write the speed of light when we are using it in our research. So, 1.1DE78 is the coefficient of both the speed of light and the speed of the train, just with a different exponent." She pauses, then vanishes the display. "We will be arriving momentarily, so I should probably stop there."`
			label ourdestination
			`	After several minutes, the lights in the train car suddenly pulse several times, and the train starts to decelerate heavily. You can feel yourself pushing into the harness as the train slows and comes to a stop. Unbuckling, Taely leads you out onto the platform, and then up a long escalator to the surface. Emerging into the sunlight, you find yourself looking around at a scene that seems almost anachronistic.`
			scene "scene/remnant remote spaceport"
			`	Taely looks around with pride, and then watches your reaction with amusement.`
			choice
				`	"I do not know what to make of this."`
				`	"This is a spaceport?"`
			`	She nods, and guides you amongst the stream of camel-drawn hovercarts heading for the gate. "This is one of our earliest spaceports, before we learned new techniques better suited to our new home. Our founding ships brought as much as they could, of course, but as it turns out, the earliest phases of expansion look much the same, whether one is looking at historic pre-flight eras or modern settlement efforts."`

			scene "scene/remnant remote spaceport"
			`	Taely picks up a board from a nearby pile. "We were fortunate that Caelian had some vegetation that could be used like this. The native vegetation is biologically quite different from the trees of Earth, but they have similar structural characteristics and grow plentifully in many areas." She offers you the board. "The decision was made early on that anything that could be made from locally sourced materials, should be sourced locally. We wanted to conserve our limited supplies of metals and other rare resources for things that required it." She taps on a barrel. "These are a prime example - a few metal straps enable the wood to hold a significant amount of liquid. It is much the same as how a comparatively small amount of bone in our bodies can provide the necessary structure for a large volume of soft tissues and organs to function."`
				goto questionloop
			label camelcart
			scene "scene/remnant remote spaceport"
			`	"Is that so? The engineering advantages are quite simple: with the mechanics of the cart focused entirely on supporting the load and the camel providing horizontal motion, the cart can support much larger masses than it could if it had to split the forces." She looks wistful. "In truth, I am somewhat envious of the industrial capacity the ancestral worlds contain - we have accomplished much, but we have had to make choices, and one of those was the decision as to where to spend our industrial capacity. We chose, obviously, to focus on spacecraft and heavy industrial applications. We have no cars, no personal vehicles at all, really. Even these hovercarts are basically the repulsor systems from our spacecraft that have been repurposed to carry massive loads."`
			`	Taely gestures out through the gate at the distant landscape. "It is ironic that, in many respects, the distant stars are more accessible to us than the metaphorical far side of the mountain. Those of us who explore our worlds often resort to long expeditions with camel trains to carry all their scientific equipment. Spending months away from friends or family while on a project is commonplace, even for those who never leave the surface of our planets. Many of our explorers, in fact, live nomadic lifestyles - moving every couple of weeks to a new research location as they study, document, and analyze the world." Her gestures take on a reverent tone. "Many of our most important discoveries can be attributed to these explorers."`
			`	Her tone shifts to one of amusement. "We were lucky, though. Our camels were able to sustain themselves on several categories of local vegetation right from the start. It took quite a bit of experimentation with bacterial cultures, however, before we were able to enable them to really forage properly. Now they thrive here. Some experts suspect that, if we were to ever leave, the camels would probably continue to survive here for millennia to come."`
				goto questionloop
			label stonewalls
			scene "scene/remnant remote spaceport"
			`	Taely's expression becomes mournful as she leads you over to the walls. "We discovered soon after we arrived here that this planet was not as safe as it appeared. It had a variety of natural predators, including swarms of predatory creatures that were very aggressive in hunting us. They preferred darkness, and while they had excellent eyesight, their hearing was even sharper. A swarm could triangulate the position of a person from a single spoken word at great distances."`
			`	She gestures up at the edge of the wall. "Fortunately, we discovered that while they were quite competent climbers, they could not navigate overhangs. So while such lips are generally considered a structural vulnerability when defending against modern weapons, they are indispensable for containing local wildlife. These walls served as well later on, too, when we had to deal with Korath ground attacks and other more complex threats."`
				goto questionloop
			label windturbine
			scene "scene/remnant remote spaceport"
			`	"They are indeed wind turbines." She steps through the gate to a spot with a better view. You can see that while the ones on the wall are only a couple of meters tall, the ones on top of the towers are significantly bigger. "Our ancestors rightly guessed that anywhere that had sufficient atmosphere to dispense with pressure suits would also have wind. The vertical style also has the advantage that it handles high wind speeds and rapid variation in direction much better than some of the shapes that were more traditional at the time of the exodus. It seems to be a good precaution, as it has enabled these to survive the harsh windstorms that can sweep across the continent. While they have been repaired and improved over the centuries, these wind turbines still provide sufficient power for much of the agricultural uses out here, so we let them continue. They are also useful to remind us from where we have come."`
				goto questionloop
			label mainreturn
			`	Taely leads you around the area for a few more hours, pointing out historical features, places where they resurrected trades and skills from before the advent of flight, and other interesting things. Eventually she heads back to the train station, which deposits you back in the main spaceport.`
			`	"I hope you enjoyed the tour, <first>. It was interesting to see our history through fresh eyes." She smiles mischievously. "And I enjoyed the hoverboarding, too. Maybe we can do it again sometime." She pauses for a moment, focusing on something you cannot see. "Looks like duty calls. Embers guide your way, Captain <last>." She waves, and heads off into the crowd.`

"If you would like, I could provide you with some commentary and explanation, but it is more about feeling than doing anything specific.

			`	The crowd you have joined merges with other flows of people as you all stream onward, eventually emerging from the typical hallways into a massive cave. On one side, a large opening, framed by rough stone and a handful of shield emitters, looks up toward the night sky. Stalagmites with matching stalactites above them ring the perimeter of the room, but there is no sound of drips or traces of lingering moisture here. While the walls are still rough, natural stone, the floor and all the stalagmites have been polished smooth. With a quick glance, you estimate that there are already over a hundred people in here, and more are still filtering in around you and through several other doors. Taely leads you through the crowd, frequently gesturing greetings to those she passes by.`
			`	Without warning the room stills, and all the doors close. A flurry of gestures washes out from the center of the room, as if everyone is repeating what someone has said, but you cannot see anyone starting it. "Perimeter secure?" comes the gestured question, followed by an answering ripple from the edges of the room back toward the center: "All clear."`
			`	Suddenly, you become aware of a drum beat building in the silence, and then realize that it had already started with the first ripple of gestures, so quiet that, until now, it was unnoticeable. The beat builds gradually: a slow, steady rhythm.`

As you watch, a child steps up next to her and starts also hitting the rock with their palms, slightly off-beat, changing the pattern into a hauntingly familiar one:`
			`	"Thump-thump."`
			`	"Thump-thump."`
			`	"Thump-thump."`
			`	"Thump-thump."`
			`	Looking around the room you can see people starting to move in time with the beat. Some are swaying, and some are nodding their heads or tapping their feet. Standing next to you, Taely has a hand on her heart, tapping softly. Soon you hear other drummers join in as the beat resonates throughout the room. Now people are not merely swaying to the beat, but dancing. Some spin in place, others rock back and forth between different stances, and a few have joined hands and begun moving in a circle. Everywhere you look there are people dancing in countless variations.`
			`	Out of the chaos you hear a voice rise in song. You cannot make out what it is saying, but it carries the tones of anticipation. You can, however, clearly decipher a chant from many other voices, cutting through the solo voice in time with the drumming:`

At this point, it seems that almost every single person in the room is drumming, dancing, or singing - many seem to be doing several simultaneously.`
			`	As the stars wheel through the night sky above the mouth of the cave, you note the flow of the ceremony seems to be telling a story of some kind. You understand very few snippets of words, but the emotion conveyed in the singing is clear. The early tone of anticipation shifts to the roar of excitement and then on to a peaceful tone of wonder.`
			`	As the ceremony continues, this shifts again to a steady, almost mechanical feel, which is in turn abruptly penetrated by a piercing thread of excitement, leading to the entire tone of the song becoming one of curiosity over another driving beat. The melody then seems to wander more, caught in duel tones of regret and anticipation, mourning and rejoicing, terror and hope, disorder and structure, disappointment and awe, and countless other deeply emotional pairings before finally culminating in a return to the original, unified heartbeat as the singers' voices come together, reaching upwards in hope before finally everything trails off into silence.`

			`	Through it all, Taely offers a running commentary on how each stretch of the ceremony represents a different piece of their collective history, ranging from the launch of the first human into space to its commercialization and then the new age of exploration opened by the advent of hyperdrives. It also includes numerous conflicts, disasters, and wars. Much of it is rather familiar to you from what you know of human history, but the later part is strange and unfamiliar. Filled with stories of first contact, strange ruins, alien invasions, desperate last stands, and brilliant discoveries, you are left with the impression that, despite the Remnant's current security, they have been on the precipice of extinction for much of their existence.`

Although as far as that goes, every one of these celebrations is different. Each person's participation and style is entirely up to them, so the details and feel of the group celebration as a whole are unique every time."

"For something like this, or anything of a social or spiritual nature for that matter, we determine who takes the lead for various parts at the moment, based on who is present. Whether we are talking about our connection with society, or our connection to the Universe, we must each forge our own understanding of it. As such, when we gather together for ceremonies such as this, virtually anyone could be chosen to take the lead for one of the segments.`
			`	"As a result, each celebration takes on a different feel - after all, each of us has our own unique perspective, and bring our own experiences to contribute." She pauses, and adopts a respectful tone. "The ceremony is not just about major events, either. Everyone who takes part brings their own life experiences and memories to the story we tell. Memories of friends and family who are no longer with us are common as well."`

"Even children take the lead now and then, usually with a parent or sibling to guide them." She smiles at that, then gestures for you to continue asking your questions.`

Their friends and families are proud of them, of course, but that does not change the fact that they are lost to us mortals. Sometimes the whole experience is simply overwhelming, and some of us still sorrow for other losses in our stories."`

			`	Taely strides over to a console near the closest door and retrieves a crystal from a compartment within. She slips it into a case and turns back to you. "Our celebrations are something that bind us together, and we share in both the memory of the departed and the hope for the future. As such, we keep recordings of them so that those who are not present at a particular event may still experience it too. This recording is destined for those working in Postverta, as a friend of one of those being mourned today is stationed there. Could you deliver this to them please?"`

			`When you arrive on Postverta there is a small group of Remnant waiting at the landing bay for you. As you hand the crystal to one, another gestures, "Thank you for bringing this to us, Captain <first>. Being able to join in the Remembrance will help me to celebrate those who have gone on before." The group heads off into the depths of the station, leaving you in the bay.`
			`	Taely never mentioned anything about compensation, but as soon as the Remnant leave, your commlink notifies you that you have been assigned <payment>.`

			`You note a disturbance in the shipyards before the <ship> even touches the ground. Every pad is filled with ships, camels pulling wagon trains loaded with canisters trundle out of the outfitter, and technicians clamber everywhere. As you step out of your ship, Taely slides down the side of a Merganser resting next to you.`
			`	"Good timing, Captain! We just rolled out an upgrade to some of our oldest equipment, and our Mergansers finally have something to carry as first-strike weapons. Interested in taking a look?"`
			choice
				`	"Yes."`
				`	"Sorry, but I'm a bit busy at the moment."`
					goto empno
			`	She turns and heads towards a nearby lift where another crew of Remnant had just moved several EMP torpedo canisters into place. "Well, you have probably seen us use EMP torpedoes now and then, right? Well, as you probably noticed, they have a few tactical issues. They are slow, they often hit our ships almost as much as our targets, and they take up space we could otherwise be using for more important things like laboratories or scanners." She taps a few commands into the console, and the lift begins raising the canisters towards the waiting ship.`
			`	"Over the past decades we have had a few teams working on improving them from different angles. Some focused on the torpedoes themselves, others focused on the launcher. The surprising development, however, was from a team working down in the Warren. They figured out a way to shave a few cubic meters off the systems that assemble the torpedoes, and compress the whole structure. Very impressive work, and the results should be in the outfitter for you in the next day or two."`
			`	She looks at you and nods contemplatively. "One thing worth noting - you are making great strides in learning our language, so new items that appear in our outfitter will be listed under their proper name instead of substitutes from the ancestral tongue."`
			choice
				`	"Whatever makes things easier for everyone."`
					goto empno
				`	"Thanks. What names were changed?"`
			`	She looks amused. "Mainly weapons. If something is named an adjective that describes what it does, then it was a name we made up on the spot to include in the linguistic overlay we put in place for the displays. We did that so that you would have an easier time understanding what something does. Thankfully, you no longer need such aides."`
			choice
				`	"Thanks for the explanation."`
					goto empno
				`	"Thanks! Circling back to our earlier topic, what does 'Warren' mean?"`
			`	"It is our term for the network of caves, tunnels, and spaces deep underground. All three of our main worlds have them in some form or another. We know a little about the original people who built them, but not nearly as much as we would like. They called themselves the Zitchal Maudrakoi, and one of the most distinguishing features we have been able to learn about them is that they do not seem to attach much importance to directionality. For example, in a control room we found, there were instruments and controls on every available surface, with just a scattering of handholds to support the operator." She shrugs. "Plume or Dusk would know more than I about them. I mostly focus on understanding their equipment."`
			label empno
			`	"Well, I should get back to work, then. Next time you are in space, take a look at how our ships fare in battle. Hopefully you will see an improvement." She grabs a couple components from a nearby lift, and scrambles back up the side of the Merganser to continue working on an a new bay.`
