With the launch of two new ships in such a short time, I know I feel like I need to just relax a bit." She sighs. "It makes me feel guilty, honestly. I have accomplished so much, and there are so many things to be grateful for, but I even have more projects in development to focus on." She looks lost in thought for a moment.`

			`	Looking outside the ship, you can see a multitude of tourist-oriented facilities overwhelming the normal spaceport functions. You can pick out a small sign off to the side that indicates professional commodity and banking facilities, but otherwise the area is dominated by businesses offering mountain touring, sports classes, and vehicle rentals. Next to you, Taely alternates between peering out at the signs and reading brochures on a new commlink. "Here, <first>. This one sounds more interested in providing a challenge and less pampering.

You rent a hovercar from one of the rental companies and make the short trek out to the resort. The rest of the day is spent out on the slopes, where both you and Taely eventually develop sufficient skill to graduate from the easy runs up to the medium difficulty. You both fall repeatedly, but Taely's good humor is contagious as she takes the inevitable facefuls of snow in stride.`

You rent a hovercar from one of the rental companies and make the short trek out to the resort. The rest of the day is spent out on the slopes, where you teach Taely the basics of hoverboarding. By the end of the day Taely has impressed you with her quick learning and you finish off with a few runs down some of the more challenging slopes. Taely spills a few times, but she takes her failures in good humor, and never seems to make the same mistake twice.`
			label "vail head home"
			`	Heading back to the spaceport after a day of hoverboarding, Taely surprises you by pulling the hood open on the hovercar and spending almost an hour going over the internal systems before closing it up with a nod. "Well, that was interesting. The hovercar, I mean." She gestures at it with her commlink. "So many different manufacturers were involved in making this vehicle. Sometimes I wonder if humanity appreciates the luxury such diversity affords them." She looks thoughtful, then gestures toward the ship. "Well, <first>, I promised you a tour of a historic Remnant district. Caelian has perhaps the best example of one, so I would recommend we go there."`
	on complete
		conversation
			`Taely directs you to a landing pad on the outskirts of the main spaceport, in an area that seems mostly filled with Gulls and Pelicans shifting larger quantities of products. Disembarking from the <ship>, she leads you down a large series of escalators that branch off in several directions, occasionally connecting with large ramps filled with steady streams of cargo traffic. After a few minutes they deposit you on a large platform.`
			`	Approaching the edge of the platform, Taely puts out her arm to stop you from advancing any farther. "Watch out for the barrier," she says as she puts a hand out and touches something in mid-air in front of you. As she leans on it you can see faint ripples around her hand. "They are an essential safety feature, but they can still hurt if you run into them." She gestures to easily recognizable hazard markings on the floor. "With time you will learn to notice the faint shield ripples in the air, but meanwhile, just remember that anywhere that has the 'stand-back' lines on the floor likely has shields above it most of the time."`
			`	Moments later, you see why the barriers are in place as a large train whooshes into the station at high speed before quickly coming to a stop. The barrier vanishes, and Taely leads you onto the train. Looking up and down the length of it, you can see hundreds, maybe even thousands of Remnant entering and exiting the train. Within moments the doors close, and the train starts moving again as you are pressed back into your seat. You see a few lights flicker past outside the window, but soon there is nothing outside but a monotonous dark blur.`
			`	Taely notices your gaze. "Sorry, but there will not be much to see out there. The entire train line is quite far underground. Far enough to simply pass under terrain obstacles like rivers, valleys, or chasms." She nods to herself in satisfaction. "This will not be a long trip: we will only spend a few minutes at top speed before we start decelerating near our destination. I would recommend buckling into the harness."`
			choice
				`	"I am looking forward to seeing where we are going."`
					goto "our destination"
				`	"How fast does this go?"`
			`	"The C3-L0 Maglev has a maximum rated velocity of 11D.E78 meters per second, and can sustain that almost indefinitely so long as the track remains powered. In practice, it rarely maintains that velocity for more than a few minutes at a time, as it is a local transport train. We do have some that go faster, but the amount of acceleration required to make use of them on short tracks is not terribly practical." She looks wistful. "Many people are working on solving the inertia problem, but Embers only know when that will result in something practical."`
			choice
				`	"Interesting. How long until we arrive?"`
					goto "our destination"
				`	"Why is that number so precise?"`
				`	"That sounds like the speed of light."`
			`	Taely smiles. "After all the safety factors, margins for error, and assorted other adjustments were taken into account, someone noticed that, when expressed in scientific notation, the coefficient of the rated value was calculated to be 1.1DE79, a fraction above the coefficient of the speed of light in a vacuum, so they adjusted the rated maximum velocity down only slightly so that they would match."`
			choice
				`	"Thanks for the explanation."`
					goto "our destination"
				`	"What is a coefficient?"`
				`	"What is scientific notation?"`
			`	"Here, I will switch to base 10 to make it easier for you to understand." She pulls up a hologram with 299,792,458 m/s on it. As she speaks, the number shifts to 2.99792458x10^8 m/s. "When we write out a number such as the speed of light, it is typical to break it into parts. This is generally referred to as scientific notation. This is done to facilitate comparing and working with large numbers. The first part, 2.99792458 in this case, would be called the coefficient. The second part, x10, is called the base; and the third part, ^8 is the exponent." The display shifts again to show 1.1DE784Ax10^7 m/s. "So this would be how we typically write the speed of light when we are using it in our research. So, 1.1DE78 is the coefficient of both the speed of light and the speed of the train, just with a different exponent." She pauses, then vanishes the display. "We will be arriving momentarily, so I should probably stop there."`
			label "our destination"
			`	After several minutes, the lights in the train car suddenly pulse several times, and the train starts to decelerate heavily. You can feel yourself pushing into the harness as the train slows and comes to a stop. Unbuckling, Taely leads you out onto the platform, and then up a long escalator to the surface. Emerging into the sunlight, you find yourself looking around at a scene that seems almost anachronistic.`
			scene "scene/remnant remote spaceport"
			`	Taely looks around with pride, and then watches your reaction with amusement.`
			choice
				`	"I do not know what to make of this."`
				`	"This is a spaceport?"`
			`	She nods, and guides you amongst the stream of camel-drawn hovercarts heading for the gate. "This is one of our earliest spaceports, before we learned new techniques better suited to our new home. Our founding ships brought as much as they could, of course, but as it turns out, the earliest phases of expansion look much the same, whether one is looking at historic pre-flight eras or modern settlement efforts."`

			scene "scene/remnant remote spaceport"
			`	Taely picks up a board from a nearby pile. "We were fortunate that Caelian had some vegetation that could be used like this. The native vegetation is biologically quite different from the trees of Earth, but they have similar structural characteristics and grow plentifully in many areas." She offers you the board. "The decision was made early on that anything that could be made from locally sourced materials, should be sourced locally. We wanted to conserve our limited supplies of metals and other rare resources for things that required it." She taps on a barrel. "These are a prime example - a few metal straps enable the wood to hold a significant amount of liquid. It is much the same as how a comparatively small amount of bone in our bodies can provide the necessary structure for a large volume of soft tissues and organs to function."`
				goto "question loop"
			label "camel cart"
			scene "scene/remnant remote spaceport"
			`	"Is that so? The engineering advantages are quite simple: with the mechanics of the cart focused entirely on supporting the load and the camel providing horizontal motion, the cart can support much larger masses than it could if it had to split the forces." She looks wistful. "In truth, I am somewhat envious of the industrial capacity the ancestral worlds contain - we have accomplished much, but we have had to make choices, and one of those was the decision as to where to spend our industrial capacity. We chose, obviously, to focus on spacecraft and heavy industrial applications. We have no cars, no personal vehicles at all, really. Even these hovercarts are basically the repulsor systems from our spacecraft that have been repurposed to carry massive loads."`
			`	Taely gestures out through the gate at the distant landscape. "It is ironic that, in many respects, the distant stars are more accessible to us than the metaphorical far side of the mountain. Those of us who explore our worlds often resort to long expeditions with camel trains to carry all their scientific equipment. Spending months away from friends or family while on a project is commonplace, even for those who never leave the surface of our planets. Many of our explorers, in fact, live nomadic lifestyles - moving every couple of weeks to a new research location as they study, document, and analyze the world." Her gestures take on a reverent tone. "Many of our most important discoveries can be attributed to these explorers."`
			`	Her tone shifts to one of amusement. "We were lucky, though. Our camels were able to sustain themselves on several categories of local vegetation right from the start. It took quite a bit of experimentation with bacterial cultures, however, before we were able to enable them to really forage properly. Now they thrive here. Some experts suspect that, if we were to ever leave, the camels would probably continue to survive here for millennia to come."`
				goto "question loop"
			label "stone walls"
			scene "scene/remnant remote spaceport"
			`	Taely's expression becomes mournful as she leads you over to the walls. "We discovered soon after we arrived here that this planet was not as safe as it appeared. It had a variety of natural predators, including swarms of predatory creatures that were very aggressive in hunting us. They preferred darkness, and while they had excellent eyesight, their hearing was even sharper. A swarm could triangulate the position of a person from a single spoken word at great distances."`
			`	She gestures up at the edge of the wall. "Fortunately, we discovered that while they were quite competent climbers, they could not navigate overhangs. So while such lips are generally considered a structural vulnerability when defending against modern weapons, they are indispensable for containing local wildlife. These walls served as well later on, too, when we had to deal with Korath ground attacks and other more complex threats."`
				goto "question loop"
			label "wind turbine"
			scene "scene/remnant remote spaceport"
			`	"They are indeed wind turbines." She steps through the gate to a spot with a better view. You can see that while the ones on the wall are only a couple of meters tall, the ones on top of the towers are significantly bigger. "Our ancestors rightly guessed that anywhere that had sufficient atmosphere to dispense with pressure suits would also have wind. The vertical style also has the advantage that it handles high wind speeds and rapid variation in direction much better than some of the shapes that were more traditional at the time of the exodus. It seems to be a good precaution, as it has enabled these to survive the harsh windstorms that can sweep across the continent. While they have been repaired and improved over the centuries, these wind turbines still provide sufficient power for much of the agricultural uses out here, so we let them continue. They are also useful to remind us from where we have come."`
				goto "question loop"
			label "main return"
			`	Taely leads you around the area for a few more hours, pointing out historical features, places where they resurrected trades and skills from before the advent of flight, and other interesting things. Eventually she heads back to the train station, which deposits you back in the main spaceport.`
			`	"I hope you enjoyed the tour, <first>. It was interesting to see our history through fresh eyes." She smiles mischievously. "And I enjoyed the hoverboarding, too. Maybe we can do it again sometime." She pauses for a moment, focusing on something you cannot see. "Looks like duty calls. Embers guide your way, Captain <last>." She waves, and heads off into the crowd.`

			`	The crowd you have joined merges with other flows of people as you all stream onward, eventually emerging from the typical hallways into a massive cave. On one side, a large opening, framed by rough stone and a handful of shield emitters, looks up towards the night sky. Stalagmites with matching stalactites above them ring the perimeter of the room, but there is no sound of drips or traces of lingering moisture here. While the walls are still rough, natural stone, the floor and all the stalagmites have been polished smooth. With a quick glance, you estimate that there are already over a hundred people in here, and more are still filtering in around you and through several other doors. Taely leads you through the crowd, frequently gesturing greetings to those she passes by.`
			`	Taely gestures quietly to you. "We start with the ritual query and response asking if we are safe. Safe in this moment, at least."`

			`	Without warning the room stills, and all the doors close. A flurry of gestures washes out from the center of the room, as if everyone is repeating what someone has said, but you cannot see anyone starting it. "Perimeter secure?" comes the gestured question, followed by an answering ripple from the edges of the room back toward the center: "All clear."`
			`	Suddenly, you become aware of a drum beat building in the silence, and then realize that it had already started with the first ripple of gestures, so quiet that, until now, it was unnoticeable. The beat builds gradually: a slow, steady rhythm.`

				to display
					has "remnant: celebration: annotated"
			`	The beat echoes in the cavern, but you quickly manage to locate the source: an elderly Remnant using her hands to drum against a polished stalagmite that, judging by the resonance, appears to be hollow. As you watch, a child steps up next to her and starts also hitting the rock with their palms, slightly off-beat, changing the pattern into a hauntingly familiar one:`
			`	"Thump-thump."`
			`	"Thump-thump."`
			`	"Thump-thump."`

			`	Looking around the room you can see people starting to move in time with the beat. Some are swaying, and some are nodding their heads or tapping their feet. Standing next to you, Taely has a hand on her heart, tapping softly. Soon you hear other drummers join in as the beat resonates throughout the room. Now people are not merely swaying to the beat, but dancing. Some spin in place, others rock back and forth between different stances, and a few have joined hands and begun moving in a circle. Everywhere you look there are people dancing in countless variations.`
			`	Out of the chaos you hear a voice rise in song. You cannot make out what it is saying, but it carries the tones of anticipation. You can, however, clearly decipher a chant from many other voices, cutting through the solo voice in time with the drumming:`

			`	On the final word the chant ends and dozens of deep voices join together in a roaring crescendo before fading away, replaced by many new voices expressing tones of wonder. At this point, it seems that almost every single person in the room is drumming, dancing, or singing - many seem to be doing several simultaneously.`
			`	As the stars wheel through the night sky above the mouth of the cave, you note the flow of the ceremony seems to be telling a story of some kind. You understand very few snippets of words, but the emotion conveyed in the singing is clear. The early tone of anticipation shifts to the roar of excitement and then on to a peaceful tone of wonder.`
			`	As the ceremony continues, this shifts again to a steady, almost mechanical feel, which is in turn abruptly penetrated by a piercing thread of excitement, leading to the entire tone of the song becoming one of curiosity over another driving beat. The melody then seems to wander more, caught in dual tones of regret and anticipation, mourning and rejoicing, terror and hope, disorder and structure, disappointment and awe, and countless other deeply emotional pairings before finally culminating in a return to the original, unified heartbeat as the singers' voices come together, reaching upwards in hope before finally everything trails off into silence.`
			`	Through it all, Taely offers a running commentary on how each stretch of the ceremony represents a different piece of their collective history, ranging from the launch of the first human into space to its commercialization and then the new age of exploration opened by the advent of hyperdrives. It also includes numerous conflicts, disasters, and wars. Much of it is rather familiar to you from what you know of human history, but the later part is strange and unfamiliar. Filled with stories of first contact, strange ruins, alien invasions, desperate last stands, and brilliant discoveries, you are left with the impression that, despite the Remnant's current security, they have been on the precipice of extinction for much of their existence.`

After the silence lingers for what feels like several minutes, the doors open and people start to leave. In short order the cave is nearly empty.`

Although as far as that goes, every one of these celebrations is different. Each person's participation and style is entirely up to them, so the details and feel of the group celebration as a whole are unique every time."

As such, when we gather together for ceremonies such as this, virtually anyone could be chosen to take the lead for one of the segments.`

"Well, you have probably seen us use EMP Torpedoes now and then, right? Well, as you probably noticed, they have a few tactical issues. They are slow, they often hit our ships almost as much as our targets, and they take up space we could otherwise be using for more important things like laboratories or scanners." She taps a few commands into the console, and the lift begins raising the canisters towards the waiting ship.`
			`	"Over the past decades we have had a few teams working on improving them from different angles. Some focused on the torpedoes themselves, others focused on the launcher. The surprising development, however, was from a team working down in the Warren. They figured out a way to shave a few cubic meters off the systems that assemble the torpedoes, and compress the whole structure. Very impressive work, and the results should be in the outfitter for you in the next day or two."`

We know a little about the original people who built them, but not nearly as much as we would like. They called themselves the Zitchal Maudrakoi, and one of the most distinguishing features we have been able to learn about them is that they do not seem to attach much importance to directionality. For example, in a control room we found, there were instruments and controls on every available surface, with just a scattering of handholds to support the operator." She shrugs. "Plume or Dusk would know more than I about them. I mostly focus on understanding their equipment."`

Other Remnant appear to aim some equipment at it, and after a moment or two, the object expands to several times its original size. "These are recordings from our explorations of the ruins, demonstrating the decompression of a Maudrakoi artifact. While not identical, these artifacts generate similar readings to those recorded during your scan of the Shattered Light.`

			`	"We do not have time for an in-depth presentation, but the short version is this: the Maudrakoi are the primary civilization that lived on these worlds before we arrived. They are not the only civilization to have lived here, but they are the one we find most often in the archaeological record. Fortunately for our research, it seems that they lived extensively underground in complexes such as this one."`
			`	Her gestures take on an appreciative tone. "The Maudrakoi made extensive use of the materials that make our ships and architecture so distinctive, and this has allowed their cities and technologies to survive the eons since they went extinct. One technology of note is they had an interesting ability to manipulate space. They used this to make large, highly complex objects, and then, for lack of a better term, partially embed them in pocket dimensions so as to not be entirely present. They used this frequently to allow equipment and materials to be much smaller than normal." She shrugs, and gestures with a frustrated tone. "We cannot replicate it, but we have figured out how to disrupt the compression, and thus recover the artifact."`
			`	The hologram shifts back to showing the Shattered Light. "This ship does not show the same signatures as the Maudrakoi artifacts, but we think it is sufficiently similar that our equipment should work on it too. Hopefully. In any case, though, time is passing, so we should start loading." With that, the Remnant gather their equipment and head out.`

"What you probably know as 'Hyperspace' is what we technically call the Secondary Weft. There are a few others we are fairly confident exist, and several that we have hypothesized might exist but we have no means of confirming. Practically, each of these overlaps with the Primary Weft to some extent." His gestures take on an amused tone. "Of course, what we call the Primary Weft is only primary to those of us who live here. For all we know, there may be people living elsewhere that consider their own weft to be the primary one. Nothing says ours is special or the best or anything of the sort.

Ruach and a small group of Remnant are gathered around a hologram of the ship, and seem to be co-ordinating teams exploring it.

"We have had the opportunity to start querying the onboard systems and piece together a little of the Shattered Light's history. Particularly the logs.`
			`	"As we all know, it was part of the Exodus fleet that entered the Terminus wormhole. Unlike most of the other ships, however, it never emerged from the other side. Fortunately, it had a significantly larger array of instruments than was normal for ships of its type, and it looks like at least some of the databanks survived."`
			`	At this point another Remnant takes up the narrative. "Based on the initial incident logs, it appears that something in the stabilization fields failed during transit. The data is not clear whether the systems failed, or if something in the wormhole fluctuations exceeded the parameters that the systems could handle. In any case, the ship appears to have been shunted laterally from the wormhole in mid-transit.`
			`	"It is unclear what happened after that, but the ship was subject to significant forces including unidentified impacts that caused multiple system failures. The data loses some coherence at this point, but it basically seems to have been semi-permanently stuck out-of-phase with the prime weft until an energy surge destabilized it and it wobbled back into prime coherence. At that point, it started being visible again, and shortly after, you spotted it."`

She gestures around at the equipment expanding out of the side of the ship. "As you can see, we have already started the process and found that much of it is operational."`
			`	One of the other Remnant continues. "The Shattered Light carried what amounts to an entire heavy industrial factory. Everything from smelters to welding equipment and everything in between." They smile and their gestures take on a tone of irony. "In fact, the ships we have now are in no small part due to the Shattered Light's absence. Without these capabilities, the choice about whether or not to commit to learning the techniques of those who lived here before us was much easier. If the Shattered Light had arrived on schedule we may well still be building ships out of the traditional materials prevalent at the time."`

Right now we do not have any real need to put all this machinery to work, and as such we do not have the resources to spare to get it fully operational. That being said, if ever you would like a replica of the Shattered Light, we could use this equipment to build one."`
			`	Her gestures take on an apologetic tone. "It will not be a perfect replica as we will have to use our own systems for most of the internals, and the resource allotment cost will be significantly higher than it would have been back at the Tycho Crater shipyard on Luna... but if you have the resources and interest, the opportunity is there. The shipyard will have more information for you in a day or two." Her gestures trail off with a sign that indicates vast possibilities.`

			`Chilia is waiting for you when you land. Judging by the hologram floating before him, he appears to already be reviewing the data from your scan.

				`	"You were right in suspecting that this new ship carries an additional fighter. One more fighter might not change much in combat, but if the Korath are building new warships, they may also be building stronger fighters."`

If it were a typical warship obstructing our operations, we would request you track it down and eliminate it, but because ships of this type tend to be home to a large civilian population, destroying or capturing it outright may instigate a reprisal, especially in that sector.`
			`	"Would you be up for disabling it, so the threat is eliminated while preserving the lives of the innocents on board?" His signs shift from a questioning tone to a confident one. "After you are done we can disarm the ship and fix their jump drive. If they adhere to their typical doctrine they should decide to head back home."`

			`You find Chilia with a relieved look on his face when you land.`
			`	"These assignments are typically handled by our most trusted teams, as taking on the larger Korath vessels is a sensitive matter. Most of their larger ships are home to large groups of Korath civilians, including children. I must admit there were concerns you might not be those children's best chance, but our fleet was occupied elsewhere at the time. I am glad I was not wrong in my assessment of you," he signs with a content smile on his face.`
			`	"We must be careful not to let ignorance of Korath society result in the unnecessary destruction of similar ships. Now that you have shown you can handle these tasks with the proper finesse, you can expect these to turn up in the task board in the future." Chilia then walks away with a confident pace.`
