		`	She nods sympathetically. "Things have been a bit hectic lately, what with dimensional pockets and mysterious new aliens. I can understand wanting to slow down a bit. With the launch of two new ships in such a short time, I know I feel like I need to just relax a bit." She sighs "It makes me feel guilty, honestly. I have accomplished so much, and there are so many things to be grateful for. I even have more projects in development to focus on." She looks lost in thought for a moment.`

"The idea of an entire planet devoted to leisure activities seems so extravagant... Well, I am just really curious to see it. Now, this is not a mission we are asking you to do, so I cannot offer any logistics compensation. I could, however, show you some of our history in exchange. Are you interested?"`

		`	"Really? I noted a mention of that in the descriptions, and it looked challenging." Her commlink shifts to display a hologram of a hoverboarder executing a jump with an artistic poof of snow around them. "Anyway, I think this trip should be a good diversion for us both. I will meet you onboard the <ship> shortly."`
