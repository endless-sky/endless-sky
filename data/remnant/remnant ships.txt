	description "Once they left human space, it became apparent to the Remnant that they would need to build their own shipyards in order to defend themselves if they were discovered by the Alphas or any other unfriendly faction. Using new composite materials that they discovered, they built ships very different from anything seen in human space."

	description `The Tycho Crater Cooperative's Dromedary was one of the foremost colonization ships during the early era before piracy became rampant and triggered the necessity for city-ships to be more combat-oriented. These ships incorporate extensive hydroponics, large construction equipment installations, and hundreds of densely packed "dream cells" built to transport people in bulk.`
	description "	Since the Remnant do not have schematics for the Dromedary, just the highly-modified example of the Shattered Light, this ship is actually a commemorative replica of that specific ship. As such, it combines the original's odd mix of eclectic modifications with new Remnant systems."
	description "	Unfortunately, since they lack the manufacturing facilities that would normally support a large construction project, it will cost massively more than it would have originally back on Luna."

	description "	This is a wreck. A ship that once might have held hundreds of people has no functional environmental system, the once verdant hydroponics domes are shattered, and much of the ship appears to be destroyed. Burns, strange scrapes, and twists to structural elements abound. Only a smattering of droids persistently continuing their work manage to maintain any degree of functionality."

	description "While the Starling was the first successful ship to use technology derived from alien ruins, the Gull is the most recent. The current increase in Korath activities has caused foraging for resources to become a risky endeavor, forcing the Remnant to develop a specialized freighter for hauling cargo from remote sites without revealing their presence to hostile aliens."
	description "	The Gull has quickly proven its worth, allowing the Starling fleets to return to riskier activities while the Gull takes over the hazardous convoy routes. It is now the primary element of the Remnant's extra-territorial resource operations."
	description "	The cloaking technology is built into the Gull's hull; it cannot be removed or transferred to another ship."

	description "The Heron is the Remnant's ultimate last resort: Flight. These mobile starports are built to serve as the core elements of evacuation fleets when the Remnant are ultimately pushed to the brink of destruction in their home systems. These massive ships are capable of lifting enormous amounts of resources and operate both in space and on land, and are continuously updated to make full use of the latest technological innovations."
	description "	The few Herons in existence are carefully guarded secrets that embody the Remnant's core tactics of speed, stealth, and survival. Given the tiny number that exist, they are never available for discretionary use by Remnant captains and are always operated under the authority and direction of a prefect."

	description "The Ibis is a multipurpose carrier that serves as a mobile mining platform, an escort ship for Pelican fleets, and a combat platform using Terns for screening. It is capable of fielding a single wing of support craft, consisting of two Petrels and four Terns."
	description "	The Ibis was designed shortly after the Albatross as a means of extending the range of resource collection efforts after the Remnant realized that an Alpha invasion might not be as imminent as originally believed."

	description "The Pelican is closely based on the original semi-organic materials the Remnant found in the Ember Waste. While they are not technically alive, their internal mechanisms and method of construction bear such a close resemblance to living organisms that they are often considered as such. One key feature of this living resemblance is the innate sensory capabilities they possess, akin to sensor suites less advanced ships require for detailed scanning. These ships serve as the backbone of Remnant bulk salvage efforts, as well as their fast-logistics distribution network."

	description "	The Peregrine was designed along the lines of old-earth's fast-attack cruisers. Drawing on inspiration from its namesake, famed for being the fastest self-propelled lifeform on Earth, it is designed to strike hard and fast. It closes quickly with enemies to unleash devastating barrages in the opening seconds of combat."

	description "The Remnant have long favored turns of action that avoid putting crew directly at risk; though their Terns are a rather effective result of this ideology, the Remnant still had to face the fact that, eventually, one of their manned ships was going to end up too crippled to escape to safety. To that end, the Smew was developed; though quite lightly armed, Smews are capable of carrying a considerable quantity of cargo and passengers for a ship of their size, and are durable enough to absorb some fire from enemies while doing so."
	description "	Though originally designed as lifeboats, the surprisingly mobile freighter-fighter hybrid has seen a remarkable amount of usage in mining fleets, as a way to supplement the otherwise poor cargo capacity of the Ibis. Because their purpose can vary from fleet to fleet, Smews are traditionally sold with a fair amount of free space: enough for a small weapon, upgraded engines, or additional support systems."

	description "One of the strangest and most useful things that the Remnant have discovered in the abandoned worlds of the Ember Waste is alien cloaking technology. They have designed their scout ships to cloak when needed in order to explore alien territory without being seen... or to escape in a hurry after stealing something particularly valuable from those aliens."
	description "	The cloaking technology is built into the Starling's hull; it cannot be removed or transferred to another ship."

	description "The Tern is a small, hardy drone developed to plunge into the atmosphere of nearby gas giants for collecting valuable resources. These thick-shelled craft are also surprisingly effective when pressed into service as screening ships when enemies intrude into Remnant space."
	description "	Unlike most spacefaring nations, the Remnant do not have enough people to pilot fighter wings in waves likely to sustain significant casualties. As such, they frequently use these hardy drones to fulfill similar screening roles in their home systems, allowing manned craft to focus on more specialized tasks."
	description "	Drones do not come equipped with a hyperdrive. You cannot carry a drone unless you have a ship in your fleet with a drone bay."
