	description "Once they left human space, it became apparent to the Remnant that they would need to build their own shipyards in order to defend themselves if they were discovered by the Alphas or any other unfriendly faction. Using new composite materials that they discovered, they built ships very different from anything seen in human space."

	description "While the Starling was the first successful ship to use technology derived from alien ruins, the Gull is the most recent. The current increase in Korath activities has caused foraging for resources to become a risky endeavor, forcing the Remnant to develop a specialized freighter for hauling cargo from remote sites without revealing their presence to hostile aliens."
	description "	The Gull has quickly proven its worth, allowing the Starling fleets to return to riskier activities while the Gull takes over the hazardous convoy routes. It is now the primary element of the Remnant's extra-territorial resource operations."
	description "	The cloaking technology is built into the Gull's hull; it cannot be removed or transferred to another ship."

	description "The Pelican is closely based on the original semi-organic materials the Remnant found in the Ember Waste. While they are not technically alive, their internal mechanisms and method of construction bear such a close resemblance to living organisms that they are often considered as such. One key feature of this living resemblance is the innate sensory capabilities they possess, akin to sensor suites less advanced ships require for detailed scanning. These ships serve as the backbone of Remnant bulk salvage efforts, as well as their fast-logistics distribution network."

	description "The Petrel is a multi-role mining/wing leader fightercraft designed to provide support for flights of lighter Terns in high-risk environments. The ship's design originated as an urban mobile gun platform that flitted around structures and natural terrain, but proved easy to adapt into a spacecraft."
	description "	The Remnant are loath to sacrifice pilots and crew from the comparatively small pool they are drawn from. As such, their fighters are equipped with medium-range weaponry designed to strike enemies from afar."

	description "The Tern is a small, hardy drone developed to plunge into the atmosphere of nearby gas giants for collecting valuable resources. These thick-shelled craft are also surprisingly effective when pressed into service as screening ships when enemies intrude into Remnant space."
	description "	Unlike most spacefaring nations, the Remnant do not have enough people to pilot fighter wings in waves likely to sustain significant casualties. As such, they frequently use these hardy drones to fulfill similar screening roles in their home systems, allowing manned craft to focus on more specialized tasks."
