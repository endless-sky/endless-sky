# Replaced by the "remnant: puffin" event but still listed here so older versions of the "Remnant: Void Sprites 3" mission already instantiated in save file when
# players update do not have issues with this event being undefined.
# The actual content of the event is not strictly necessary, since a patch mission already exists that applies the new event if the condition for this event is present.
# But the event still needs to be declared so it can be considered "defined" by the game, otherwise, it will disable the mission referring to it.
# TODO: This can be safely removed if we ever stop supporting save files from older versions of the game.

It is obviously ancient, and patches of ambiguous green and purple material resembling fungus grow through the walls. Whoever built this station designed it for beings much larger than you - either that, or they liked spacious environments. Even the shortest doorway you pass through is easily double your height. They are always wider than they are tall.`
		description `	Exploring beyond the docks reveals that most of this facility is infrastructure for some type of massive emitter. It is not clear exactly what it's supposed to be emitting, but it might have something to do with how this system appeared in the first place.`
		spaceport `The Remnant have set up a fully self-contained base of operations in this part of the station. Independent life support, its own power system, and controls tapping into the rest of station occupy much of the space, while a Research Laboratory and additional equipment fill up the rest. A rudimentary cafeteria, communication links, basic repair equipment, and sleeping quarters round out the amenities of this research camp.`

		description `You are not quite sure what Fertriery is. It lacks cohesive edges, and yet it has sufficient atmospheric pressure to threaten the hull integrity of ships not designed for high pressure environments. Despite such density, which would indicate a strong gravitational presence, your sensors are unable to find any kind of core.`
		spaceport `Delving further into the clouds, it becomes obvious that the entire planet appears to be a mix of gases, aerosols, and suspended particles. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, void sprites appear to thrive in its depths, where they can be seen dancing among energy currents reminiscent of the ion storms.`
