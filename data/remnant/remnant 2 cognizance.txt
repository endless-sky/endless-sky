			choice
				`	(Accept his explanation.)`
					goto acceptance
				`	"Could you explain?"`
			`	"While the Remnant have an all-encompassing hierarchy to ensure everyone answers to someone, we saw fit to keep all facets of our society merged to prevent fragmentation into 'civilian' or 'military' branches. Two aspects of this merging are the decision of when to invoke military force and what amount of force is worthwhile. According to my position as a researcher, I have the authority to designate something a threat to my projects or to the Remnant as a whole. I could even order someone to act on it. However, given that I am of low status in terms of military proficiency, I cannot dictate the magnitude of the military response, and I am subject to being overruled by those with higher military qualifications."`
			`	"In our particular situation, I have higher xenobiology qualifications than you, so I can dictate to you, and most other xenobiologists, for that matter, that protecting the void sprites is a priority. However, you are more skilled at combat and military matters than I am. Therefore it is your decision as to how important it is relative to other military tasks. Likewise, it is your decision as to what amount of force is required, tactics used, or other such military considerations."`
			`	"This is one of the aspects that set prefects apart: They are Remnant who have demonstrated excellence in their field, sound judgment across a variety of fields, and an affinity for balancing a multitude of demands on Remnant resources. Humility is also a requirement, as they must always recognize that while their particular combination of skills may be unique, there is always someone else who is better than them at any one thing. As such, prefects are the adjudicators in determining the priority of our various tasks and the leaders who keep the Remnant unified."`
			choice
				`	"Thanks for the explanation!"`
					goto acceptance
				`	"I thought prefects were specialists."`
			`	"Well, they are and are not. Most prefects are assigned particular tasks that they are expected to devote themselves to. Often, this task relates to their area of expertise, but it is not always the case. Generally speaking, a prefect is considered to be the ultimate authority on tasks that they have been assigned to, but they are expected to take into account the suggestions from other prefects and the specialists in the fields relevant to the task.`
			`	"Given your own skills, I suspect that the prefects you are most likely to interact with would be Prefect Chilia, who coordinates the military defense of the Remnant, and Prefect Taely, who integrates our latest innovations into usable ships."`

The developments of that time period resulted in the completion of the hyperspace relay network, new terraforming techniques, and advanced genetic engineering capabilities." His face clouds at that. "This, of course, culminated in the Alphas." He pauses, then shakes his head. "But you asked who our ancestors were, not about human history.`
			`	"In that era there were a number of burgeoning astronomy and exploration programs across human space. Despite also benefiting from the substantial budget increases that science in general was receiving, they were being pushed to the margins of the academic community: Unlike many of the more practical sciences like biology and chemistry which were coming up with new wonders, astronomy and astrophysics was purely academic. There was no budget in explaining the whys of the universe, not when other scientists were creating homo superior and unleashing instantaneous interstellar communication.`
			`	"So they banded together. It was not, I gather from the records, an unusual thing for academics of a particular field to meet with others of their field. If one faculty could not fund an expedition, perhaps two different faculties working together could. Eventually they formed a loose organization, a sort of 'standing conference' on astronomy and astrophysics, through which they met to discuss, debate, and organize."`

Many of our ancestors have told stories about calling themselves the 'Exploration Vector,' alluding to the fact that they were the one subset of humanity on a course to head out into the furthest reaches of space. They even held contests about who could go the furthest from inhabited space, or who could spend the longest time between resupply stops.`
			`	"When the war against the Alphas started, it was these people who had the most knowledge and experience with the farthest reaches of space. While many outfitters might sell a captain a map showing the hyperjumps a few systems into the uninhabited territories, it was our ancestors who had spent years living in those systems while they did their research. Thus they were the ones who got the jobs running supplies, or flying reconnaissance. They saw first-hand the way the war was going. They made the rendezvous and picked up the equipment drops, and they grew increasingly worried."`

Strange ships that slipped over the horizon, odd energy signatures in the distance, novel equipment that simply showed up on Deep ships without explanation... It seemed like someone out there was taking advantage of the chaos to influence humanity. Someone beyond the reach of the normal hyperspace network. It spurred our ancestors to revisit old theories and kindle new ones. Knowing that there was someone, something beyond what we knew made us bold. It was not long before the first ship traveled through the wormhole."`

Never enough to attract the attention of the big corporate entities, but enough to be comfortable. Her captain was always making modifications. Not a genius by any means, but what they lacked in brilliance, they made up for in dedication and willingness to experiment. According to our records, making modifications to the Shadow Step was their main hobby, and the small crew they flew with had similar interests." Dusk pauses to take a drink.`
			`	"Thanks to the bravery of the Shadow Step and her crew, the hard work of the researchers that worked with them, and the contributions of a vast number of other ships and teams, the way out was discovered." Dusk signs this last with a note of finality, and many of the Remnant who were listening make the sign for "respect" and "together."`

I found the study of our ancestors to be an intriguing one, so I have spent much time searching out my families' history.

Well, we will see what the data says and decide from there."`

Whatever it is, it is quite small: Without all the construction rigging, you suspect that it would probably be only slightly larger than a Puffin.`
			`	As you peer around the supports a Remnant scurries up with a slimy cable in a bag and hands it to you. "Here, Taely will need this in a few seconds, could you hand it to her when she asks for it? I need to go find the next part. Thanks!" The Remnant vanishes into an adjacent storage room before you even have the chance to respond. Almost immediately, however, Taely twists around to look back at you. "Oh, <first>!

Starting long before we established our first shipyard, we have been constantly innovating and trying out new ship designs. Every new development is put on the conceptual model to see if it can help us build a better ship." She grimaces slightly. "Well, that is a bit hyperbolic. Not every development applies to spacecraft, just the ones of most interest to me." She grins at that. "In any case, several of our development projects are nearing the point of production, and this prototype should be operational within a few days."`
			`	She pats a piece of exposed hull, and you think you can almost feel some kind of vibration or hum in response. Taely takes on a distant expression, as if lost in thought. After a long enough pause to feel awkward, she blinks a few times and focuses on you again. "Sorry about that. A new ship waking up and all that." She smiles, thoughtfully. "Before I get absorbed in my work again, would you be able to make a delivery for me? It is a simple one, but important. I need someone to deliver a set of data files to <stopovers>.

The drop is quite sudden." Looking around, you note that there are what look like toeholds bolted to the floor around the edge of the room, and your guide has inserted his feet into one pair.`
			`	As soon as you gesture that you are ready, the floor seems to drop out from below you. It seems as though you are in an elevator dropping down so fast that you are experiencing negative g-forces.

At the opposite end of the hall is a massive door flanked with several large devices that look remarkably similar to Point Defense Turrets, but subtly different. Your guide takes a few steps into the room, and a short pedestal pops out of the floor near him. He pulls a license out of his pocket, places it in the slot, and presses firmly on it for a second, before removing it once again.`

Shields flare in and out of existence around the two of you, forming a series of openings that allow you to approach the vault door, which opens when you reach it. Inside is a disappointingly small room with a small tray on a pedestal.`

"We are not sure what they are intended to hold, but their design includes a lot of passageways and chambers that resemble a hive or a miniature city.

"It must have been quite the feat to survive and prosper in a world where wildlife could annihilate a village in a single footstep."

Perhaps most importantly, though, is that they are fast enough to chase down anything we have encountered out here so far."`

Several technicians cling to the ceiling overhead as they install new conduit. Despite the busy atmosphere, people frequently stop to glance out the windows, and a flutter of gestures break out whenever someone spots a void sprite. Seeing how busy it is, you understand the traffic controller's request that you refrain from taking up a berth for longer than necessary.`

And they came with enough firepower to make life miserable for everyone. We only had a few scouts in the area, so we stayed hidden and bargained. In the end, they gave us some 'inconsequential' data, and they got an hour to explore the station and take a few loose items.

And it was doubly distressing for them that, despite their impressive scanner arrays, they were not able to even catch the slightest emission that might hint at where or who we were." Gavriil pauses as they palm open a door to pull the loaded lift through, then continues.

The set even includes data that likely corresponds to the destruction of some of their worlds during their civil war." They pause, then continue. "Of course, we need to verify the data first.

She runs her hand along the ship, obviously quite smooth and solid. "Liveships, as we are calling them, are spaceships that have a sufficient degree of self-awareness and self-control to be deemed alive. They are manufactured and have energy and fuel requirements just like any other ship. Likewise, they are largely made of materials similar to what you are familiar with. But they are conscious. They can move and flex in ways that would be impossible to precisely control with servos and traditional position reporting. They can feel where each tendril is as surely as most people can tell where their hand is, and each ripple of a wormhole vortex is as perceptible to them as the crest of a sand dune would be to you or I."`
			`	She turns to you and pulls up a display, listing off various statistics. "From a technical standpoint, the Peregrine class starship is classified as a medium warship, built along the lines of the fast-attack cruisers from earlier eras. While it does not have the thickest armor or shields we could have installed, it makes up for it in unrivaled mobility and a neural system that has been hardened against some of the effects that could slow it down. It is also, so far, the largest production ship that has built-in cloaking."`
			`As if on cue, the ship vanishes from sight. There is a brief rustle and a whoosh of air, and the ship reappears on the other side of you. Several of the Remnant working on it look amused, then relocate to continue their tasks. Taely gestures amusement as well and continues. "Given your recent work with Plume, it may also be relevant to you that the Peregrine is what we term a 'gaslined' starship; meaning it is built to not only fly in atmosphere but also handle both the pressure and conditions found in the depths of gas giants and other high-pressure worlds."`

			`	Taely smiles, and continues. "You should be able to take off shortly, but Chilia does have some final comments on this mission."`

			`When you contact <planet> to confirm where to unload your cargo you are greeted by Dusk, who directs you to a docking bay closer to the main reactor. As you open the hatch, though, it is Gavriil and a group of Remnant with lifters waiting. They welcome you cheerfully, but they definitely seem in a rush to get the processed fuel unloaded and shuttled into the depths of the station. Once the last unit is off your ship, Gavriil slows down enough to thank you for the prompt delivery, but apologizes as they rush off as there is not much time left. Their parting gesture suggests you talk to Dusk up in the control room.`

			`Up in the control station Dusk and a small team of Remnant are busily working at a bunch of consoles. Alarms blink and are quickly dealt with, only to have new ones appear elsewhere. There is so much motion that it seems like there are twice as many of them. From a glance at the readings, it appears you brought the shipment of fuel just in time: the Aeon Cell is overloaded trying to take over for the fusion reactor, and most of their efforts have been directed toward carefully orchestrating rolling brown outs across the systems to keep everything minimally functional.`
			`	Gavriil suddenly appears on a viewscreen, gesturing that the fuel injection process has begun, and Dusk anxiously scans a number of readings. There is a moment of stillness, then readings suddenly start to climb. The Remnant quickly recalibrate their sensors to the larger volumes of power being handled, and the readings continue to push the top of the charts upwards. Section by section, whole banks of indicators flicker and fade out. A minute or two later, and the last display ceases to indicate any problems remaining in the power grid.`
			`	Dusk turns towards you and the team with a satisfied gesture just beginning when there is a sudden shift as if everything had just went sideways. You almost feel like you can see a brief ripple, but it vanishes before you can focus on it. You are left with a feeling that something has changed. At the same time, the proximity sensors and systems monitoring the surrounding system light up. Someone looks up from a console. "The system is alive, Dusk! All those ghost life signs we were picking up just became much more solid!" Another gestures in clipped, fast tones. "And we have several large masses that have appeared as well. They look to be planetary in scale, but the readings seem to indicate something a bit more nebulous."`

			`Just like the Remnant said, the system appears to be full of life. Where once there was just asteroids and a fairly empty system, there is now life signs everywhere. As you dodge among the asteroids, you note that most of them appear to have something growing on them: plants. Moss or fungus might be a better word, although you are fairly certain that nothing in the current classifications of life can adequately categorize what you can see outside. The sudden appearance of all this life is only compounded when your sensors light up to notify you that it is tracking several flocks of void sprites.`
			`	As you move away from the station you continue to spot signs of life and activity everywhere: flitting among the rocks, soaring along the solar winds, and hunting amongst clouds. What is unclear, however, is where it came from. The only hint might be in the fact that your ship instruments report a sudden spike in the ambient energy in the surrounding area.`

			`Back on the station Dusk, Gavriil, and many of the Remnant on the station meet you in the docking bay. Dusk and several of the others just came back from walking out on the hull of <origin>, and they report seeing void sprites passing close to the station. They quickly pull the data from your ship sensors and throw it up on a holographic display. Everyone gathers around, intently drinking in the data and footage. They stand, stare, and ponder with intense concentration as the data continues to stream in from the station.`
			`	Without warning, something clicks in your mind. Suddenly there is a hum of hundreds of conversations crowding your thoughts and a momentary feeling of seeing the system through thousands of eyes. You feel a wave of curiosity, and a glimpse of <origin> as it might have been once - shiny and gleaming. The image ages like a fast-forward video of untold thousands of orbits as the station wears and the sky changes around it. Then the image freezes on what appears to be the present day. A feeling of appreciation replaces the sense of curiosity, followed by a blurry image of the <ship> leaving the station and heading in a dozen different directions simultaneously, as if watching it splinter into ghosts.`
			`	The final image is of the creature the Remnant termed the "Ember Node," floating in space. The image splinters the same way as the image of your ship, and fragments into multiple ghosts of itself that vanish into a rift of energy. The sense of curiosity returns, and then there is a another click, and suddenly your mind is your own once again.`

Go do a sweep through each of the surrounding systems, and see if you can get a signal to any of the Remnant worlds. Our communicators have all lost connection, as have the isolated backups.

			`Back in the control room the Remnant appear to have regained their composure. Remnant move quickly from station to station, and every sensor and tool is in use. It is as if the Remnant are afraid everything is going to vanish any moment. Which, you realize, might actually happen. You find Gavriil carefully tending a console, and they look up as you approach. "The Embers guided you back, I see. How does the outside world fare?"`
			`	They listen intently as you described your flight through the surrounding systems, and nods when you mention that your navigation system is reporting no connections to the rest of the Ember Waste. Even predictions as to jump drive performance indicate no valid jumps.`
			`	"No connections whatsoever?" Gavriil looks thoughtful. "That actually makes sense." They gesture at a display of the area. "As best our sensors can pick up, the universe beyond this pocket of the Ember Waste just does not exist."`
			`	They quickly continue. "Of course, we can see it out there. But it is like looking through a very thin film." Gavriil looks thoughtful. "The current leading theory is that we are in some kind of dimensional bubble. A pocket dimension of sorts. But we have not yet reached a consensus."`
			choice
				`	"What happened to us? Did we all see the same thing?"`
				`	"Where did those feelings and images come from?"`
			`	Gavriil frowns in thought. "Based on our initial survey, each person had a slightly different experience. We think that everyone had basically the same event, but as it was a series of impressions, images, and feelings, each person picked up on different aspects of it."`
			`	Their gestures take on a confident tone. "Which makes sense, since our life experiences shape our perceptions. Still, as to what it was..." They pause, gathering their thoughts. "Our best guess is that this was first contact with some sort of entity." They grin at that. "I know, stating the obvious. But anyway, Dusk thinks that it might be some sort of solitary entity, as it did not use words or meanings, despite having access to our minds. As such, it uses internals to convey meaning instead of words." They glance at a map of the system. "There is, however, no indication as to where it came from.`

			`	"Everything looks in perfect working order. The only problem is that the quantum pairs at the heart just do not seem to have a pair anymore. In terms of quantum mechanics, it seems that the rest of the universe quite simply does not exist."`
			choice
				`	"That seems problematic. How do we get back?"`
					goto cutpower
				`	"Did we destroy the universe by powering up this station?"`
			`	Gavriil smiles with amusement. "It is certainly a possibility. However, the fact that it was, as best we can tell, powered up previously without destroying the universe suggests that it transported or isolated us rather than destroying everything else."`
			`	They frown at the communication panel. "Although everything I know about quantum mechanics refuses to countenance something being able to leave the universe so absolutely like this." They smile again. "But that is the way of science! Finding new things in the universe that tells us that what we know is not so absolute."`
			choice
				`	"I think we should focus on getting back."`
					goto cutpower
				`	"Should we be worried?"`
			`	Gavriil gestures neutrally. "Well, I am worried, of course. I would be devastated to find out I had destroyed humanity, and everything else in existence." They look somber, but then perk up again. "But if everything has been annihilated, there is nothing I can do about it. So I shall focus on learning what I can, doing what must be done, and enjoy the fact that the universe has inexplicably revealed once again that the sum of all our knowledge is merely the introductory metaphor to help us grasp how things work." Their gestures abruptly change tone. "Speaking of which, we need to report what we have learned to the rest, which means leaving this place."`
			label cutpower
			`	Gavriil gestures at the control panel in front of them. "I do not know for sure, but based on events, I suspect that if we manually induce a power failure we should be able to reverse the process that transported us to this realm." They smile eagerly. "I have everything all set up, and we have people waiting across the station." They look confident. "We think that we can safely spin down the reactor and cut power across a number of these arrays in a controlled fashion. This should replicate the original power failure, except with fewer risks and less damage to the system."`
			`	They leads you over to a panel in the main loading dock. "I know, it says 'Job Board' on it. I re-used the coding for our task list to improvise this mass-notification system." They smile in amusement. "When you are ready to go, just select the 'De-activate Array' option from the panel. That will notify everyone and begin the shutdown."`
			`	They hand you a data crystal, and then a large case. "Here is an encrypted data crystal of all our data so far. The case has several sets, with the data stored in a variety of different mechanisms and encryptions. We do not know what happens when the station is activated or deactivated, so multiple formats for storing the data will give a better chance that at least some of it will remain intact to be delivered."`
			`	They step back. "Well, I will return to the controls. Just give the signal when you are ready to leave. Embers light your path, Captain <first>."`

			`	"To put it simply, we can form ad-hoc neural networks between us, of varying levels of intensity. Without the necessity of speech or gestures, we can have entire conversations in the blink of an eye."`
			`	He gestures confidently. "A team of Remnant, for instance, could all review incoming data from an experiment, form their own analysis, and then hold what amounts to a conference where each fully presents their thoughts and ideas with supporting data and reasoning within the span of a few minutes."`
