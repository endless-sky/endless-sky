			`This planet is populated by an alien species that resemble giant, intelligent squirrels. However, the most surprising aspect of the spaceport is not the aliens, but the fact that human merchants and other civilians are walking among them and are clearly at home here. Would you like to find someone who can tell you what is going on here?`
			choice
				`	(Sure.)`
				`	(Not right now.)`
					defer
			
			`	You walk up to a human merchant who is busy haggling with one of the aliens. They interrupt their conversation when they see you approaching, and the human gestures for you to join them. "You look totally lost," he says. "First time down the rabbit hole?"`
			`	You nod. The alien reaches out a paw to shake hands with you. "Welcome to Hai space," it says. "We are people of peace, and you are free to visit us or even live among us. Our worlds provide enough bounty for all."`
			`	You glance quickly at the human merchant to see his expression, wondering if these aliens can indeed be so benign, but his expression is calm and untroubled. "It's true," he says, "look around you. These buildings have stood for thousands of years. Hai society is so advanced, they need almost no resources to maintain it."`
			choice
				`	"Why do you allow humans to settle here?"`
				`	"What do you ask for in return for letting humans settle here?"`
			
			`	"Humans are a young species," the Hai says, "full of energy, full of new ideas. And the Hai are old, and everything we do is what we have done before. When humans go on vacation, they travel to a world with perfect weather, sunny every day. When Hai go on vacation, we visit the stormiest world, to find unpredictability and change. Humans are so strange, that to speak with a human is like a small vacation." It smiles, and you catch a glimpse of its massive incisors. Based on your knowledge of xenobiology you would guess that the Hai are herbivores, but you can't be certain.`
			choice
				`	"So I'm allowed to travel throughout your territory if I want?"`
					goto travel
				`	"How come people back in human space don't know that you are here?"`
			
			`	The human merchant laughs. "Probably because most of us came here to escape from the chaos and fighting in human space. The last thing we want is for it to follow us here. Not that I'm saying you can't tell anyone about the wormhole, but if I were you I wouldn't go telling just anyone. But take a look around Hai space before you leave; you'll find that we could learn a lot from them."`
			`	"So I can travel anywhere I want in your territory?" you ask the Hai.`
			
			label travel
			`	"Yes," it says, "but be careful. The north is the territory of some renegade Hai: bandits and pirates, living off what they steal from the rest of us. If you travel among them, you will not be safe."`
			`	You talk for a while longer, but do not gain much additional information except that several of their worlds are willing to sell Hai technology even to human beings. You thank them both for stopping to talk with you, and the Hai responds, "We are always glad to welcome new friends. May peace dwell in your heart until we meet again."`

			choice
				`(Sure.)`
				`(Not now, it's too risky.)`
					defer
			`	You catch the eye of one of the Hai dock workers and it walks over. "Ah," it says, "the monkey is curious. The monkey has never been face to face with a true Hai before?"`

			label masters
			choice
				`	"Where was your territory? Why have I never heard of you before?"`
				`	"What do you mean, the Hai were altered?"`
	
			`	"This is our story," it says. "Once, many worlds beyond wormhole were ours. Once, million years now gone. We needed more worlds. A species that does not expand becomes like brackish water, like stunted tree. But dragonfolk in the south had created hyperdrive, and human monkeys had begun banging rocks together in what the Drak said was very intelligent fashion. So we were forbidden from taking more worlds."`
			`	"'Dragonfolk?'" you ask. "I've never heard of them."`
			`	"Sheragi," it says, "they are extinct. Only their dumb ancestors survive, just as monkeys will outlast the thinking humans."`
			`	"How were you altered?" you ask.`
			`	It says, "We Hai took worlds that Drak said belonged to Sheragi, although Sheragi had not yet even discovered them. Drak retaliated. On all Hai words, Drak ships appeared in orbit. Sickness swept each planet: quick fever, strange feeling of frailness, like you are brittle bones with mouth full of dirt. Victims left alive, but all ambition gone, no desire but to die of comfortable old age."`
			choice
				`	"Did you try to resist the Drak?"`
					goto resist
				`	"How do you know this, if it happened millions of years ago?"`
					goto know
			
			label resist
			`	"Silly monkey," it says, "none can resist. They are strong. Their will prevails. And their will is for the galaxy to be a zoo, little remnants of each species all in separate cages. For now they let humans run free so humans will grow in knowledge, but soon they will fashion a cage for humans too."`
				goto help
			
			label know
			`	"All Hai know. The story is passed down. Others tell an altered version, where the way of peace was choice and not an inflicted wound, but some in each generation learn truth, and join us here."`

				`	"That is a frightening story. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me."`

				`	"Is there anything I can do to help you?"`

			choice
				`	"I'm sorry, I don't know the secret of the jump drive. No human being does."`
				`	"If I ever have an extra jump drive to sell, I will bring it to you."`
					goto sell
			`	"Then leave us alone," it says, and it walks off.`
				decline
