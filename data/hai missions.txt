			`This planet is populated by an alien species that resemble giant, intelligent squirrels. However, the most surprising aspect of the spaceport is not the aliens, but the fact that human merchants and other civilians are walking among them and are clearly at home here. Would you like to find someone who can tell you what is going on here?`
			choice
				`	(Sure.)`
				`	(Not right now.)`
					defer
			
			`	You walk up to a human merchant who is busy haggling with one of the aliens. They interrupt their conversation when they see you approaching, and the human gestures for you to join them. "You look totally lost," he says. "First time down the rabbit hole?"`
			`	You nod. The alien reaches out a paw to shake hands with you. "Welcome to Hai space," it says. "We are people of peace, and you are free to visit us or even live among us. Our worlds provide enough bounty for all."`
			`	You glance quickly at the human merchant to see his expression, wondering if these aliens can indeed be so benign, but his expression is calm and untroubled. "It's true," he says, "look around you. These buildings have stood for thousands of years. Hai society is so advanced, they need almost no resources to maintain it."`
			choice
				`	"Why do you allow humans to settle here?"`
				`	"What do you ask for in return for letting humans settle here?"`
			
			`	"Humans are a young species," the Hai says, "full of energy, full of new ideas. And the Hai are old, and everything we do is what we have done before. When humans go on vacation, they travel to a world with perfect weather, sunny every day. When Hai go on vacation, we visit the stormiest world, to find unpredictability and change. Humans are so strange, that to speak with a human is like a small vacation." It smiles, and you catch a glimpse of its massive incisors. Based on your knowledge of xenobiology you would guess that the Hai are herbivores, but you can't be certain.`
			choice
				`	"So I'm allowed to travel throughout your territory if I want?"`
					goto travel
				`	"How come people back in human space don't know that you are here?"`
			
			`	The human merchant laughs. "Probably because most of us came here to escape from the chaos and fighting in human space. The last thing we want is for it to follow us here. Not that I'm saying you can't tell anyone about the wormhole, but if I were you I wouldn't go spreading the news too widely either. And take a look around Hai space before you leave; you'll find that we could learn a lot from them."`
			`	"So I can travel anywhere I want in your territory?" you ask the Hai.`
			
			label travel
			`	"Yes," it says, "but be careful. The north is the territory of some renegade Hai: bandits and pirates, living off what they steal from the rest of us. If you travel among them, you will not be safe."`
			`	You talk for a while longer, but do not gain much additional information except that several of their worlds are willing to sell Hai technology even to human beings. You thank them both for stopping to talk with you, and the Hai responds, "We are always glad to welcome new friends. May peace dwell in your heart until we meet again."`

A species that does not expand becomes like brackish water, like stunted tree. But dragonfolk in the south had created hyperdrive, and human monkeys had begun banging rocks together in what the Drak said was very intelligent fashion. So we were forbidden from taking more worlds."`

Sickness swept each planet: quick fever, strange feeling of frailness, like you are brittle bones with mouth full of dirt. Victims left alive, but all ambition gone, no desire but to die of comfortable old age."`

For now they let humans run free so humans will grow in knowledge, but soon they will fashion a cage for humans too."`

They are not our enemies, they are just those who do not fit in. You have surely seen what our society is like: safe, stable, predictable, deliberate. It suits most of us well. But there are those..."`
			label raids
			`	He pauses. "No, I am telling this unfairly. I will start again. Hundreds of years ago, when I was young, our territory was raided by aliens from the east, who came in massive warships and plundered our worlds. In those days there were some Hai who were brave enough to risk their lives to defend us. The raids lasted for decades, then abruptly stopped.`
			`	"Most of those who had fought the invaders were glad to return to ordinary life, but there were some for whom life now seemed bland and meaningless without the excitement and chaos of war. They started colonies in the systems to the north, and fought amongst themselves, and mismanaged the land, and grew in numbers. And now their worlds cannot feed them all, and they invade us and tell stories to put blame on us for their failures."`

			`	"They were, and still should be. There will always be times when our society needs them. Only at this time, the need is not so great. There is no new frontier for them to explore, no worthy challenges for them to face. And we fear what would happen if they ventured south and gained access to the wormhole, so we must force them to stay where they are."`
			choice
				`	"They said the Drak altered the Hai to make them less aggressive. Is that true?"`
				`	"That's all I wanted to know. Thanks."`
					decline
			label drak
			`	"No," he says, "it is a story they invented, that the Hai were destined to be masters of the galaxy but the Drak and the Quarg prevented us. The story is not true. Our civilization beyond the wormhole was brought down by infighting and unwise governance. Amid the wreckage we studied and thought and argued and came to believe that we could rule a small territory with stability and peace, or hold more worlds but with constant turmoil. We chose stability, and relinquished those worlds."`
			choice
				`	"So you don't think the Drak are keeping us all in cages?"`
				`	"That's all I wanted to know. Thanks."`
					decline
			`	He thinks about the question for a while, then says, "Sometimes we make a fire for cooking food. The fire consumes much wood, and the flames are tall, too wild and hot to cook food well. Then the wood becomes coals that burn slowly with no flames or smoke, and when you gather them they are good for roasting meat or even baking bread. Perhaps each species must consume many worlds and many resources before learning to burn slowly, and the wisdom of the Drak is to allow them to do so. But when they find balance, as we did, they no longer need so much space."`
			`	You thank him for taking time to speak with you, and say goodbye.`

			`When you are coming into landing on Vara K'chrai, you radio ahead and ask Sayari, the Hai ambassador, and Iktat Ret, the Wanderer envoy, to meet you when you land.`
			`	When you step out of your ship you find a larger group of Wanderers, some armed, than you where you expecting. Ret comes hurrying up behind them. "Sorry <first>, one of the ships in orbit detectid a Hai [stowaway, passenger] on-board your ship. We..." Ret stops talking when Eruk appears behind you.`
			choice
				`	(Let Eruk explain)`
					goto explain
				`	(Try to explain)`

			`	"Eruk had an idea, he wants to improve his speaking machine to handle your language." Eruk stops you and starts explaining himself.`

			label explain
			`	He tells the Wanderers everything he told you and more. It seems he has thought of everything from data sets to time frames and processing power to memory space. When he finishes, the Wanderers start to talk among themselves in their own chirping, clicking language getting louder and faster all the time.`
			`	Ret moves towards you, Sayari and Eruk. "They can't [decide, agree] what to do, some think we should [stop, decline] his request and send him back to Hai space and others think we should [support?, care?, help?] him outright, the rest have every view inbetween."`
			choice
				`	(Wait it out)`
					goto wait
				`	"Can't you make the decision?"`

			`	"No, I only have [authority, command] concerning Human [visitors, travelers]. They came to deal with any Hai so they make the decision." It looks like you have no choice but to wait for them to finish.`

			label wait
			`	When the hubub has quieted down a little one of the unarmed Wanderers steps out of the croud and proclames (rather grandly) "Hai Eruk and Human <first>, you are to go before the Assembly to determine the validity of Hai Eruk's request of the Wanderers. Hai Eruk you will be kept under guard until such time it is deemed unnecessary." And with that most of the Wanderers fly off leaving just Ret, the two armed guards, Sayari and Eruk on your ship's landing pad.`
			`	"What where you thinking?!" Sayari says, rounding on Eruk.`
			`	"I needed someone to get me here, and I  knew you woulden't agree to it so I asked Captian <last> to bring me here."`
			choice
				`	(keep out of it)`
					goto "keeping out"
				`	"Eruk said you agreed to it."`
					goto sayari
				`	"You lied to me!"`
					goto eruk

			label "keeping out"
			`	"So instead you go behind my back, undermine our position and shater any work towards a closer relationship betwen the Hai and the Wanderers. You would jeopardise everything I have worked for to meet your ends?"`
			`	"<first>, why did you bring him here?" You are thankful that she isn't shouting at you.`
			`	"Eruk said you agreed to it."`

			label sayari
			`	"Did he now? Well I hope he's proud of the diplomatic incident he caused." Sayari says, storming off.`
				goto ret

			label eruk
			`	Eruk looks appolgetic and is about to speak before Sayari interupts. "You lied for your own gain? I thought you where brought up better than this!" Sayari says, storming off.`

			label ret
			`	Ret looks surprised but recovers quickly "You should head over to the Assembly building," he says pointing at a building that looks vaguely like a giant birds nest, "I won't be [allowed, permitted] to stay, so I need to find you an interpreter." Ret flies off as well.`
			`	Eruk starts walking away from your ship and towards the Assembly building with the Wanderer guards following close behind.`
			choice
				`	(follow him)`
					goto assembly
				`	(try to comfort him)`

			`	You hurry after him, but when you catch up he simply angrily waves you away. You resign yourself to simply following him.`

			label assembly
			`	When you reach the Assembly building, you notice large numbers of Wanderers flying into it to through an open roof. You can't help but notice that there are no visible doors on the side of the building.`
			`	Eruk sighs and goes to sit down on a nearby wall while you start to walk around the edge of the building looking for a door.`
			`	After going nearly the entire way round the building you find Iktat Ret and another slightly smaller Wanderer standing by the only door you've seen thus far. Eruk is also with them, but he doesn't seem to be any happier than before.`
			`	"<first>, this is my child Iktat Kri. [He?, She?] will be able to [understand, interpret] for you."`
			`	You realise that you've never seen a female Wanderer, but maybe Wanderer society does not differentiate between male and female in the same way Hai and Human societies do, and the quite opposite of what is done in the Syndicate.`
			`	Iktat Ret wishes Eruk luck before indicating that you should follow Iktat Kri inside.`
			`	Inside the building looks even more like a bird's nest, with hundreds of balconies scattered chaotically around the inside of the large bowl-shaped structure. All of the balconies are full apart from a few at the very top of the bowl, but even these are filled quickly as the last couple of Wanderers fly in.`
			`	The half-dozen or so lowest balconies are filled with some very old looking Wanderers, that must be the actual Wanderer government officials as you can't help but feel that any debate between the number of Wanderer that are currently occupying the building would take so long that it would be completely pointless.`
			`	Once all the Wanderers have settled down and the last rustling of wings has ceased, one of the old Wanderers sitting in front of you leans forward and asks Eruk, with Iktat Kri translating, to tell them about his proposition.`
			`	Eruk once again explains what he wants to do and how he needs the Wanderers help to do it.`
			`	When he's finished the wanderer turns to you and asks "<first>, what is your [thought, opinion] on this?"`
			choice
				`	"I think this would facilitate better trade and relationship between your species and our two species."`
				`	"This would be an excellent first step towards interspecies communication and peace."`
				`	"I do not feel that I am qualified to make a judgement.`

			`	"A [exceptional, excellent] point. Thank you <first>."`
			`	The Wanderer officials occupying the lowest balconies start talking in their own language in what appears to be a debate, but whatever it is it seems much more organised than what you had to deal with on your landing pad.`
			`	Iktat Kri explains that the debate is held in public so as to allow any Wanderer who is interested to listen, and in some cases, to raise points of their own.`
			` Eruk pulls you away from Iktat Kri slightly and says quietly to you,"If this goes through, I'll need to stay in Wanderer space for a year or so to collect the data that I need. Would you be able to come back afterwards to pick me up and take me back to Greenwater?"`
			choice
				`	"I will do if I can."`

			`	Just as Eruk thanks you, the Wanderers quieten down again as if they have come to a decision. The same Wanderer as before speaks to Eruk, "We have decided to [assist, help] to improve your..." he hesitates, "speaking machine. We will offer you any [required, necessary] help that you need. You can stay with ambassador Sayari, you will not be guarded, and a interpreter will be [listed, assigned] to you." The speech over, the Wanderers start flocking into the air r to continue their day-to-day business.`
			`	Eruk turns to you now a much happier Hai, and hands you a 200,000 credit chip. He thanks you excitedly as Iktat Ret lands near you, before setting off on foot with Iktat Kri and Eruk who is now talking enthusiastically about how he wants to start the next day. With the excitement over you decide to head back to your ship.`
