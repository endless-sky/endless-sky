			`This planet is populated by an alien species that resemble giant, intelligent squirrels. However, the most surprising aspect of the spaceport is not the aliens, but the fact that human merchants and other civilians are walking among them and are clearly at home here. Would you like to find someone who can tell you what is going on here?`
			choice
				`	(Sure.)`
				`	(Not right now.)`
					defer
			
			`	You walk up to a human merchant who is busy haggling with one of the aliens. They interrupt their conversation when they see you approaching, and the human gestures for you to join them. "You look totally lost," he says. "First time down the rabbit hole?"`
			`	You nod. The alien reaches out a paw to shake hands with you. "Welcome to Hai space," it says. "We are people of peace, and you are free to visit us or even live among us. Our worlds provide enough bounty for all."`
			`	You glance quickly at the human merchant to see his expression, wondering if these aliens can indeed be so benign, but his expression is calm and untroubled. "It's true," he says, "look around you. These buildings have stood for thousands of years. Hai society is so advanced, they need almost no resources to maintain it."`
			choice
				`	"Why do you allow humans to settle here?"`
				`	"What do you ask for in return for letting humans settle here?"`
			
			`	"Humans are a young species," the Hai says, "full of energy, full of new ideas. And the Hai are old, and everything we do is what we have done before. When humans go on vacation, they travel to a world with perfect weather, sunny every day. When Hai go on vacation, we visit the stormiest world, to find unpredictability and change. Humans are so strange, that to speak with a human is like a small vacation." It smiles, and you catch a glimpse of its massive incisors. Based on your knowledge of xenobiology you would guess that the Hai are herbivores, but you can't be certain.`
			choice
				`	"So I'm allowed to travel throughout your territory if I want?"`
					goto travel
				`	"How come people back in human space don't know that you are here?"`
			
			`	The human merchant laughs. "Probably because most of us came here to escape from the chaos and fighting in human space. The last thing we want is for it to follow us here. Not that I'm saying you can't tell anyone about the wormhole, but if I were you I wouldn't go spreading the news too widely either. And take a look around Hai space before you leave; you'll find that we could learn a lot from them."`
			`	"So I can travel anywhere I want in your territory?" you ask the Hai.`
			
			label travel
			`	"Yes," it says, "but be careful. The north is the territory of some renegade Hai: bandits and pirates, living off what they steal from the rest of us. If you travel among them, you will not be safe."`
			`	You talk for a while longer, but do not gain much additional information except that several of their worlds are willing to sell Hai technology even to human beings. You thank them both for stopping to talk with you, and the Hai responds, "We are always glad to welcome new friends. May peace dwell in your heart until we meet again."`

A species that does not expand becomes like brackish water, like stunted tree. But dragonfolk in the south had created hyperdrive, and human monkeys had begun banging rocks together in what the Drak said was very intelligent fashion. So we were forbidden from taking more worlds."`

But there are those..."`

Hundreds of years ago, when I was young, our territory was raided by aliens from the east, who came in massive warships and plundered our worlds. In those days there were some Hai who were brave enough to risk their lives to defend us. The raids lasted for decades, then abruptly stopped.`
			`	"Most of those who had fought the invaders were glad to return to ordinary life, but there were some for whom life now seemed bland and meaningless without the excitement and chaos of war. They started colonies in the systems to the north, and fought amongst themselves, and mismanaged the land, and grew in numbers. And now their worlds cannot feed them all, and they invade us and tell stories to put blame on us for their failures."`

There is no new frontier for them to explore, no worthy challenges for them to face. And we fear what would happen if they ventured south and gained access to the wormhole, so we must force them to stay where they are."`

					decline
			label drak
			`	"No," he says, "it is a story they invented, that the Hai were destined to be masters of the galaxy but the Drak and the Quarg prevented us. The story is not true. Our civilization beyond the wormhole was brought down by infighting and unwise governance. Amid the wreckage we studied and thought and argued and came to believe that we could rule a small territory with stability and peace, or hold more worlds but with constant turmoil. We chose stability, and relinquished those worlds."`

				`	"So you don't think the Drak are keeping us all in cages?"`
				`	"That's all I wanted to know. Thanks."`
					decline
			`	He thinks about the question for a while, then says, "Sometimes we make a fire for cooking food. The fire consumes much wood, and the flames are tall, too wild and hot to cook food well. Then the wood becomes coals that burn slowly with no flames or smoke, and when you gather them they are good for roasting meat or even baking bread. Perhaps each species must consume many worlds and many resources before learning to burn slowly, and the wisdom of the Drak is to allow them to do so. But when they find balance, as we did, they no longer need so much space."`
