	description "The Anro needed a long time for this weapon but in the end they created an electromagnetic gun that denses the projectile until it gets to a black hole. When the blackhole is fired away it is guided by a very precise system of electromagnetic fields and it will follow its target until it either hit it or the blackhole dies."
