# Since mission NPCs will fill up on cargo, they should always be given the
# `uninterested` personality, at least until there is a way to tell an NPC to
# travel to a planet after it fills up on cargo (rather than follow the player).
# A random condition is given in the `to fail` to ensure active competition
# missions actually offer competition for minables. Note that this condition
# is checked twice before the mission is active when offered.

# Competition for mining jobs in human space. Will not follow the player around.
