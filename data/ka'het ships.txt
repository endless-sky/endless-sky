	description "The Maeri is the smallest Het ship created by the Builders' stations, a prime example of the genetic technology they once possessed. Its small size is compensated by the fact that it can hide its location from most types of sensors."

	description "When the Builders designed the exoskeleton of the Telis, they came to the conclusion that it would have been impossible to make it resilient enough without compromising its agility and integrity. Instead, they focused heavily on improving their shield technology, giving the Telis many of their regenerators."
