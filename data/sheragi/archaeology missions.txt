			`	"Go on," says the archaeologist.`
			`	"However," says the lab tech, "again assuming the two samples are from the same planet, the second sample is between fifteen hundred and twenty-five hundred years old.

The houses are built on a gargantuan scale, with most of the doorways at least ten meters tall. What's more, some of the buildings have no exterior doors on the street level, just doors facing balconies or inner courtyards, which supports the theory that the inhabitants were capable of flight. Most of the artifacts left behind are just everyday items, and in fact the technology seems less advanced than present human society, but scientists are studying the artifacts eagerly to glean hints about how these aliens lived.`
			`	The Quarg, who at other times seem quite willing to share their knowledge with human beings, are being surprisingly reticent with information about this lost civilization. Aside from telling Foster that the aliens were known as the Sheragi, their only comments have been vague warnings that if human beings persist in developing weapons of war, they will end up like the Sheragi. From this, Foster has surmised that the alien civilization was most likely destroyed by a civil war, not by natural disaster or an attack by another species.`

One of our interns suggested we survey deeper underground, to check for military facilities or bunkers, even though our previous scans didn't show anything interesting, so we allowed her to play around with the ground-penetrating radar. And wouldn't you believe it, there were some angled pieces of metal under the dirt. Clearly man-made. Well... Sheragi-made, in this case. So we dug deeper, and found what we can only assume to have been a bunker, showing signs of having been hit by a powerful kinetic weapon. Despite the damage, we could still salvage some artifacts from the debris. Particularly, this thing."`

There are pictures of Sheragi military officials of the time, as well as their names and roles. Details on their culture, their biology, and their apparent conflicts with the Hai are provided as well. There is a huge statue of a bipedal dragon at the center of the room, around 8 meters tall, so large that the ceiling had to be raised. The inscription on the plaque at its feet indicates it is a reproduction of a life-sized Sheragi. A smaller interactive holographic display of one shows details on their biology and behavior. Samples of culture are scarce, but it indicates that they lived under a military meritocracy that valued strength and leadership above all else.`
			`	You see pictures and rough blueprints of their ships, some depicting fearsome fleets of massive warships. They had angular, multi-layered armor that rivaled the strength of modern Hai vessels by sheer mass. If your measurement conversions are correct, their ships were bigger than anything else in human space, dwarfing even the Navy Carrier. A few of them display equally impressive spinal cannons of unknown capability, with grim descriptions suggesting that they were responsible for the extinction of the Sheragi - weapons of mass destruction in the hands of a warlike and immature species that used them carelessly.`
			`	While you are looking around the room, one of the curators approaches you, speaking your own language, albeit with a heavy accent.`

			`	"I would like to know more about Sheragi computers," you respond.`
			`	"Hmmm, computers. The Sheragi built their hardware to last. Very sturdy electronics with redundancies, designed to be able to take a shot and survive. But still, I doubt they would have survived so many thousand years. If you want to identify how their hardware used to work, there are a few documents and manuals the ancient Hai stole from them."`

You're surprised to find Eyama wearing long, dark but colorful human clothing with an equally oversized hoodie and a bandanna. You recognize this outfit, very popular with the youth these days, who are generally regarded as delinquents by the previous generation.

You arrive at the museum and they immediately break character by being very obviously excited to see the exhibits. This probably comes as a relief to onlookers, however, who would normally expect that type of kid to vandalize priceless artifacts.`
			`	Finally, you arrive at Albert's workshop. He stops brushing layers of hardened soil off of an object that looks like it was once a television, and looks startled at you and the three "kids." The Hai take off their hoods and bandannas, causing his jaw to nearly drop to the floor.`

On the final moments of the recording, a large transport fleet had entered the system, unarmed ships. They were followed by military vessels in pursuit. There's no telling what they thought at the time, but a military fleet was immediately dispatched to eliminate both fleets. One particular ship, the name of which Eyama has translated as 'Emerald Sword,' started behaving erratically when given orders. It fired and missed a few shots until it eventually stopped and fled. Clear signs of a mutiny. However, what is perhaps most interesting is that when it fled, it fled in an unexpected direction, away from any hyperlanes."`
			`	Albert continues, "We think they wanted to flee from the fighting. These were soldiers scarred by the horrors of the war, and they just got ordered to attack what we assume to be refugees. The Emerald Sword was a big ship, likely with an equally large crew, and from the movement data, its engines were very powerful too, possibly capable of crossing interstellar distances within a Sheragi lifetime. This has some interesting implications. The ship was moving precisely towards a star named Zubenelhakrabi. Not significant enough to show up in the star maps, but we did our survey, and there is a potentially habitable planet there, but zero signs of intelligent life. We think they failed in colonizing it, but the ship might still be there. It's a priceless artifact. We can't know for sure until we get there. Thing is, there is no way to do so."`

			`	You also find the Emerald Sword, but strangely, it is not on the planet, but drifting through space. An enormous ship of angular design, its most striking feature is an incredibly large cannon going through the center of the ship. It is so large the ship might as well have been built around it; you can only wonder about its power. Thankfully, you won't have to find out the hard way; the ship is inert, derelict, ruined from lack of maintenance, and abandoned to the mercy of micrometeorite showers and decay. It seems like it could fall apart if looked at the wrong way... luckily, you have just the right crew for the job.`
			`	But before you can initiate the approach to the ship, a strange feeling washes over you. First, a feeling of being watched by something far greater. Then, a void in your chest, a deep apprehension you can't shake. A thought forms in your mind, but it's not your own:`

Show your respect to those who have perished here, learn their lessons, and I will allow it. Perhaps the sight of that vessel will remind the living races of those who have come and gone... and how, despite their great accomplishments, their decision to make war reduced them to graveyards, relics, memories... and dust."`

			`	You find Foster in a room that appears to have been expanded beyond its original size and converted into a farming facility of some sort. There are rows of dried out soil, its nutrients long gone, with sunlamps suspended above. While most of the crew with Foster is busy studying the farm itself, his attention seems to be on a mummified Sheragi corpse slumped over against one of the walls. You notice that the corpse has a prosthetic wing attached to it, which has survived far better than its host.`
			`	"What have you found so far?" you ask Foster.`
			`	Foster doesn't respond at first, so you begin to ask your question again, but he then turns quickly to look at you, then back at the corpse. "Sorry, I was busy daydreaming. What we found.

Given that the Emerald Sword had to be able to survive the long flight through interstellar space at sublight speeds, it's no surprise that the crew had to make the ship self-sustaining. I'm sure there's much we could learn technologically from this ship. But we've also found many... disturbing things..." his voice trails off again.`
			`	"These bodies tell stories, <last>. Terrible stories. The entrance into this area of the ship was welded shut. Almost all the corpses outside of this area were skeletons, while those inside, like this one, were mummified. My best guess is that at some point after arriving here, they realized that even with a facility like this they'd run out of food in due time." Foster kneels down to get closer to the corpse. "I'm having very vivid visions of it all, almost as if I'm there in the moment, but it's all happening so fast... They turned on each other in desperation. A small group decided to shut the rest off from the food supply, leaving them to starve. Then those in here lived off of what they had left until the life support systems gave out.`

			`	You leave the area and see that the large door that was blocking the way into the area is laying against a wall. Foster mentioned that the door had been welded shut, so the crew must have removed it somehow to investigate the area. You notice a large dent in the middle of the door.

			`	You find Eyama investigating the living quarters of the ship, which consists of long halls lined on either side by bunk rooms. Many of the doors are already opened, suggesting that Eyama has already been through many of them. She comes out of one of the bunk rooms after looking through it and notices you. "Captain <last>! What brings you here?" she asks.`
			`	"I'm wondering if you've found anything interesting yet," you respond.`
			`	"Oh, no. Nothing much," she says, sounding somewhat disappointed. "All I've found so far have been largely empty rooms. I would have thought that they would have kept personal items in their bunks, but it looks like they haven't. Or perhaps they were moved for some reason."`
			`	Eyama moves to the next door in the hallway. Instead of another bunk room though, the door opens to a larger room. Judging by the proximity to the bunk rooms, you'd assume this to have been a lounge area or cafeteria of sorts, but its contents suggest otherwise. The walls are covered with Sheragi writing and paintings, and the floor is scattered with various strange looking objects.`
			`	"Is this..." Eyama says, trailing off as she approaches one of the writings on the wall.`
			choice
				`	"What is it?"`
			
			`	Eyama runs her hand against the writing and begins speaking. The sounds match the guttural tongue with which she first greeted you. She pauses after each sound, as if reading single words or characters. "This is the Sheragi alphabet," she says with awe in her voice. Her attention then shifts to writing elsewhere. She reads it, then translates for you. "It says, 'Rekla have mercy on us.'" Next to the writing is a Sheragi handprint on the wall, one of many scattered throughout the large room. Eyama presses her hand to it, nearly covering it. "This is a young hand."`
			choice
				`	"Why is all this here?"`

The engines are powerful, so it perhaps took them 120 years to arrive here. Many of the Sheragi would have survived the trip, but would be very old when they arrived. This would have made it difficult for them to colonize the planet."`
			choice
				`	"So they would have needed to reproduce on the way here?"`

			`	"Yes. At least one, maybe two generations of Sheragi could have been born in that time."`

			`	Eyama stands up and looks toward the walls. "And these wall writings were used to teach them. These handprints are theirs. There are hundreds of them. And some of these words are their final prayers." Eyama seems to go into a trance as she walks around the room glancing at the many writings on the wall.`
			`	As Eyama wanders the room, you begin looking at the objects on the ground. One of them catches your eye; a book of massive proportions, slightly over twice the length and width of your average human book, although you imagine it would be perfectly-sized for a young Sheragi. You try to open the book but find that the covers are locked together, and the lock won't budge.`
			`	"Eyama, check this out," you say, snapping her out of her trance.`
			`	"Oh, a book?" she asks. She picks up the book and tries to open it herself. Without hesitating she reaches over to the lock and just pulls it right off before swinging open the massive cover.`

				`	"What does it say?"`

			`	She skims the pages. "This is a diary. It seems to be written by an adolescent Sheragi who was born on the ship. They talk about how they've never seen a planet or star up close before, but the adults on board tell them stories of a promised land that they are traveling to. It seems that they were close when this was written, perhaps only a few weeks away from the system."`
			`	She flips through the pages, getting further into the diary. "When they arrived at the system, they stayed in orbit around the planet. The author doesn't know everything that was going on, but there appeared to have been arguments over whether to land."`
			`	She then flips more pages. "Some of the Sheragi left to go to the planet, while others stayed behind. It doesn't sound like the split was amiable."`
			`	She continues to flip through the pages as they eventually turn blank. She then goes back and stops on the last written page. "Part of the remaining crew locked themselves in the hydroponic farm wing of the ship, leaving the rest of the crew with limited amounts of food. 'I'm scared and I don't know what to do.'" Eyama stops reading and closes the book, looking teary eyed. "That was the last line."`
			`	Eyama wipes a tear from her face. "A sad story, but there are plenty of sad stories in this place. No use in lingering on this one." Eyama puts the book under her arm and walks out into the hallway, going back to checking the living quarters.`

You eventually find Rakei with her crew walking through the halls of the underbelly of the ship. "Greetings, Captain," she says. "Is there something you need?"`
			`	"Have you found anything interesting down here?" you ask.`
			`	"Nothing out of the ordinary," she responds. "We just finished getting the power back online. We had to swap out some parts that look like they broke of old age. Seems like the power generation was active until the end.`
			`	"It turns out that the power generation and engines are all one unit, so I guess that's how they were able to make such powerful engines. We're heading to the life support systems now to make sure they're online so that you can safely disconnect your ship."`
			`	You follow her to the life support systems of the ship, a massive unit designed to scrub carbon dioxide out of the ship's atmosphere, keep the oxygen levels balanced, and warn about any potential leaks in the ship. Rakei finds the main control panel and begins tapping away at it. "Need to make sure this doesn't kill us when we turn it on." After a short while of working on the panel she simply flips a switch, turning it on.`
			`	"Huh," she says. "That was a bit too easy."`
			`	"What do you mean?" you ask.`
			`	"Well we needed to fix the power generation because of how it broke from use, but the life support systems are working just fine."`

The doorway leads to a sealed airlock. Rakei accesses a panel next to the airlock to see that the other side is pressurized and opens it.`
			`	On the other side of an airlock you find a large room with what looks like a runway going down the middle, leading to a shielded opening to the void of space. On either side of the room are three hangar bays. You spot that each of the hangars has a ship within it except for one.`
			`	"Fighters," Rakei says as she approaches one of them and begins examining it. "These look like interesting pieces of technology. I wonder how the Sheragi were able to even fit into one." She runs her hand along the hull of the fighter and sees some Sheragi writing on the side. "'Onyx Chariot.' That's its name."`

I'm not seeing any signs of a life support system, or even a way that a Sheragi could pilot this. There's barely even enough room for a younger Sheragi to fit in here. If the Sheragi couldn't have piloted these then why is there one missing?"`

"Is there anything I can help you with?"`
			`	"I'm just curious as to what you've found," you respond.`

Inside, among a mess of Sheragi components, lays a black box that looks exactly like the one that brought you here, and in pristine condition compared to it as well.`
			`	Desyo excitedly removes the black box from the compartment, detaching it from the ship's electronics and attaching it to a computer of her own.

She begins tapping away at the keys as she squints at the screen. "I can still make out some of what I was able to pull from the cube. It looks like... that cube had some information on a weapon. Some sort of... chemical weapon? It seems to include... mention of coordinates. But that's all I was able to get. Whatever coordinates they were are lost to time."`

The environmental suits brought along "just in case" turn out to be very useful here. The atmosphere would be unhealthy to breathe for long periods of time, and very uncomfortable in the short term, if you didn't bring them.`

It's very fortunate that the young life in this planet seems to still be unable to decompose those materials, leaving the ruins only at the mercy of weather and geological processes. They appear to have been melted into shape and built into walls over time, giving the buildings a rounded, anachronistic look, like mud huts made of modern materials. All around the inside there are remains of curtains and rags hanging from the ceiling to the ground. Closer inspection reveals the rags to have traces of exotic chemicals, likely made to react with the chlorine in the air to keep the atmosphere inside breathable.`
			`	The smaller rooms you come across appear to be just family homes, with a simplistic, single room interior, while the larger ones had other purposes, like what appears to have been a classroom, an animal carapace storage room holding the exoskeletons of many different species, a communal kitchen with remains of a solar oven, and most strikingly, a hatchery with relatively small beds, nests, and makeshift toys strewn about. Most of the rooms are littered with skeletons and remains, from the largest hunter-gatherers to the smallest young ones, a grim scene suggesting that some unknown catastrophe ended their lives all at once. Even then, the Sheragi on the surface apparently survived for much longer than the ones in the Emerald Sword, perhaps for many generations. Had the ship landed, they might have survived to this day.`
			`	Foster documents and takes pictures of everything that he sees. Although you'd expect him to be excited to see all this, like he was when investigating the Sheragi ruins on Zug, his mood is extremely somber.`
			`	While in one of the rooms, Eyama spots a young Sheragi skeleton laying on the ground that looks like they were reaching out for something when they died. Eyama kneels down next to the skeleton and reaches out to touch its hand. "Don't," Foster says from across the room, stopping Eyama from moving. "We need to leave this place undisturbed. We've done enough already by taking the ship." Eyama gets up without speaking, but gives a look of understanding to Foster.`
			`	After spending enough time among the ruins, you return to the ships with Foster and Eyama.`

			`	The final repairs on the Emerald Sword take up nearly an entire day, with the crew working in shifts to get the job done. Once the ship is patched up and all the systems are functional, the jump drive is installed. While the Emerald Sword was being worked on, Rakei was able to get a group to retrieve the final fighter and return it to the ship. All that is left to do now is to get the ship in orbit and return to <planet>.`

		log `Obtained an ancient Sheragi warship whose name translates to the Emerald Sword. It was crewed by mutineers that fled from their civil war and escaped into interstellar space. Found orbiting a disconnected star, it is an impressively large ship, fit for the equally large Sheragi. The ship's main weapon is a fusion-pumped gamma-ray laser called the 'Dragonflame Cannon.' Despite the relatively primitive outfits, it's still a very capable war machine due to its size.`
		conversation
			`Your exotic new ship draws a lot of attention from the dockworkers, partly because it is unique and never-before-seen, but probably even more so due to the unprecedentedly large cannon. Albert and the Hai archaeologists spend most of the day examining the ship in more detail and recovering the corpses, now that it's in a proper spaceport and they can access more complex equipment. Everything is completed in one particularly busy afternoon, and as night falls, the immense scale of the ship's interior allows more floors to be installed, giving you even more living space.`
			`	You go back to the same park as before with Albert and the three Hai in partial disguise, ice creams in hand and paws to commemorate the new acquisition.`
			`	"That is one impressive ship," you mention.`
			`	"True," Desyo says. "I've never seen a cannon that big before."`
			choice
				`	"I wonder how it works."`
					goto works
				`	"That's what she said."`
			`	Desyo doesn't understand, but Eyama bursts into laughter. "Classic human joke. You see, it implies--"`
			`	"God, don't explain it," Albert interrupts. "That was terrible. She's right though, that isn't something you see every day. Do you have any idea how it works?"`
			label works
			`	Rakei, who is more knowledgeable in this area, responds. "It's a fusion-pumped gamma-ray laser, or GRASER for short. The device is simple in concept, but the cost involved and the proportion of everything makes it impractical to develop, not to mention that to use it would probably be considered a war crime in many civilizations, thus making R&D not worth it. It's essentially using a nuclear flash to power a laser beam that penetrates and melts everything. Fascinating, but I'm hoping you'll use it only for peacekeeping purposes."`
			`	Eyama adds, "I've been calling it the Dragonflame Cannon. I think it's appropriate, even though it's technically not a flame in the chemical sense. The dragons of human legends could breathe fire, and although it's unlikely the Sheragi could actually do that, this cannon more than makes up for it."`
			choice
				`	"Do you think I could get in trouble by using it?"`
					goto trouble
				`	"It's not going to blow up my own ship, is it?"`
			`	Rakei laughs. "Don't worry, the Sheragi did their homework. They used simple materials, which means that the cannon can be maintained and repaired so that it continues to be structurally strong. Many of the components are active anyway, and they basically only exist for the short amount of time that the GRASER takes to fire. I only advise against firing it at point blank range."`
				goto catch
			label trouble
			`	"I don't think you will, as long as you don't fire it into a planet. It doesn't cause unnecessary suffering like nerve gas, and it isn't as indiscriminate as a nuclear bomb. This is a focused beam. It's going to poke holes straight through any ship subject to its wrath."`
			label catch
			`	"Then what's the catch?" you ask.`
			`	"It eats a lot of power. I mean a lot. And it does that every shot. No single reactor will be capable of making it shoot as fast as it possibly could. Expect to invest a lot in batteries and reactors if you want to re-outfit that warship and still use the cannon."`
			`	Desyo adds, "Also, don't go thinking you're invincible now. The shield matrix in that ship is incredibly primitive. Almost nonexistent. The hull is strong, but don't rely on it too much. Human technology could probably do better if they tried. No offense."`
			`	"So what are you going to do now?" you ask them.`
			`	Eyama responds. "We'll continue working with Albert. These two nerds like technology and ships, but I'm far more interested in the treasure trove of cultural artifacts the buried city holds. Not to mention the humans here are very interesting!"`
			`	You all finish your ice creams and continue chatting for a while longer before you say goodbye and return to your ship. By tomorrow, it will be in full working condition, ready to take to the endless void.`
