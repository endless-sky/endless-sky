The houses are built on a gargantuan scale, with most of the doorways at least ten meters tall. What's more, some of the buildings have no exterior doors on the street level, just doors facing balconies or inner courtyards, which supports the theory that the inhabitants were capable of flight. Most of the artifacts left behind are just everyday items, and in fact the technology seems less advanced than present human society, but scientists are studying the artifacts eagerly to glean hints about how these aliens lived.`
			`	The Quarg, who at other times seem quite willing to share their knowledge with human beings, are being surprisingly reticent with information about this lost civilization. Aside from telling Foster that the aliens were known as the Sheragi, their only comments have been vague warnings that if human beings persist in developing weapons of war, they will end up like the Sheragi. From this, Foster has surmised that the alien civilization was most likely destroyed by a civil war, not by natural disaster or an attack by another species.`
			`	It may not yield any great advances in human technology, but the dig will be providing clues to the history of the galaxy for years to come, and you can be proud to have played a part in that.`

One of the most intact relics is a small metal statue of an individual Sheragi in flight, possibly a trophy for some event, or perhaps a mere sculpture of a popular character of their time. It's impossible to know now, but one thing is certain: it's the most faithful representation available of what they looked like. The figure matches almost perfectly the ones you saw in your dream, back in Ildaria. As you turn your head to look at how tall the doors of this house are, then back at the statue again, you realize how big they must have been.

One of our interns suggested we survey deeper underground, to check for military facilities or bunkers, even though our previous scans didn't show anything interesting, so we allowed her to play around with the ground-penetrating radar. And wouldn't you believe it, there were some angled pieces of metal under the dirt. Clearly man-made. Well... Sheragi-made, in this case. So we dug deeper, and found what we can only assume to have been a bunker, showing signs of having been hit by a powerful kinetic weapon. Despite the damage, we could still salvage some artifacts from the debris. Particularly, this thing."`

			`Arriving on Mirrorlake, you ask around for a while, and eventually, someone directs you to the Museum of Galactic History: a huge, and very important place, but surprisingly not a very popular tourist spot. Most Hai aren't very fond of looking at the past, and most humans have no idea this place exists. The museum staff is surprised to see a human face, and as you wander you feel like you're drawing more attention from the locals than the exhibits themselves.`
			`	The place has a very unusual architecture vaguely resembling Earth's Ancient Greece, but clearly not based on any human design. Touches of metal, concrete, glass, and plastic add a modern aspect to its design. Exhibit rooms branch off a long corridor that makes up the majority of the building.  The rooms are arranged such that history proceeds backwards as you walk through the museum, with recent events at the front and the earliest at the back. One room you enter is dominated by a mural depicting the Hai's history of contact with humanity. It begins with the Alphas: most of the space is taken up by pictures of warships and artwork detailing battles between the Hai and Alphas. Around halfway through the mural, the green-skinned humans are replaced by ordinary ones. Here, there are surprisingly rich insights on human biology and culture.`
			`	As you continue to wander further down the aisle, you find rooms dedicated to the Korath raids, their civil war, and the first contact with them, along with a very poetic recounting of the origins of the Unfettered. Going deeper, you find even more sections: A long one detailing Hai culture on several different worlds and how they shifted with time, another on the fall of the trans-wormhole government and the decision to pull back into a small territory, one on the completion of the Quarg ringworld, one for Hai trade and military culture during their imperial phase, and a very grim-looking room on the Hai Civil Wars. Finally, after a very long walk, you arrive at a room nearly at the end of the aisle, recounting the history of the Sheragi.`
			choice
				`	(Continue into the Sheragi room.)`
			`	What you see here is much richer than what Albert Foster's little museum could ever hope to display. There are pictures of Sheragi military officials of the time, as well as their names and roles. Details on their culture, their biology, and their territorial fights with the Hai are provided as well. There is a huge statue of a bipedal dragon at the center of the room, around 8 meters tall, so large that the ceiling had to be raised. The inscription on the plaque at its feet indicates it is a reproduction of a life-sized Sheragi. A smaller interactive holographic display of one shows details on their biology and behavior. Samples of culture are scarce, but it indicates that they lived under a military meritocracy that valued strength and leadership above all else. Their fleets were fearsome, even with the pre-modern level of technology they had at the time of their demise. You see pictures and rough blueprints of their ships. They had angular, multi-layered armor that rivaled the strength of modern Hai vessels by sheer mass. If your measurement conversions are correct, their ships were bigger than anything else in human space, dwarfing even the Navy Carrier. A few of them display equally impressive spinal cannons of unknown capability, with grim descriptions suggesting that they were responsible for the extinction of the Sheragi... Weapons of mass destruction in the hands of a warlike and immature species that used them carelessly.`
			`	While you are looking around the room, one of the curators approaches you, speaking your own language albeit with a heavy accent.`

				goto next

			`	The curator laughs in the distinctive Hai way.`
			`	"That's one way to put it. I can't deny the scale of their engineering was a marvel even for the Hai of that time, and our civilization was already old. Some things scale well with size, and they had no choice but to build big. But it's still a shame. Imagine such capability being used for peace."`

			`	"Anyway, it's rare to see a human face here, and even more intriguing for them to be staring at Sheragi artifacts."`

			`	"Ohhh, right. They used to inhabit the part of human space that is now called the Rim. Are you looking for anything in particular?"`
			`	"I would like to know more about Sheragi computers," you respond.`
			`	"Hmmm, computers. The Sheragi built their hardware to last. Very sturdy electronics with redundancies, designed to be able to take a shot and survive. But still, I doubt they would have survived so many thousand years. If you want to identify how their hardware used to work, there are a few documents and manuals the ancient Hai stole from them."`
			`	"Are they for sale?" you inquire.`

You all sit down at a round table, you explain the situation, and they begin inquiring about the dig site on Zug, curious about the state of preservation of the ruins and what artifacts were found. They seem excited about it.`

			`It was a long trip, almost halfway across the galaxy. The Hai archaeologists have been quite friendly and amiable, giving you updates every time they made a new breakthrough. During this time, the cube, previously thought to be impenetrable, had been disassembled and cleaned. Components that decayed into a mess of oxidized wires and goopy paste over the eons have been identified and removed to substitute for equivalent ones, and a blueprint of the box and its circuits has started to take shape.`
			`	As soon as you land, you call Albert Foster, who doesn't believe you when you say you've gotten alien archaeologists to help. You then look for the three Hai to figure out how they're going to go unnoticed on a human world. You're surprised to find Eyama wearing long, dark but colorful human clothing with an equally oversized hoodie and a bandanna. You recognize this outfit, very popular with the youth these days, who are generally regarded as delinquents by the previous generation. Additionally, she's carrying two more sets, for her Hai partners as well. It hides her body really well at the cost of making her look like a young boy, and the Hai's relatively short stature doesn't help.`

You arrive at the museum and they immediately break character by being very obviously excited to see the exhibits. This probably comes as a relief to onlookers, however, who would normally expect that type of kid to vandalize priceless artifacts.`
			`	Finally, you arrive at Albert's workshop. He stops brushing layers of hardened soil off of what looks like it was once a television, and looks startled at you and the three "kids." The Hai take off their hoods and bandannas, causing his jaw to nearly drop to the floor.`

They talk about the box and their findings, while Albert talks about the history uncovered in the dig site and insights on the Sheragi daily life and culture. You close the door to make sure nobody else is listening in.`
			`	"We've managed to open the box and we're making a blueprint of it," says Desyo. "Once that's done, we might be able to rebuild the broken pieces and recover the data. We already have documentation on how their hardware worked."`

There's no telling what they thought at the time, but a military fleet was immediately dispatched to eliminate both fleets. One particular ship, the name of which Eyama has translated as 'Emerald Sword,' started behaving erratically when given orders. It fired and missed a few shots until it eventually stopped and fled. Clear signs of a mutiny. However, what is perhaps most interesting is that when it fled, it fled in an unexpected direction, away from any hyperlanes."`
			`	Albert continues, "We think they wanted to flee from the fighting. These were soldiers scarred by the horrors of the war, and they just got ordered to attack what we assume to be refugees. The Emerald Sword was a big ship, likely with an equally large crew, and from the movement data, it's engines were very powerful too, possibly capable of crossing interstellar distances within a Sheragi lifetime. This has some interesting implications. The ship was moving precisely towards a star named Zubenelhakrabi. Not significant enough to show up in the star maps, but we did our survey, and there is a potentially habitable planet there, but zero signs of intelligent life.

			`	As that is said, you're overcome by glimpses of memories that are not yours, not clear enough for you to identify what exactly is happening, but you can feel the sadness in them.`
			`	The voice continues: "I know what you seek here. The trinket you covet is of little relevance, even for your own, human standards. But if you wish to possess it, then take it. Show your respect to those who have perished here, learn their lessons, and I will allow it. Perhaps the sight of that vessel will remind the living races of those who have come and gone... and how, despite their great accomplishments, their decision to make war reduced them to graveyards, relics, memories... and dust."`
			`	The voice, and the overwhelming emotions that came alongside it, disappear as mysteriously as they came. Desyo, who witnessed you speaking into the void, asks whether you feel okay. It seems like no one else heard it.`

			`You dock with the Emerald Sword, and the crew starts working to carefully find a way in, directed by the Hai archaeologists. There is no atmosphere inside it as the life support has long since ceased to work, and it takes a long time to restore it through your ship's own life support and patch tiny micrometeorite holes. Once it's in inhabitable conditions, it still smells like a tomb. The crew starts going in, separated in teams by the archaeologists, to perform various tasks. Albert and Eyama go in first, taking notes and carefully collecting artifacts`
			`You find many Sheragi skeletons and mummified remains. A few of them have prosthetics that survived better than their host. Your crew gets to work cleaning up the thick layer of dust and grime that covers every surface, while the more specialized crew tries to bring the power core back to life and take advantage of the zero-G environment to move the jump drive into the ship more easily. You'll need to land to properly install it, however. All that is left for you to do is relocate the many corpses littering the living spaces with your crew.`

			`As you enter the atmosphere of the alien world, you begin running some scans of the air quality to determine if it is safe to breathe. You quickly learn why it is that the Sheragi perished in space; the atmosphere has a high concentration of chlorine gas, fatal to all living creatures aside from those that seem to have miraculously evolved here. It takes some time to find a suitable landing spot - high enough to escape the highest concentrations of chlorine gas in the atmosphere, but flat enough to land on. You eventually park your ships over a mesa. The environmental suits brought along "just in case" turn out to be very useful here. The atmosphere would be otherwise unbreathable for long periods of time.`
			`	Over the course of the next day, the workers unload some outfitting and repairing equipment, while scientists slowly work out the functions of the ship, and brief you and your crew on how to operate it. One of the workers invite you to visit the temporary outfitter and oversee the proper installation of the Outfits Expansion and the Jump Drive in the Emerald Sword.`

		log `Obtained an ancient Sheragi warship whose name translates to the Emerald Sword. It was crewed by mutineers that fled from their civil war and escaped into interstellar space. Found orbiting a disconnected star, it is an impressively large ship, fit for the equally large Sheragi. The ship's main weapon is a fusion-pumped gamma-ray laser called the 'Dragonflame Cannon.' Despite the relatively primitive outfits, it's still a very capable war machine due to its size.`

			`Your exotic new ship draws a lot of attention from the dockworkers, partly because it is unique and never-before-seen, but probably even more so due to the unprecedentedly large cannon. Albert and the Hai archaeologists spend most of the day examining your ship in more detail and recovering the corpses now that it's in a proper spaceport and they can access more complex equipment. Everything is completed in one particularly busy afternoon, and as night falls, the immense scale of the inside of the ship allows more floors to be installed, giving you even more living space.`
			`	You go back to the same park as before with Albert and the three Hai in partial disguise, ice creams in hand and paws to commemorate the new acquisition.`
			`	"That is one impressive ship," you mention.`
			`	"True," Desyo says. "I've never seen a cannon that big before."`
			choice
				`	"That's what she said."`
				`	"I wonder how it works."`
					goto works

			`	"God, don't explain it," Albert interrupts. "That was terrible. She's right though, that isn't something you see every day. Do you have any idea how it works?"`
			label works
			`	Rakei, who is more knowledgeable in this area, responds. "It's a fusion-pumped gamma-ray laser, or GRASER for short. The device is simple in concept, but the cost involved and the proportion of everything makes it impractical to develop, not to mention the way it works would probably be considered a war crime in many civilizations, thus making R&D not worth it. It's essentially using a nuclear flash to power a laser beam that penetrates and melts everything. Fascinating, but I'm hoping you'll only use it for peacekeeping purposes."`
			`	Eyama adds, "I've been calling it the Dragonflame cannon. I think it's appropriate, even though it's technically not a flame in the chemical sense. The dragons of human legends could breathe fire, and although it's unlikely the Sheragi could actually do that, this cannon more than makes up for it."`
			choice
				`	"Do you think I could get in trouble by using it?"`
					goto trouble
				`	"It's not going to blow up my own ship, is it?"`
			`	Rakei laughs. "Don't worry, the Sheragi did their homework. The simple materials they used means the cannon can be maintained and repaired, so it continues to be structurally strong. Many of the components are active anyway, and they basically only exist for the short amount of time that the GRASER takes to fire."`
				goto catch
			label trouble
			`	"I don't think you will, as long as you don't fire it into a planet. It doesn't cause unnecessary suffering like nerve gas, and it isn't as indiscriminate as a nuclear bomb. This is a focused beam. It's going to poke holes straight through any ship subject to its wrath."`
			label catch
			`	"Then what's the catch?" you ask.`
			`	"It eats a lot of power. I mean a lot. And it does that every shot. No single reactor will be capable of making it shoot as fast as it possibly could. Expect to invest a lot in batteries and reactors if you want to reoutfit that warship and still use the cannon.`
			`	Desyo adds. "Also, don't go thinking you're invincible now. The shield matrix in that ship is incredibly primitive. Almost nonexistent. The hull is strong, but don't rely on it too much. Human technology could probably do better if they tried."`
			`	"So what are you going to do now?" you ask them.`
			`	Eyama responds. "We'll continue working with Albert. These two nerds like technology and ships, but I'm far more interested in the treasure trove of cultural artifacts the buried city holds. Not to mention the humans here are very interesting!"`
			`	You all finish your ice creams and continue chatting for a while longer before you say goodbye and return to your ship. By tomorrow, it will be in full working condition, ready to take to the endless void.`

	description `From afar, this looks like a habitable planet, comfortably located on the near end of the goldilocks zone of its star. It has a high concentration of water vapor in its atmosphere and hosts primitive life, with mosses covering nearly all moist surfaces and exotic crustacean-like animals roaming the land, their carapaces made of what would be considered synthetic plastic elsewhere.`
	description `However, there is an unusually high concentration of toxic chlorine in the lower atmosphere. Without special equipment, one can only stay on the mountains to avoid the dense gas, and even then, only for a few hours before problems arise. Any trace of colonization by the Sheragi has long since eroded away.`
