# Outfits

outfit "Electromagnetic Battery"
	category "Power"
	cost 1000000
	thumbnail "outfit/embattery"
	"mass" 150
	"outfit space" -150
	"shield generation" 0.8
	"shield energy" 0.8
	"shield heat" 0.8
	"energy capacity" 20000
	description `This is a massive superconductive coil, capable of storing large amounts of energy in a magnetic field and discharging all of it in a fraction of a second. The magnetic field also provides a small boost to the shield regeneration of the ship, which is otherwise very underdeveloped.`

	"unplunderable" 1
	description `The Sheragi engines are much more than simple tubes spewing fire; they are a collection of interdependent devices, providing increased efficiency at the cost of modularity. These include a hyperdrive, an enormous fusion reactor, and the most powerful plasma engines you've ever seen. It's all examples of relatively simple technology, but they have been refined and taken to their extreme. The engines are fundamentally connected to the fusion reactor, increasing their thrust even further and thereby allowing the Emerald Sword to fly at impressive speeds, travelling through interstellar space with relative ease.`

outfit "Sheragi Cooling Unit"
	category "Systems"
	cost 1000000
	thumbnail "outfit/sheragicooling"
	"mass" 40
	"outfit space" -40
	"active cooling" 128
	"cooling" 24	
	"cooling energy" 16.2
	"fuel capacity" 200
	description `This Sheragi cooling system is primitive at best, but it works actively rather than passively, allowing it to dissipate much more heat than a simple radiator would. It does, however, drain a lot of power when subjected to the heat of battle. It also includes cryogenic tanks to hold some additional fuel, which is used as a temporary heat reservoir.`

outfit "Damaged Sheragi Systems"

	"unplunderable" 1
	description "There is a lot of broken Sheragi hardware in here. You need to fix these before you can take the ship back to Human space."

		"piercing" 0.3
		"heat damage" 40000
		"hit force" 2000
	description "The ancient Sheragi superweapon is simple in concept, but the cost involved in developing something like it is exorbitant. It's hard to envision what could have motivated the creation of such a thing. It uses an obscene amount of energy to create an extremely powerful fusion reaction, directing most of the energy from the resulting explosion forwards in a devastatingly powerful beam of gamma radiation."

outfit "Sheragi Anti-Missile"
	category "Turrets"
	cost 845000
	thumbnail "outfit/sheragiam"
	"mass" 35

		"velocity" 450
		"lifetime" 1
		"reload" 60
		"firing energy" 220
		"firing heat" 440
	description "This Sheragi anti-missile system fires an extremely powerful laser pulse capable of obliterating any missile in a single shot, but it comes at the expense of a long recharge time."

outfit "Particle Waveform Turret"
	category "Turrets"
	cost 1650000
	thumbnail "outfit/pwave turret"
	"mass" 47

		"firing heat" 651
		"shield damage" 110
		"hull damage" 270
		"heat damage" 1344
		"turret turn" 1.8
	description "This ancient Sheragi turret accelerates a dense packet of electrons that, while very ineffective against any kind of shielding, has a very long range and easily melts through matter. By the nature of these weapons, one can deduce that their tactics likely involved using the Dragonflame Cannon at long range to break the enemy shields and finishing them off at relatively close range with the Particle Waveform Turrets."
