			`	You take the chance to catch up as he leads you into the ancient city's ruins, talking about the "minor" discoveries he has made so far, though he insists on keeping the reason he brought you here a surprise. He leads you to one of the Sheragi buildings that have been uncovered, skipping a long queue lined before the entrance to find that a museum has been set up inside it with various artifacts on display.`
			`	It's strange to see so many technological devices as old as some of the prehistoric tools from ancient Earth, most of them so deteriorated you wouldn't even be able to imagine what they were used for if it wasn't for the descriptions next to their display cases. One of the most intact relics is a small metal statue of an individual Sheragi in flight, possibly a trophy for some event, or perhaps a mere sculpture of a popular character of their time. It's impossible to know now, but one thing is certain: it's the most faithful representation available of what they looked like. The figure matches almost perfectly the ones you saw in your dream, back in Ildaria. As you turn your head to look at how tall the doors of this house are, then back at the statue again, you realize how big they must have been. It's hard to imagine the size their spaceships must have been to even hope to fit a creature this large.`
			choice
				`	"This is an impressive collection."`

				goto offlimit

			`	"Straight to the point? Fair enough, I'm eager as well, but do come visit the museum some time in the future. There are so many interesting objects."`
			`	You take the chance to catch up as he leads you into the ancient city's ruins, talking about the "minor" discoveries he made so far, but he quickly gets to the reason you're here: an artifact found buried even further underground. He leads you into one of the buildings, in an area that is off-limits to the public.`
			label offlimit
			`	"Here it is!"`
			`	There is a tunnel going deep underground inside the room, but Albert sets his attention on a large safe instead. As he opens it up, he begins to explain the situation.`
			`	"So, from what we know, the Sheragi died off in a war of catastrophic proportions. One of our interns suggested we survey deeper underground, to check for military facilities or bunkers, even though our previous scans didn't show anything interesting, so we allowed her to play around with the ground-penetrating radar. And wouldn't you believe it, there were some angled pieces of metal under the dirt. Clearly man-made. Well... Sheragi-made, in this case. So we dug deeper, and found what we can only assume to have been a bunker, showing signs of having been hit by a powerful kinetic weapon. Despite the damage, we could still salvage some artifacts from the debris. Particularly, this thing."`
			`	Albert opens the safe and shows you a weathered, red metal cube, around half a meter on each side. He struggles with the weight, but manages to set it down on the floor.`
			`	"This appears to be a data storage device of some sort. It was connected to what we think were once computers, but nothing else was salvageable after spending thousands of years under the wet soil. Based on how sturdy this thing is, it's plausible that some of the data could have survived, like a time capsule.`
			`	"I have a contact back on Vinci who could probably figure this out, and this is where you come in. You remember John, right? I can't leave the dig site, but I also don't have anyone else I could trust to carry such a valuable artifact. Will you take it there for me?"`
			choice

			`	"Well, he's paying me to help with this, so no problem with me. It's not like everyone gets to see the exotic things he finds first hand. I mean, an artificial singularity..." he trails off, reminiscing about the adventure the three of you had in the Deep.`
			`	John proceeds to examine the cube. He's strong enough to pick it up with no problems and look at it from different angles, trying to find some port to connect to. He finds one, but it's so deteriorated that any attempts to use it would be fruitless. He places the cube inside a machine to take a deeper scan of the object, and watches it silently working, staring patiently at the screen.`
			`	"Yes, this seems to be a data storage device of some sort... it's made to be sturdy, like a black box, so it's plausible that we could recover some data from it. This is going to take a very long time, though."`
			`	"How long?" you ask.`
			`	"A couple months, probably. It depends on how alien this thing is, and if it's encrypted or not, but I should at least figure out if there is any recoverable data in here by then."`

Armed men in business suits surround your ship, and once you disembark, two of them guide you inside. You're led into a dimly lit room with a holographic map of the galaxy on the ceiling and a desk, behind which a hooded figure sits.`

Most Hai aren't very fond of looking at the past, and most humans have no idea this place exists. The museum staff is surprised to see a human face, and as you wander you feel like you're drawing more attention from the locals than the exhibits themselves.`
			`	The place has a very unusual architecture vaguely resembling Earth's Ancient Greece, but clearly not based on any human design. Touches of metal, concrete, glass, and plastic add a modern aspect to its design. Exhibit rooms branch off a long corridor that makes up the majority of the building.  The rooms are arranged such that history proceeds backwards as you walk through the museum, with recent events at the front and the earliest at the back. One room you enter is dominated by a mural depicting the Hai's history of contact with humanity. It begins with the Alphas: most of the space is taken up by pictures of warships and artwork detailing battles between the Hai and Alphas. Around halfway through the mural, the green-skinned humans are replaced by ordinary ones. Here, there are surprisingly rich insights on human biology and culture.`

Going deeper, you find even more sections: A long one detailing Hai culture on several different worlds and how they shifted with time, another on the fall of the trans-wormhole government and the decision to pull back into a small territory, one on the completion of the Quarg ringworld, one for Hai trade and military culture during their imperial phase, and a very grim-looking room on the Hai Civil Wars. Finally, after a very long walk, you arrive at a room nearly at the end of the aisle, recounting the history of the Sheragi.`
			choice
				`	(Continue into the Sheragi room.)`
			`	What you see here is much richer than what Albert Foster's little museum could ever hope to display. There are pictures of Sheragi military officials of the time, as well as their names and roles. Details on their culture, their biology, and their territorial fights with the Hai are provided as well. There is a huge statue of a bipedal dragon at the center of the room, around 8 meters tall, so large that the ceiling had to be raised. The inscription on the plaque at its feet indicates it is a reproduction of a life-sized Sheragi. A smaller interactive holographic display of one shows details on their biology and behavior. Samples of culture are scarce, but it indicates that they lived under a military meritocracy that valued strength and leadership above all else. Their fleets were fearsome, even with the pre-modern level of technology they had at the time of their demise. You see pictures and rough blueprints of their ships. They had angular, multi-layered armor that rivaled the strength of modern Hai vessels by sheer mass. If your measurement conversions are correct, their ships were bigger than anything else in human space, dwarfing even the Navy Carrier. A few of them display equally impressive spinal cannons of unknown capability, with grim descriptions suggesting that they were responsible for the extinction of the Sheragi... Weapons of mass destruction in the hands of a warlike and immature species that used them carelessly.`
			`	While you are looking around the room, one of the curators approaches you, speaking your own language albeit with a heavy accent.`

				goto next

			`	The curator laughs in the distinctive Hai way.`
			`	"That's one way to put it. I can't deny the scale of their engineering was a marvel even for the Hai of that time, and our civilization was already old. Some things scale well with size, and they had no choice but to build big. But it's still a shame. Imagine such capability being used for peace."`

			`	"Anyway, it's rare to see a human face here, and even more intriguing for them to be staring at Sheragi artifacts."`
			`	You explain about the ruins recently discovered on Zug.`
			`	"Ohhh, right. They used to inhabit the part of human space that is now called the Rim. Are you looking for anything in particular?"`
			`	"I would like to know more about Sheragi computers," you respond.`
			`	"Hmmm, computers. The Sheragi built their hardware to last. Very sturdy electronics with redundancies, designed to be able to take a shot and survive. But still, I doubt they would have survived so many thousand years. If you want to identify how their hardware used to work, there are a few documents and manuals the ancient Hai stole from them."`
			`	"Are they for sale?" you inquire.`
			`	"You want to buy a copy of the documents? Right now? I'm intrigued. Did you actually find something that still works?"`

You all sit down at a round table, you explain the situation, and they begin inquiring about the dig site on Zug, curious about the state of preservation of the ruins and what artifacts were found. They seem excited about it.`

Components that decayed into a mess of oxidized wires and goopy paste over the eons have been identified and removed to substitute for equivalent ones, and a blueprint of the box and its circuits has started to take shape.`

You then look for the three Hai to figure out how they're going to go unnoticed on a human world.

They talk about the box and their findings, while Albert talks about the history uncovered in the dig site and insights on the Sheragi daily life and culture. You close the door to make sure nobody else is listening in.`
			`	"We've managed to open the box and we're making a blueprint of it," says Desyo. "Once that's done, we might be able to rebuild the broken pieces and recover the data. We already have documentation on how their hardware worked."`

There's no telling what they thought at the time, but a military fleet was immediately dispatched to eliminate both fleets. One particular ship, the name of which Eyama has translated as 'Emerald Sword,' started behaving erratically when given orders. It fired and missed a few shots until it eventually stopped and fled. Clear signs of a mutiny. However, what is perhaps most interesting is that when it fled, it fled in an unexpected direction, away from any hyperlanes."`
			`	Albert continues, "We think they wanted to flee from the fighting. These were soldiers scarred by the horrors of the war, and they just got ordered to attack what we assume to be refugees. The Emerald Sword was a big ship, likely with an equally large crew, and from the movement data, it's engines were very powerful too, possibly capable of crossing interstellar distances within a Sheragi lifetime. This has some interesting implications. The ship was moving precisely towards a star named Zubenelhakrabi. Not significant enough to show up in the star maps, but we did our survey, and there is a potentially habitable planet there, but zero signs of intelligent life.

			`	"I don't think you will, as long as you don't fire it into a planet. It doesn't cause unnecessary suffering like nerve gas, and it isn't as indiscriminate as a nuclear bomb. This is a focused beam. It's going to poke holes straight through any ship subject to its wrath."`
			label catch
			`	"Then what's the catch?" you ask.`
			`	"It eats a lot of power. I mean a lot. And it does that every shot. No single reactor will be capable of making it shoot as fast as it possibly could. Expect to invest a lot in batteries and reactors if you want to reoutfit that warship and still use the cannon.`
			`	Desyo adds. "Also, don't go thinking you're invincible now. The shield matrix in that ship is incredibly primitive. Almost nonexistent. The hull is strong, but don't rely on it too much. Human technology could probably do better if they tried."`
			`	"So what are you going to do now?" you ask them.`
			`	Eyama responds. "We'll continue working with Albert. These two nerds like technology and ships, but I'm far more interested in the treasure trove of cultural artifacts the buried city holds. Not to mention the humans here are very interesting!"`
			`	You all finish your ice creams and continue chatting for a while longer before you say goodbye and return to your ship. By tomorrow, it will be in full working condition, ready to take to the endless void.`

planet "Echoes of Tragedy"
	attributes uninhabited
	landscape land/fog4
	description `From afar, this looks like a habitable planet, comfortably located on the near end of the goldilocks zone of its star. It has a high concentration of water vapor in its atmosphere and hosts primitive life, with mosses covering nearly all moist surfaces and exotic crustacean-like animals roaming the land, their carapaces made of what would be considered synthetic plastic elsewhere.`
	description `However, there is an unusually high concentration of toxic chlorine in the lower atmosphere. Without special equipment, one can only stay on the mountains to avoid the dense gas, and even then, only for a few hours before problems arise. Any trace of colonization by the Sheragi has long since eroded away.`
	outfitter "empty"
