			`	You ask, "How much can you pay?"`
			`	They are silent for a long moment, looking down at the table. Finally, the boy says, "We're crew on a pirate ship, hardly better than slaves. The captain keeps our wages. We don't get paid anything unless they agree to let us go. Which isn't going to happen. But if you help us start a new life, we'll work hard and some day we'll pay you back.

			`	As you are conversing, someone else walks into the bar: a bearded man, and a rough-looking teenage boy. They stand in the doorway, scanning the room. "That's our captain," she says. "Please, you have to help us. There's a service tunnel that connects to the back entrance of the bar. We can escape through there."`
			`	You've heard of these service passageways: the most dangerous part of this lawless station, dimly lit and seldom travelled, except by drug addicts and prostitutes. This whole thing might just be a ruse to lure you into one, where they can attack you without anyone interfering. "No," says the boy, "if we head for the service tunnel, they'll be sure to notice us. Let's just stay at the table until they go away."`

			`	"Let's try the tunnel," you say.`
			`	The boy stands up. "Wait ten seconds, then head to the tunnel," he says. He walks into the bathroom, which is right next to back entrance that she pointed out. You wait for a few seconds, then stand up and head for the service tunnel. "Don't run," says the girl. "Walk slowly. Pretend. You've had a bit too much to drink. We're headed out back to find some privacy." You don't dare look behind you to see if the men in the doorway are watching you.`
			`	Finally, you reach the back entrance. It's an old-fashioned airtight door, in case the service tunnel depressurizes. She spins the wheel to unlock it, and then gives it a yank. The hinges squeal, but it opens enough for you to squeeze through. You find yourselves in a narrow corridor lit only by flickering sodium lamps. In the yellow lamplight her face and hands look pale, jaundiced. The floor of the corridor is littered with beer bottles and discarded hypodermic needles. To one side of the door are several over-stuffed trash cans. As you step into the corridor, a rat scurries away into the darkness.`
			`	A few second later, watching through the open airlock, you see the boy walk out of the bathroom. He can't help stealing a quick glance towards the men in the doorway, after which he quickly ducks through the airlock and slams the door shut. "Run!" he whispers.`
			`	You begin running down the corridor, in the direction of your ship. You pass a man, slumped over in a corner; there is no time to see if he is dead, or just sleeping. In places the lights have gone out, and it is so dim that you can barely see the floor beneath you. Your footsteps pounding on the metal decking ring terribly loud up and down the empty hallway. You cannot tell if the sound of more footsteps behind you is just an echo, or someone following you.`
			`	Eventually the passageway widens out into some sort of maintenance room, with large tanks and humming equipment lining the walls. There are also several small, windowless sheds. You duck behind one of them and listen for sounds of pursuit. You hear nothing. "I think we're safe," says the boy. He walks over to another airlock door on the opposite wall and tugs it open. Light pours in, almost blinding at first. You are looking out into the rimway, the main passage in this ring of the station. Crowds of people are walking past, paying no attention to you. He glances quickly in both directions, then gestures for you to follow.`
				goto ship
			
			label outside
			`	You wait at the table, playing with the computer terminal at the center of it, pretending that you are busy placing a drink order. The men at the door do not leave. Instead, they step into the room and begin circling around the edge of it. Fortunately, right now they are headed away from you. "What berth is your ship in?" asks the boy. You tell him. "Wait ten seconds, then follow," he says. He stands up and walks through the door. The searchers glance at him as he leaves, but they must be looking for two people together, because they ignore him.`
			`	The searchers approach the bar and begin talking to one of the bartenders. You and the girl stand up. "Walk slowly," she hisses under her breath. "Saunter. Don't run." You put an arm around her shoulders and do your best to act like an ordinary bar patron headed home with a new friend after having a bit too much to drink. You don't dare to glance at the bar to see if you are being watched.`
			`	Finally you reach the door. You are in the rimway, the main passage in this ring of the station. It is crowded and brightly lit. You quicken your pace slightly and begin walking toward your ship, still afraid that if you break into a run, you will attract attention. The girl keeps glancing at the shop windows that you pass by: checking the reflection for anyone following you. "They're leaving the bar," she says. And then, "They're walking in the other direction. I think we're safe."`
			`	You pass a narrow doorway, probably an entrance to one of the service tunnels. The boy is standing there, holding a gun by his side. His grim expression softens somewhat when he sees you approaching. He looks out behind you, scanning the crowd, then steps out of the doorway to follow you.`
				goto ship
			
			label ship
			`	You quickly make your way back to your ship. As soon as the door has closed behind you, all three of you breathe a sigh of relief. A second later, the baby begins to wail, loudly. As you show them to their bunks, they introduce themselves as Joe and Maria; the baby's name is Jesse. "I don't know how to thank you," says Maria.`
			`	"Please don't take too long leaving the station," adds Joe. "But, I think we'll be safe here until you're ready to leave. There's no way they can search all the ships on the dock."`

			`	The basic concept of the poster seems to be that instead of altering the climate of a planet through brute force, it ought to instead be feasible to use a properly timed nudge in the right direction to cause the climate to shift toward a new equilibrium point that supports greater biological complexity. This student seems to think that planets naturally "want" to grow more complex and support more life, but that they sometimes get "stuck" in less optimum states.`
			`	It's an intriguing idea. On the other hand, at the bottom of the paper, the professor has written, "Very poor scholarship. Do not anthropomorphize planets."`
			`	Just then, Eric and Alaric return, looking disappointed.`
			choice
				`	"No luck?"`
			`	They shake their heads. "It would cost fifteen million just to bring a specialist out for an initial consultation," says Eric, "and besides, the cost of terraforming machinery and upkeep is prohibitive. I think this whole Academy is just a money-making racket."`
			choice
				`	"Have a look at this poster. Maybe this student would help us. We could bill it as a sort of internship for her."`
				`	"Indeed. They gave this student a failing grade just for suggesting it could be done more cheaply."`
			
			`	They look at the poster. "Sounds almost too good to be true," says Alaric. "Hang on, I'll look her up in the campus directory." A few minutes later, he is on the phone with the student who made the poster. Her name is Amy. It turns out she is about to flunk out anyway, and is more than willing to travel back to Rand with you when offered a tiny fraction of what the consultant would have received.`
			`	An hour later, you meet up with Amy, and arrange for her to join you on your ship before it takes off. Eric and Alaric are very excited, but you are a bit worried about the wisdom of entrusting their planet's future to someone so young and inexperienced.`

			`Alaric, Eric, and Amy are having a heated conversation at a table in the bar. When they see you, Alaric says, "Okay, let's let Captain <last> be the tie breaker." He motions to you to join them.`
			`	Amy explains, "Based on my data, it appears that Rand once had a cooler, more moist climate. But the trouble is, it has almost no axial tilt."`
			`	"That means no changing seasons," explains Eric.`
			`	"The result is that much of the planet is very hot, but the poles are very cold. Nearly all the planet's water has migrated to the poles and ended up frozen into the ice caps. Because the weather is so unchanging here, nothing ever prompts that water to melt and rejoin the hydrological cycle."`
			choice
				`	"Well, that seems impossible to fix. It's not like you can rotate a planet's axis."`

				`	"Are you suggesting melting the ice caps somehow?"`
					goto melting
			label rotate
			`	"Of course not," she says. But what we can do is introduce a sudden variation in the planet's climate that will allow water to be distributed more evenly across the surface again."`
				goto danger
			label melting
			`	"That would be the traditional terraforming approach," she says, "using orbital mirrors, or geothermal power, or something similar to evaporate the ice caps at a faster rate than new ice is being deposited. That approach would take a century or so."`
				goto danger
			label danger
			`	"This is where Amy's plan gets a bit scary," says Alaric.`
			`	"I'm proposing crashing a medium-sized asteroid into the ice cap," she says. "If we pick the right asteroid, we can control the amount of dust that is created. The result will be a sudden influx of variability, that may allow the planet to revert to a wetter, more biodiverse state."`
			choice
				`	"That is a stupid idea, and I want nothing to do with it."`
					decline
				`	"Well, if you think it will work, I'm willing to try it!"`
			`	"Great!" says Amy. "I'll mark the asteroid on your radar. You just need to board it, install a small ion thruster, and wait for it to land on the planet, then return here."`

			`	"What's next?" you ask.`

			`When you get back to <planet>, Amy has you fly in a random path a few kilometers above the surface while she periodically dumps loads of seeds and plant material out the airlock. In the process, you fly through several rainstorms. This world's climate has indeed been altered. But you can't help wonder how a few tons of seed spread out over the entire surface of a planet is really going to help anything.`
