	description "Copper is a common metal found in almost every asteroid in small amounts. Even so, it still goes for a fair price given its high demand for use in electrical wiring."

outfit "Iron"
	category "Special"
	thumbnail "outfit/iron"
	cost 464
	"mass" 1
	description "Iron is not as common as copper in asteroids, but is just as highly demanded. Iron is used in the creation of steel, an important material for building planetary infrastructure and many of the parts and outfits for ships."

	"mass" 1
	description "Due to silver's spectacular properties, it is used for a wide number of things, such as more expensive electrical wiring in larger ships, as a key material in photovoltaic panels, and perhaps most importantly, as a cheap way of purifying water while in the depths of space."

	"mass" 1
	description "Although gold has lost some value over the years due to planetary and asteroid mining making it much more common than in the early days of humanity's expansion, it is still a highly sought after mineral due to its beauty and demand in jewelry."

	description "During the early 22nd century, asteroid mining was a common practice among humanity. Resources were plentiful and the labor was cheap. But during the vast expansion of humanity, asteroid mining was left behind for better mining operation on newly found planets."

Thus the mining laser was created, a low power laser intended for the use of bursting away the outer layers of asteroids to reveal the precious minerals beneath the crust without destroying the asteroid itself."

As a result, miners began strapping their lasers to old blaster turret platforms to get more control out of their lasers."

	description "As the Syndicate started to mine away the asteroid fields in some systems, they began running into bigger and tougher asteroids. It began taking hours for a single mining laser to reveal enough minerals on an asteroid to make profit. In response, the Syndicate developed the advanced mining laser, which outputs more energy than the normal mining laser and is able to reveal ten times the material in the same amount of time."
