There's been an uptick in pirate attacks in the Algieba system. The brass knows they're poaching something on the surface of Watcher; some kind of flower, I think. Psychoactive, opiate-like effects. The pirates are taking it somewhere, refining it, smuggling it out to half a dozen systems, and making a fortune. The cargo is several tons of surveillance drones; microscopic taggers. The idea is to disperse them so that when the pirates next load up on these flowers or whatever, they'll also get a bunch of drones that we can use to track to their refinery. You and Frank are supposed to act as cover, keep the pirates from guessing what we're up to." He shakes his head in exasperation. "It's always this James Bond garbage with NavInt.
