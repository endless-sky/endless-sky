	description "Though designed for planetary population control, the peacekeeping staff also works exceptionally well for ship defense. The staff emits a short-ranged beam that incapacitates anyone it touches by causing them to enter a euphoric and hallucinogenic state, wandering off to somewhere where they won't cause any trouble. Coming down from the state of euphoria is never pleasant."
