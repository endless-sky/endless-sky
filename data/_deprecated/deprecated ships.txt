	description "After the Korath were exiled from their homelands, efficient resource collection became a priority. World-ships were too precious to risk on dangerous forays, and Raiders lacked the cargo capacity. The Dredger was born as an answer to this problem, featuring an abundance of cargo and passenger space, with formidable defensive armament. With such a complement, these bulky ships can also offer potent support for frontline Raiders."

	description "Successive Raider designs have been the Korath warship of choice for plundering neighboring species for generations."

The spaceborne construction techniques employed allow for the ship's easy replacement, facilitating continued raids of nearby systems."
