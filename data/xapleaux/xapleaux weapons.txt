	description "The Terpenoid Trajectile was developed after brief exposure to the Korath Disruptor before the Korath stopped bothering to raid Xapleaux space. The secrets of how the disruptor worked were never understood, but under the right circumstances fuel mixed with certain volatiles can be stimulated to produce a similar effect. Once assembled and fired the concoction will naturally decay explosively after a period of time."
	description "	Although not a powerful missile, it is very fast and very hard to dodge, and capable of rendering the shields of an enemy vessel thoroughly obsolete under repeated bombardment. The explosive cocktail it carries is not particularly damaging to shields, despite its disruptive effect, but is quite destructive against most hull materials."

	description "Functionally the oldest weapon in the Xapleaux arsenal, this three stage weapon launches a Quininoid package - a missile casing with five warheads inside. In its first phase it is slow but incredibly mobile, able to safely position and orient on its target. In its second phase it engages the primary burner and loses most ability to home in on a target as it accelerates with enormous speed before bursting apart in its third phase where it releases five warheads in a purely ballistic scattering effect."
	description "	An individual warhead for this weapon is very low yield, but the rate of fire is the key feature. A ship carrying several of these can flood the space between it and the target with an impenetrable wall of projectiles that are particularly effective at keeping swarms of small craft (or wildlife) at bay."

As it does no damage it is not a military weapon at all, but does avoid angering swarms or otherwise breaking apart hazardous objects. As such it is frequently deployed by both military and civilians alike for general security purposes."
