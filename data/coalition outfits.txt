	description "One of these solar panels is enough to meet the energy needs of a medium-sized Coalition civilian ship, especially given the energy efficiency of their engines and the fact that under their laws only Heliarch ships are allowed to have weapons."

	description "Solar power is sufficient for commerce, but excessive thriftiness is seldom a winning strategy in warfare. So for ships that must have a reliable energy source to power weapons, the Heliarchs use nuclear reactors."

	description "This reactor was designed for the most powerful Heliarch warships. Its design has not changed significantly in the millennia since the first battle with the Quarg, but each generation of reactors is made slightly more efficient than the previous ones."
