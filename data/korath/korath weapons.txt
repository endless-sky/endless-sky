	description "This weapon fires homing balls of microbots that pass through a target's shields and attempt to convert its hull into raw materials or useful items such as heat shunts. As Exile microbots contain safety circuits that prevent them from becoming independent of their Systems Core, they will fail after a short time, but not before wreaking havoc on the ship."
	description "	Because the same property that allows the microbots through a target's shields disrupts the shields of the ship firing them, it should never be used without an appropriately large Systems Core. Given adequate shield generation, however, the microbots make fantastic miners."

	description `Langrage Hyper-Heavers raise the use of improvised ammunition to a fine art. This turret converts scrap metal, nearby asteroids, compressed garbage, or other debris into a high speed debris field. The exact mechanism is unclear, but the internal workings bear some similarities to hyperdrives and Banishers.`
	description `	At close range, the heaved langrage merely forces the enemy back. As the launch field collapses and the langrage returns fully to normal space, however, it is rent into a rapidly-expanding cloud of deadly projectiles as it returns to normal space.`
