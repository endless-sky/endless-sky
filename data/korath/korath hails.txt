# This is a derived work from Lia Gerty's documents.
#
# The words in this file were "translated" to korath languages using
# the methodology described at the top of this PR:
#
#    https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/pull/7101
#
# Guidance on food, culture, etc. comes from the Korath lore document.

# Phrases begin with one of these:
#
# "efreti:"         = Kor Efret language phrase
# "exile:"          = Korath Exile language phrase
# "exile humanika:" = severely mispronounced human phrases spoken by Korath Exiles
# "exile mixed:"    = contains a mix of Exile and mispronounced human words.
#
# The Exiles can speak a smattering of human words learned from raids,
# though they lack any knowledge of grammar since theirs is vastly
# different than ours. They can demand cargo or ask you not to gas
# them, but they can't communicate complex concepts; the language
# barrier is still quite high. Don't expect treaty negotiations or
# research collaborations anytime soon, unless you find a translator.
