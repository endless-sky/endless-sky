The Quarg were surprised to learn that the flames shooting out the back of the ship were in fact its intended mode of propulsion."

	description "	These are the largest gravitoplasma thrusters that the Efreti have to offer, and as such are usually only found on their gargantuan civilian ships. Despite their size and thrusting power, the Quarg are still rather unimpressed with the inefficient nature of the design."

The smallest steering manages to develop a great deal of torque at the expense of higher energy costs."

Their high energy usage is tempered by the fact that they are usually powered by the most massive Korath fusion reactors."

The resulting gel then drains into the vat below while the robots are recalled.`
	description `	Many races find this means of defense abhorrent. Citing the excruciating, confusing death experienced by its victims, the violation of taboos relating to cannibalism, and erroneous fears that the microbots could somehow "escape," possession of these airlocks may result in heavy fines.`
