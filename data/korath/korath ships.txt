	description "After the Korath were exiled from their homelands, efficient resource collection became a priority. World-ships were too precious to risk on dangerous forays, and raiders lacked the cargo capacity. The Rano'erek-class Asteroid Dredging Ship, named for a respected civilian politician and economist, was born as an answer to this problem."
	description "	Featuring an abundance of cargo and passenger space in addition to their formidable defensive armament, these bulky ships can also offer potent support for frontline Palavrets."

	description "Successive raider designs have been the Korath warship of choice for plundering neighboring species for generations. Named for a celebrated captain who gave her life to ensure her crippled vessel made it back to port with its desperately needed cargo of stolen fish, the Palavret-Class Raiding Ship continues that grim tradition."
	description "	Like all Exile ships, the Palavret has been adapted to house as many Korath as possible, as comfortably as possible, inflating its size beyond similarly armed warships. The spaceborne construction techniques employed allow for the ship's easy replacement, facilitating continued raids of nearby systems."

	description "The venerable Palavret has been a mainstay of the Korath raiding fleet, elements of its design dating back from before the era of shortages and desperation caused by a life in exile. Over forty generations of raiders have terrorised neighboring systems over the centuries."
	description `Constant warfare against surrounding aliens has been building pressure on Korath shipyards to recover some of their ancient prowess. Now, with a fresh industrial network to draw upon, the Korath have created a new raider to deal with modern targets, and the Tubfalet-Class Raiding Ship is named for an admiral who dealt with such enemies. Despite extensive injuries, he remained on his flag bridge during a Remnant attack, leading his squadron to victory.`

	description "While perhaps, at first, seeming like a super-sized 'olofez-Class Carried Chaser, the 'nra'ret-Class Chaser is not only the first truly unique warship design the Exiles have fielded since the Exodus, but also the first built solely for combat instead of needing to double as a habitat or supply ship. Its size and non-modular nature also means it must be constructed wholesale at the largest Korath facilities, something that, until recently, was generally reserved for the likes of the massive Ik'atilajej and the Korsmanath A'awoj."
	description "	The 'nra'ret-Class Chaser, named in honor of a brilliant weapons engineer who took their own life to avoid having their secrets captured by a hostile alien force, provides the Exiles with a fast and powerful patrol striker both in support of large raiding fleets and as independent units. To this end, it is armed with numerous missile ports designed to rain fire on enemies from afar. It also carries a pair of langrage heavers for sustained operations, and two Fire-Lances for emergency use in close quarters."
