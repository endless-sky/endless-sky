	description "After the Korath were exiled from their homelands, efficient resource collection became a priority. World-ships were too precious to risk on dangerous forays, and Raiders lacked the cargo capacity. The Dredger was born as an answer to this problem, featuring an abundance of cargo and passenger space, with formidable defensive armament. With such a complement, these bulky ships can also offer potent support for frontline Raiders."

	description "The largest of Korath production vessels are derived from a common and ancient chassis. This many-lobed ship has been adapted to carry fighters into large-scale raids, or mining craft into asteroid belts. Its radial arrangements of hangars allows fighters a maximum variety of safe approach patterns in combat."

	description "When the Korath were exiled, it was on these gargantuan 'world-ships' they first fled and lived on. Since the introduction of purpose-built city ships, these ancient vessels have mostly been decommissioned, turned into stations, or reconfigured into smaller, specialized vessels. Yet a few still ply the starlanes, crewed by those too restless to live on stations yet not bold enough to go on raids."
