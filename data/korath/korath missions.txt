				`	(Turn around and try to run back to the spaceport.)`
			`	You hear the shuffling of feet behind you and turn around. Three towering Korath wearing similar heavy clothing have stepped out of a nearby doorway and are making their way toward you. The bleating noise returns, and you turn again, only to see the original Kor Efret has returned from around the corner. Whatever chance you had of getting out of this is gone now.`
			`	The one in front turns back to where it came from, and the Korath behind you hisses and gestures forward. It looks like you should follow. You brace yourself and turn the corner to see... animals?`
			`	The rusting buildings have given way to a massive abandoned plaza, and the entire space is taken up by a mix of large livestock and supplies. They remind you of sheep, but they're around five times larger, have six legs, and come in a variety of brown-black colors. Each has a full coat of fur and an additional blanket made of their own wool-like fabric on them. It's the same material these Korath are wearing. Even with their extra blanket, the "sheep" are huddled in small groups and look uncomfortably cold. They occasionally bleat loudly whenever a cold wind rushes through the plaza. Fortunately for you, these Kor Efreti look to be farmers, not muggers. This must have been the only place near the spaceport where they could keep their entire herd together.`
			`	The one who led you here, who also seems to be the leader, gestures for you to come over to it. It has opened a paper map - a rare sight in the era of interstellar travel. When you take a look, you realize it's not of the local area, but space; it seems to show the surroundings systems. The Korath points to one, pauses and gestures broadly at the mix of livestock and supplies, then draws its finger to another system and says something that sounds roughly like <planet>. "<planet>?" you confirm, and the Korath hisses in approval. It looks like they want transportation there. You wager the livestock and supplies will take up roughly <tons>, and there are <bunks> Korath farmers in the group.`
			`	It pulls a stack of 200 credits from its pocket and sets it on the ground before drawing a circle around it with a piece of chalk. It then draws four more, makes a large circle around the five total smaller ones, then draws nine additional large circles. Your best guess is it's offering 10,000 credits for their transport.`

				`	(Agree to take them.)`
				`	(Decline the job.)`

			`	You indicate your agreement by pointing to <planet> on the map and gesturing to yourself. Once it understands you've agreed, the Korath holds its palms toward you and moves them in a circular motion. You lead one to your ship while the rest stay behind to prepare the animals. When you arrive, it immediately goes to work spreading tarps over the floor and scattering a type of straw over them. After some time, you notice one of the "sheep" emerge from an alleyway led by a farmer that had stayed behind. Behind it is another animal, then another. The line of livestock, interspersed with the farmers keeping things moving, slowly makes it way into your hangar over the next hour.`
			`	As they enter your climate-controlled ship, the farmers take the hefty, wool-like blankets off the "sheep" and remove most of their own layers. One takes the entire pile of fabric to a nearby vendor and exchanges it for credits while the others go back and grab the supplies still in the plaza. By nightfall, everything and everyone is finally loaded onto your ship. The Korath who had sold the clothes to the merchant gives you the entire stack of 4,100 credits. Hopefully you'll get the rest after you get to <planet>.`

			`The animals are surprisingly comfortable on the ship, but the Korath struggle. Based on how often they're in and out of the bathroom during the one-jump trip, none of them have been in hyperspace before. When they get over their space sickness, they busy themselves shaving the wool-like fur off the animals and gathering it.`
			`	As you land and open the cargo doors to reveal the hot world of <planet>, the animals shift excitedly. They seem much more energetic than any time before now, so much so that the Korath have some trouble keeping them all together as they exit the ship. The slow desertification of this planet is surely a cause for concern, but it seems to provide a much healthier environment for these animals than Setar Fort's chilling temperatures do. Once everything is off your ship, a Korath takes the wool to another vendor and again sells it, then it returns and hands you 5,900 credits. With the 4,100 credits it gave you before leaving, you've received all 10,000 promised credits. It holds its hands up with its palms toward you then leaves to join the other farmers.`

They used to be obsessed with art, music, and other esoterics. I care more for practical matters, but I must admit that I enjoy our old recordings of their music. Haunting guttural hums accented by angelic vocals with lyrics in their intricate language. The mood goes from eerie and hopeful to enlivening to frightening from verse to verse and draws the listener with them. Accompanied by mesmerizing visuals, the experience absorbs you in alluring totality."`
			`	He looks slightly embarrassed and switches to the practical matters. "The Hai and Korath were on good terms - trading goods and culture - until the lizards got desperate for resources and invaded us. Their technology is far beyond ours, but we defended valiantly. I'm not sure we would have won on our own, but they nearly wiped themselves out in bloody infighting. Ultimately, it was stronger and older races that ended a self-destructive spiral towards extinction. As an Unfettered, I have grievances with the Drak, but I am glad those space cockroaches saved the Korath from themselves.`
			`	"We learned a lot from the Korath: even the most aggressive Unfettered are wary of attacking Hai planets, lest our species destroy itself like the Korath did. In all our raids in the Wah Ki system, never once have the Unfettered targeted civilian areas on Cloudfire." Batu appears shocked by this.`

They've been using these to spy on nearby traffic, including us. It's also... eh," he turns to Batu, "read that technical explanation again, Batu."`

			`	Batu nods and pulls up something on his datapad, which he recites mechanically. "The drone fleet acts as a phase array transceiver and hyperwave sounder. A phase array uses signals from multiple sources (the drones) transmitting or receiving slightly out of phase, to emulate a much larger antenna. It's the same principle as phase array radars used for meteorology and phase array telescopes for astronomy. Each drone's communication system is not much stronger than a human hyperspace relay, but the fleet acts together as one powerful relay. We think it's able to relay signals as far as 120 light-years, without the need for starlanes. What's most concerning is that relaying is only a secondary functionality; they're mostly observation systems.`
			`	He slides his finger across the pad and continues. "They were hard to detect, and have probably been hiding for years, perhaps decades. From debris analysis, we determined the drones are painted with a material that tricks human sensors, so seeing them is tough. Their transmissions are cleverly disguised as ambient noise, so you can't listen for them either. However, we've developed a quad tree search algorithm to find the probes. The algorithm detects everywhere the probes cannot be, and all that's left are probe locations." He looks up from his datapad at last.`
