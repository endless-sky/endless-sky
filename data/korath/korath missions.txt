The bleating noise returns, and you turn again, only to see the original Kor Efret has returned from around the corner. Whatever chance you had of getting out of this is gone now.`
			`	The one in front turns back to where it came from, and the Korath behind you hisses and gestures forward. It looks like you should follow. You brace yourself and turn the corner to see... animals?`
			`	The rusting buildings have given way to a massive abandoned plaza, and the entire space is taken up by a mix of large livestock and supplies. They remind you of sheep, but they're around five times larger, have six legs, and come in a variety of brown-black colors. Each has a full coat of fur and an additional blanket made of their own wool-like fabric on them. It's the same material these Korath are wearing. Even with their extra blanket, the "sheep" are huddled in small groups and look uncomfortably cold. They occasionally bleat loudly whenever a cold wind rushes through the plaza. Fortunately for you, these Kor Efreti look to be farmers, not muggers. This must have been the only place near the spaceport where they could keep their entire herd together.`
			`	The one who led you here, who also seems to be the leader, gestures for you to come over to it. It has opened a paper map - a rare sight in the era of interstellar travel. When you take a look, you realize it's not of the local area, but space; it seems to show the surrounding systems. The Korath points to one, pauses and gestures broadly at the mix of livestock and supplies, then draws its finger to another system and says something that sounds roughly like <planet>. "<planet>?" you confirm, and the Korath hisses in approval. It looks like they want transportation there. You wager the livestock and supplies will take up roughly <tons>, and there are <bunks> Korath farmers in the group.`
			`	It pulls a stack of 200 credits from its pocket and sets it on the ground before drawing a circle around it with a piece of chalk. It then draws four more, makes a large circle around the five total smaller ones, then draws nine additional large circles. Your best guess is it's offering 10,000 credits for their transport.`

			`	You indicate your agreement by pointing to <planet> on the map and gesturing to yourself.

When you arrive, it immediately goes to work spreading tarps over the floor and scattering a type of straw over them. After some time, you notice one of the "sheep" emerge from an alleyway led by a farmer that had stayed behind. Behind it is another animal, then another. The line of livestock, interspersed with the farmers keeping things moving, slowly makes it way into your hangar over the next hour.`
			`	As they enter your climate-controlled ship, the farmers take the hefty, wool-like blankets off the "sheep" and remove most of their own layers. One takes the entire pile of fabric to a nearby vendor and exchanges it for credits while the others go back and grab the supplies still in the plaza. By nightfall, everything and everyone is finally loaded onto your ship. The Korath who had sold the clothes to the merchant gives you the entire stack of 4,100 credits.

Based on how often they're in and out of the bathroom during the one-jump trip, none of them have been in hyperspace before. When they get over their space sickness, they busy themselves shaving the wool-like fur off the animals and gathering it.`
			`	As you land and open the cargo doors to reveal the hot world of <planet>, the animals shift excitedly. They seem much more energetic than any time before now, so much so that the Korath have some trouble keeping them all together as they exit the ship. The slow desertification of this planet is surely a cause for concern, but it seems to provide a much healthier environment for these animals than Setar Fort's chilling temperatures do. Once everything is off your ship, a Korath takes the wool to another vendor and again sells it, then it returns and hands you 5,900 credits. With the 4,100 credits it gave you before leaving, you've received all 10,000 promised credits. It holds its hands up with its palms toward you then leaves to join the other farmers.`

Reconfigured the shields to act as a plow to get out of the storm. That shield configuration should allow safe transit through the atmosphere in another landing attempt."
			`As you descend through the magnetosphere, your computer warns you of a build-up of unusual charged particles called muons, which is a bit odd. From your training on hyperspace exit and entrance, you recall that the mean lifetime of a muon is measured in microseconds. Something here must be actively generating them.`
			`	You travel deeper into the atmosphere, approaching what appears to be an inactive volcanic island chain. As usual, your ship's descent causes air currents, but the strange atmosphere turns those currents into a powerful storm. The muons mix with this event, creating catastrophic explosions of electrical discharge.`
			`	Remembering what you've read about extreme atmospheric landings, you reconfigure your shields to act as a plow, pushing through the storm. At first it isn't enough, so you pull upward, hoping the lower atmospheric density will let you escape. Once you're free, you realize you've already reached the exosphere.`
			`	A quick analysis by your ship's computer tells you the shield plow technique should get you all the way down to the surface, if you avoid eddies in the magnetosphere. It seems those eddies interact with the carbon star in an odd manner that produces vast amounts of muons. Your shield was drawing them in and discharging them, creating an intense storm centered on your ship. The plow shape directed the electrical activity aft, letting you move freely.`

Your shield plow technique took you down to the lower troposphere, where the storms cleared enough for you to see. The original island chain was too far away, so you set course for another one nearby.`
			`	Aiming for the hardest-looking piece of ground your sensors can find, you touch down. As this planet has twice Earth's gravity, you extend your ship's artificial gravity field to the surface. Donning a space suit for safety's sake, you walk out to see nature taking control once again: the massive volcano in front of you starts to erupt.`

			`On your third attempt, you dodge most of the storms by flying into the atmosphere at an odd angle that keeps you in stable air nearly the whole way. After a long flight through safe atmosphere, you finally reach the bay and land on a durable mesa overlooking it. Extending your ship's artificial gravity field to the surface, you don your suit and walk out. It quickly becomes clear the mesa is artificial: it's a constructed landing pad for a ship of vast scale.`
			`	This is the perfect location for life, so it's no surprise there are small plants and a few fish in the water. The seas are calmer here than the rest of the planet, and an unusual formation in the ionosphere protects this spot from the worst rays of the carbon star. The dominant land-based lifeform seems to be toothed worms about the size of your arm.`
			`	The strangest feature is what appears to be slow-moving islands. As one comes closer, its form is more clear: an unholy marriage between a blue whale and a giant squid. On the far end of the mesa, you spy a gravity crane system that looks suitable for carrying such a beast out of the water.`
