			`	The rusting buildings have given way to a massive abandoned plaza, and the entire space is taken up by a mix of large livestock and supplies. They remind you of sheep, but they're around five times larger, have six legs, and come in a variety of brown-black colors. Each has a full coat of fur and an additional blanket made of their own wool-like fabric on them. It's the same material these Korath are wearing. Even with their extra blanket, the "sheep" are huddled in small groups and look uncomfortably cold. They occasionally bleat loudly whenever a cold wind rushes through the plaza. Fortunately for you, these Kor Efreti look to be farmers, not muggers. This must have been the only place near the spaceport where they could keep their entire herd together.`

When you take a look, you realize it's not of the local area, but space; it seems to show the surroundings systems. The Korath points to one, pauses and gestures broadly at the mix of livestock and supplies, then draws its finger to another system and says something that sounds roughly like <planet>. "<planet>?" you confirm, and the Korath hisses in approval. It looks like they want transportation there. You wager the livestock and supplies will take up roughly <tons>, and there are <bunks> Korath farmers in the group.`
			`	It pulls a stack of 200 credits from its pocket and sets it on the ground before drawing a circle around it with a piece of chalk.

When you arrive, it immediately goes to work spreading tarps over the floor and scattering a type of straw over them. After some time, you notice one of the "sheep" emerge from an alleyway led by a farmer that had stayed behind. Behind it is another animal, then another. The line of livestock, interspersed with the farmers keeping things moving, slowly makes it way into your hangar over the next hour.`
			`	As they enter your climate-controlled ship, the farmers take the hefty, wool-like blankets off the "sheep" and remove most of their own layers. One takes the entire pile of fabric to a nearby vendor and exchanges it for credits while the others go back and grab the supplies still in the plaza. By nightfall, everything and everyone is finally loaded onto your ship. The Korath who had sold the clothes to the merchant gives you the entire stack of 4,100 credits.

Based on how often they're in and out of the bathroom during the one-jump trip, none of them have been in hyperspace before. When they get over their space sickness, they busy themselves shaving the wool-like fur off the animals and gathering it.`
			`	As you land and open the cargo doors to reveal the hot world of <planet>, the animals shift excitedly. They seem much more energetic than any time before now, so much so that the Korath have some trouble keeping them all together as they exit the ship. The slow desertification of this planet is surely a cause for concern, but it seems to provide a much healthier environment for these animals than Setar Fort's chilling temperatures do. Once everything is off your ship, a Korath takes the wool to another vendor and again sells it, then it returns and hands you 5,900 credits. With the 4,100 credits it gave you before leaving, you've received all 10,000 promised credits. It holds its hands up with its palms toward you then leaves to join the other farmers.`

As usual, your ship's descent causes air currents, but the strange atmosphere turns those currents into a powerful storm. The muons mix with this event, creating catastrophic explosions of electrical discharge.`

At first it isn't enough, so you pull upward, hoping the lower atmospheric density will let you escape. Once you're free, you realize you've already reached the exosphere.`
			`	A quick analysis by your ship's computer tells you the shield plow technique should get you all the way down to the surface, if you avoid eddies in the magnetosphere.

Your shield was drawing them in and discharging them, creating an intense storm centered on your ship. The plow shape directed the electrical activity aft, letting you move freely.`

That is, unless their terrible weapons annihilate the corpses, or if the enemies aren't Korath at all. We do what we can to mediate their troubles with humans, but we aren't always around."`

			`	"There are few life-supporting planets in the systems where the Korath are exiled. One is the violent planet you visited: Rabasot Pa'ah. The Korath discovered New Tortuga has a similar environment, but it had evolved macroscopic life. The creature you found, the Pwason Gra, attracted them.`
			`	"They could not grow the creatures from an egg either artificially or on Rabasot Pa'ah, because the larval form requires very specific conditions. However, the juvenile and adult forms thrive on Rabasot Pa'ah, growing far larger than on New Tortuga. That means they need a steady supply of juveniles for transport. The conditions of their exile prevented the Korath from fishing on New Tortuga themselves, so they had to make a deal with humans.`
			`	"Not understanding our society, they talked to the first fishers they found, who couldn't help them, because those fishers were slaves. To Korath, self-expression is a religion and almost a biological necessity. Slavery to them is as abhorrent as," she thinks for a moment, "consuming the skin of dead relatives is to us.`
			`	"They made a deal: freedom for fish. The Korath provided rifles in secret, and the slaves drove their masters off the planet. Ex-Syndicate refugees who fled persecution to live here helped us form a functioning government. Now, we give juvenile fish to the Korath, and they assist us in industry, mining, food production, and defense of our systems.`
			`	"We invited them - no, we asked them - to live on New Tortuga with us, to share our homes and be family. Sadly, their oppressors have forbidden them from setting foot on planets outside their exiled systems. Although we have occasional visits of technicians or doctors to New Tortuga, no Korath has stayed for more than a few days. Never has a military vessel touched down.`
			`	"I fear this traumatic first contact has scarred their view of humans. They despise the Syndicate, for its anti-religion policies; and pirates, for enslavement. The vastness of our species makes them fearful, despite their technological superiority. I fear broader peaceful relations between humans and Korath will be many years away.`

			# Iris's explanation is extremely biased because her primary source

			`	"The imperialist Drak race sent living weapons, the Archons, to conquer the Korath under the guise of protection. The Archons' antimatter weapons and seeming invincibility was too much, until the Korath gathered a larger fleet. When they managed to injure one Archon, the others revealed frightening powers. They tore open rifts in reality, simply swallowing up Korath ships. Hidden super-weapons in planetoids, intended as mines, were harmless, as the Archons shattered the planetoids and atomized the weapons. In every battle, all Korath military ships were destroyed, but the civilians were somehow unscathed.`
			`	"The Korath saw certain defeat, and in surrender the Drak offered two options. The Korath may give up their religions and live as pets of their own former friends, the Quarg. Or, they could keep their religions and live in starving exile near us.`
			# The "YOU" in all caps is to indicate Iris is briefly raising her voice. Iris momentarily departs from the calm and kind persona she usually displays because she's infuriated beyond reason. This unusual departure from the typical Endless Sky writing rules is to emphasize the importance of what you did wrong.
			`	"The Drak left the exiles with a warning: destroy Far'en Lai, and we will kill you all. You may never leave exile until you heal that planet and live there peacefully. As a precaution, and almost as a religion, they forbid weapons on that planet. A condition YOU violated." She looks heated for a moment before continuing.`
			`	"As to their guardianship over us, it violates the letter of the law, but not the intent. The Korath hope this protection of the innocent will temper the Drak's rage. Along with defending us against major attacks, they have provided extensive assistance. Their aid - at our insistence - has been purely civilian: Anything we receive, the Syndicate may somehow obtain, and I shudder to think of what they may do with the wrong knowledge."`
