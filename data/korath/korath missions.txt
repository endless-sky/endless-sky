			`	The rusting buildings have given way to a massive abandoned plaza, and the entire space is taken up by a mix of large livestock and supplies. They remind you of sheep, but they're around five times larger, have six legs, and come in a variety of brown-black colors. Each has a full coat of fur and an additional blanket made of their own wool-like fabric on them. It's the same material these Korath are wearing. Even with their extra blanket, the "sheep" are huddled in small groups and look uncomfortably cold. They occasionally bleat loudly whenever a cold wind rushes through the plaza. Fortunately for you, these Kor Efreti look to be farmers, not muggers. This must have been the only place near the spaceport where they could keep their entire herd together.`
			`	The one who led you here, who also seems to be the leader, gestures for you to come over to it. It has opened a paper map - a rare sight in the era of interstellar travel. When you take a look, you realize it's not of the local area, but space; it seems to show the surroundings systems. The Korath points to one, pauses and gestures broadly at the mix of livestock and supplies, then draws its finger to another system and says something that sounds roughly like <planet>. "<planet>?" you confirm, and the Korath hisses in approval. It looks like they want transportation there. You wager the livestock and supplies will take up roughly <tons>, and there are <bunks> Korath farmers in the group.`
			`	It pulls a stack of 200 credits from its pocket and sets it on the ground before drawing a circle around it with a piece of chalk. It then draws four more, makes a large circle around the five total smaller ones, then draws nine additional large circles. Your best guess is it's offering 10,000 credits for their transport.`

When you arrive, it immediately goes to work spreading tarps over the floor and scattering a type of straw over them. After some time, you notice one of the "sheep" emerge from an alleyway led by a farmer that had stayed behind. Behind it is another animal, then another. The line of livestock, interspersed with the farmers keeping things moving, slowly makes it way into your hangar over the next hour.`
			`	As they enter your climate-controlled ship, the farmers take the hefty, wool-like blankets off the "sheep" and remove most of their own layers. One takes the entire pile of fabric to a nearby vendor and exchanges it for credits while the others go back and grab the supplies still in the plaza. By nightfall, everything and everyone is finally loaded onto your ship. The Korath who had sold the clothes to the merchant gives you the entire stack of 4,100 credits.

Based on how often they're in and out of the bathroom during the one-jump trip, none of them have been in hyperspace before. When they get over their space sickness, they busy themselves shaving the wool-like fur off the animals and gathering it.`
			`	As you land and open the cargo doors to reveal the hot world of <planet>, the animals shift excitedly. They seem much more energetic than any time before now, so much so that the Korath have some trouble keeping them all together as they exit the ship. The slow desertification of this planet is surely a cause for concern, but it seems to provide a much healthier environment for these animals than Setar Fort's chilling temperatures do. Once everything is off your ship, a Korath takes the wool to another vendor and again sells it, then it returns and hands you 5,900 credits. With the 4,100 credits it gave you before leaving, you've received all 10,000 promised credits. It holds its hands up with its palms toward you then leaves to join the other farmers.`

Reconfiguring the shields to act as a plow got me out of the storm. That shield configuration should allow safe transit through the atmosphere in my next landing attempt."
			`As you descend through the magnetosphere, your computer warns you of a build-up of unusual charged particles, muons, which is a strange warning, considering the mean lifetime of a muon is measured in microseconds. You travel deeper into the atmosphere, approaching what appears to be an inactive volcanic island chain. As usual, your ship's descent causes air currents, but the strange atmosphere turns those currents into a powerful storm. The muons mix with this event, creating catastrophic explosions of electrical discharge.`
			`	Remembering the class you took on extreme atmospheric landings, you reconfigure your shields to act as a plow, pushing through the storm. At first, it isn't enough, so you pull upward, hoping the lower atmospheric density will let you escape. Once you're free, you realize you've already reached the exosphere. For once, those 50,000 credits of pilot training don't seem like a waste of money.`
			`	A quick analysis by your ship's computer tells you the shield plow technique should get you all the way down to the surface, if you avoid eddies in the magnetosphere. It seems those eddies interact with the nova in an odd manner that produces vast amounts of muons, which ride your ship through the atmosphere.`
			`	Certainly, a second landing attempt will get you through the atmosphere. Next, you'll have to scout for a safe place to land on this world of water and storms.`

A volcanic eruption nearly hit the ship, and it may have been caused by landing on an inopportune spot. There is a large island - or small continent - that looks suitable for landing. My next landing attempt should succeed."
			`In this trip, your ship's descent stirred up awe-inspiring storm clouds, but traveling through them was easy. Your shield plow technique took you down to the lower troposphere, where the storms cleared enough for you to see. The original island chain was too far away, so you set course for a larger island nearby.`
			`	Aiming for a hard-looking piece of ground, you touch down. As this planet has twice Earth's gravity, you extend your ship's artificial gravity field to the surface. Donning a space suit for safety's sake, you walk out to see nature taking control once again: the massive volcano in front of you starts to erupt.`
			`	After a dash to the cockpit, still in your suit, you take off, satisfied that you've reached the surface - albeit in the worst possible spot. A third attempt will certainly succeed, as you saw a small continent with no apparent volcanic activity, and a pleasant-looking bay.`

			`On your third attempt, you dodge most of the storms by flying into the atmosphere at an odd angle that keeps you in stable air nearly the whole way. After a long flight through safe atmosphere, you finally reach the bay and land on a durable mesa overlooking it. Extending your ship's artificial gravity field to the surface, you don your ship and walk out.`
			`	This is the perfect location for life, so it's no surprise there are small plants and a few fish in the water. The seas are calmer here than the rest of the planet and an unusual formation in the ionosphere protects this spot from the worst rays of the nova. The dominant land-based lifeform seems to be toothed worms about the size of your arm.`
			`	The strangest feature is what appears to be slow-moving islands. As one comes closer, its form is more clear: an unholy marriage between a blue whale and a giant squid. Given the vast difference in size between those creatures and anything else you've seen on the planet, it is unlikely they evolved here. Has someone been shipping giant whale-squid to this bay?`

That is, unless their terrible weapons annihilate the corpses, or if the enemies aren't Korath at all. We do what we can to mediate their troubles with humans, but we aren't always around."`

			`	"There are few life-supporting planets in the systems where the Korath have been exiled. One is a quite violent planet you visited: Rabasot Pa'ah. The Korath discovered New Tortuga has a similar, though less violent, environment and did evolve macroscopic life, including a fish-like species that would be an excellent food source.`
			`	"Unfortunately, they could not grow the creatures on Rabasot Pa'ah, or artificially, since the larval form requires very specific conditions. The juvenile and adult forms thrive on Rabasot Pa'ah, growing far larger than on New Tortuga. The conditions of their exile prevented the Korath from fishing on New Tortuga themselves, so they had to make a deal with humans.`
			`	"Not understanding our society, they talked to the first fishers they found, who couldn't help them, because those fishers were slaves. To Korath, self-expression is a religion and almost a biological necessity. Slavery to them is as abhorrent as," she thinks for a moment, "consuming the skin of dead relatives is to us.`
			`	"They made a deal: freedom for fish. The Korath provided rifles and air support, while the slaves drove their masters off the planet. After that, the ex-Syndicate refugees, fleeing persecution, helped us form a functioning government. We give juvenile fish to the Korath, and they see to our safety and basic needs.`
			`	"We invited them - no, we asked them - to live on New Tortuga with us, to share our homes and be family. Sadly, their oppressors have forbidden them from setting foot on planets outside their exiled systems. Although we have occasional visits of technicians or doctors to New Tortuga, no Korath has stayed for more than a few days. Never has a military vessel touched down.`
			`	"I fear this traumatic first contact has scarred their view of humans. They despise the Syndicate, for its anti-religion policies; and pirates, for enslavement. The vastness of our species makes them fearful, despite their technological superiority. I fear broader peaceful relations between humans and Korath will be many years away.`

			# Iris's explanation is extremely biased because her primary source

			# the Exiles' feelings about their own fate.
			`	"An imperialist race called the Drak sent living weapons, the Archons, to conquer the Korath under the guise of protection. The Archons' antimatter weapons and seeming invincibility was too much at first, until the Korath gathered a larger fleet. When they managed to injure one Archon, the others revealed frightening powers. They tore open rifts in reality, simply swallowing up Korath ships. Hidden super-weapons in planetoids, intended as mines, were harmless, as the Archons shattered the planetoids and atomized the weapons. In every battle, all Korath military ships were destroyed, but the civilians were somehow unscathed.`
			`	"The Korath saw certain defeat, and in surrender the Drak offered two options. They can give up their religion and live as the pets of their former friends, the Quarg. Or, they could keep their religions and live in starving exile near us.`
			`	"Archons left the exiles with a warning: destroy Far'en Lei, and we will kill you all. You may never leave exile until you heal that planet and live there peacefully. As a precaution, and almost as a religion, they forbid weapons on that planet. A condition YOU violated." She looks heated for a moment before continuing.`
			`	"As to their guardianship over us, it violates the letter of the law, but not the intent. The Korath believe the Drak will look favorably upon them for protecting the weak. Their aid - at our insistence - has been purely non-military, except to defend us against major attacks. They lack foresight to restrict what they share, as if they didn't understand the consequence of giving powerful weapons to a younger race. Anything we receive, the Syndicate may somehow obtain, and I shudder to think of the damage those monsters would do with Korath weapons."`
