			`	The one in front turns back to where it came from, and the Korath behind you hisses and gestures forward. It looks like you should follow. You brace yourself and turn the corner to see... animals?`
			`	The rusting buildings have given way to a massive abandoned plaza, and the entire space is taken up by a mix of large livestock and supplies. They remind you of sheep, but they're around five times larger, have six legs, and come in a variety of brown-black colors. Each has a full coat of fur and an additional blanket made of their own wool-like fabric on them. It's the same material these Korath are wearing. Even with their extra blanket, the "sheep" are huddled in small groups and look uncomfortably cold. They occasionally bleat loudly whenever a cold wind rushes through the plaza. Fortunately for you, these Kor Efreti look to be farmers, not muggers. This must have been the only place near the spaceport where they could keep their entire herd together.`
			`	The one who led you here, who also seems to be the leader, gestures for you to come over to it. It has opened a paper map - a rare sight in the era of interstellar travel. When you take a look, you realize it's not of the local area, but space; it seems to show the surroundings systems. The Korath points to one, pauses and gestures broadly at the mix of livestock and supplies, then draws its finger to another system and says something that sounds roughly like <planet>. "<planet>?" you confirm, and the Korath hisses in approval. It looks like they want transportation there. You wager the livestock and supplies will take up roughly <tons>, and there are <bunks> Korath farmers in the group.`
			`	It pulls a stack of 200 credits from its pocket and sets it on the ground before drawing a circle around it with a piece of chalk. It then draws four more, makes a large circle around the five total smaller ones, then draws nine additional large circles. Your best guess is it's offering 10,000 credits for their transport.`

When you arrive, it immediately goes to work spreading tarps over the floor and scattering a type of straw over them. After some time, you notice one of the "sheep" emerge from an alleyway led by a farmer that had stayed behind. Behind it is another animal, then another. The line of livestock, interspersed with the farmers keeping things moving, slowly makes it way into your hangar over the next hour.`
			`	As they enter your climate-controlled ship, the farmers take the hefty, wool-like blankets off the "sheep" and remove most of their own layers. One takes the entire pile of fabric to a nearby vendor and exchanges it for credits while the others go back and grab the supplies still in the plaza. By nightfall, everything and everyone is finally loaded onto your ship. The Korath who had sold the clothes to the merchant gives you the entire stack of 4,100 credits.

Based on how often they're in and out of the bathroom during the one-jump trip, none of them have been in hyperspace before. When they get over their space sickness, they busy themselves shaving the wool-like fur off the animals and gathering it.`
			`	As you land and open the cargo doors to reveal the hot world of <planet>, the animals shift excitedly. They seem much more energetic than any time before now, so much so that the Korath have some trouble keeping them all together as they exit the ship. The slow desertification of this planet is surely a cause for concern, but it seems to provide a much healthier environment for these animals than Setar Fort's chilling temperatures do. Once everything is off your ship, a Korath takes the wool to another vendor and again sells it, then it returns and hands you 5,900 credits. With the 4,100 credits it gave you before leaving, you've received all 10,000 promised credits. It holds its hands up with its palms toward you then leaves to join the other farmers.`

			`	A furious exchange of gestures and vocalisations ensues between the two korath, and they begin furiously drawing, erasing, and drawing more things in the sand between themselves, out of your sight. Eventually, the pace of their conversation slows and they turn back to you.`
			`	They draw your ships back on the illustration of the planet, pick up the sand for your ship, and throw it back in human space again.  Then, they collect a few pebbles from human space, redraw your ship back on the planet again, and place the pebbles inside. Picking up one of the pebbles, one of them reaches into its coat, takes out a glowing red orb, unscrews a cap from the top, and drinks the thick, red fluid.  They gesture with the pebble, gesture with the now-empty orb, and place all the pebbles on the drawing of the planet between your three ships.`

			`	"Lasel," says the Korath, and it stretches out both arms toward you, fingers curled back towards its body. You make the same gesture, and they reverse their hands, linking their scaly fingers with yours.  You're not sure if that is the right response, but the Korath seem satisfied, saying, "Nik lak'mal." They get back in their fighters and take off, cirlcling above you.`

			`As you descend through the magnetosphere, your computer warns you of a build-up of unusual charged particles, muons, which is a strange warning, considering the mean lifetime of a muon is measured in microseconds. You travel deeper into the atmosphere, approaching what appears to be an inactive volcanic island chain. As usual, your ship's descent causes air currents, but the strange atmosphere turns those currents into a powerful storm. The muons mix with this event, creating catastrophic explosions of electrical discharge.`
			`	Remembering the class you took on extreme atmospheric landings, you reconfigure your shields to act as a plow, pushing through the storm. At first, it isn't enough, so you pull upward, hoping the lower atmospheric density will let you escape. Once you're free, you realize you've already reached the exosphere. For once, those 50,000 credits of pilot training don't seem like a waste of money.`
			`	A quick analysis by your ship's computer tells you the shield plow technique should get you all the way down to the surface, if you avoid eddies in the magnetosphere. It seems those eddies interact with the nova in an odd manner that produces vast amounts of muons, which ride your ship through the atmosphere.`
			`	Certainly, a second landing attempt will get you through the atmosphere. Next, you'll have to scout for a safe place to land on this world of water and storms.`

			`In this trip, your ship's descent stirred up awe-inspiring storm clouds, but traveling through them was easy. Your shield plow technique took you down to the lower troposphere, where the storms cleared enough for you to see. The original island chain was too far away, so you set course for a larger island nearby.`
			`	Aiming for a hard-looking piece of ground, you touch down. As this planet has twice Earth's gravity, you extend your ship's artificial gravity field to the surface. Donning a space suit for safety's sake, you walk out to see nature taking control once again: the massive volcano in front of you starts to erupt.`
			`	After a dash to the cockpit, still in your suit, you take off, satisfied that you've reached the surface - albeit in the worst possible spot. A third attempt will certainly succeed, as you saw a small continent with no apparent volcanic activity, and a pleasant-looking bay.`

			`On your third attempt, you dodge most of the storms by flying into the atmosphere at an odd angle that keeps you in stable air nearly the whole way. After a long flight through safe atmosphere, you finally reach the bay and land on a durable mesa overlooking it. Extending your ship's artificial gravity field to the surface, you don your ship and walk out.`
			`	This is the perfect location for life, so it's no surprise there are small plants and a few fish in the water. The seas are calmer here than the rest of the planet and an unusual formation in the ionosphere protects this spot from the worst rays of the nova. The dominant land-based lifeform seems to be toothed worms about the size of your arm.`
			`	The strangest feature is what appears to be slow-moving islands. As one comes closer, its form is more clear: an unholy marriage between a blue whale and a giant squid. Given the vast difference in size between those creatures and anything else you've seen on the planet, it is unlikely they evolved here. Has someone been shipping giant whale-squid to this bay?`
