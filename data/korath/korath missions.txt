The bleating noise returns, and you turn again, only to see the original Kor Efret has returned from around the corner. Whatever chance you had of getting out of this is gone now.`
			`	The one in front turns back to where it came from, and the Korath behind you hisses and gestures forward. It looks like you should follow. You brace yourself and turn the corner to see... animals?`
			`	The rusting buildings have given way to a massive abandoned plaza, and the entire space is taken up by a mix of large livestock and supplies. They remind you of sheep, but they're around five times larger, have six legs, and come in a variety of brown-black colors. Each has a full coat of fur and an additional blanket made of their own wool-like fabric on them. It's the same material these Korath are wearing. Even with their extra blanket, the "sheep" are huddled in small groups and look uncomfortably cold. They occasionally bleat loudly whenever a cold wind rushes through the plaza. Fortunately for you, these Kor Efreti look to be farmers, not muggers. This must have been the only place near the spaceport where they could keep their entire herd together.`
			`	The one who led you here, who also seems to be the leader, gestures for you to come over to it. It has opened a paper map - a rare sight in the era of interstellar travel. When you take a look, you realize it's not of the local area, but space; it seems to show the surrounding systems. The Korath points to one, pauses and gestures broadly at the mix of livestock and supplies, then draws its finger to another system and says something that sounds roughly like <planet>. "<planet>?" you confirm, and the Korath hisses in approval. It looks like they want transportation there. You wager the livestock and supplies will take up roughly <tons>, and there are <bunks> Korath farmers in the group.`
			`	It pulls a stack of 200 credits from its pocket and sets it on the ground before drawing a circle around it with a piece of chalk. It then draws four more, makes a large circle around the five total smaller ones, then draws nine additional large circles. Your best guess is it's offering 10,000 credits for their transport.`

			`	You indicate your agreement by pointing to <planet> on the map and gesturing to yourself.

When you arrive, it immediately goes to work spreading tarps over the floor and scattering a type of straw over them. After some time, you notice one of the "sheep" emerge from an alleyway led by a farmer that had stayed behind. Behind it is another animal, then another. The line of livestock, interspersed with the farmers keeping things moving, slowly makes it way into your hangar over the next hour.`
			`	As they enter your climate-controlled ship, the farmers take the hefty, wool-like blankets off the "sheep" and remove most of their own layers. One takes the entire pile of fabric to a nearby vendor and exchanges it for credits while the others go back and grab the supplies still in the plaza. By nightfall, everything and everyone is finally loaded onto your ship. The Korath who had sold the clothes to the merchant gives you the entire stack of 4,100 credits.

Based on how often they're in and out of the bathroom during the one-jump trip, none of them have been in hyperspace before. When they get over their space sickness, they busy themselves shaving the wool-like fur off the animals and gathering it.`
			`	As you land and open the cargo doors to reveal the hot world of <planet>, the animals shift excitedly. They seem much more energetic than any time before now, so much so that the Korath have some trouble keeping them all together as they exit the ship. The slow desertification of this planet is surely a cause for concern, but it seems to provide a much healthier environment for these animals than Setar Fort's chilling temperatures do. Once everything is off your ship, a Korath takes the wool to another vendor and again sells it, then it returns and hands you 5,900 credits. With the 4,100 credits it gave you before leaving, you've received all 10,000 promised credits. It holds its hands up with its palms toward you then leaves to join the other farmers.`

			`A crowd pours out of the spaceport when you land. It takes some time for the workers to establish barricades and clear a path so the transports can get to your cargo hold. A team in uniform greets you formally when you open the hatch, and you count the coffins together with them. Afterwards, you show them the boxes of possessions, which they handle with care. An officer thanks you and hands you a data chip that vaguely reminds you of a license.`
			`	The crowd has been somber, but when the first coffin leaves your ship, they erupt in a cacophony of barking sounds. Some Korath try to rush forward but are held back by others, presumably their family.`
			`	Rather than intrude on their grief, you return to your ship, slotting the data chip you received into your systems. Unfortunately, the information is in an alien language, so you set it aside and work on a plan to salvage the <EDC-ship>. Gathering some notes on the ship and the number of crew they were carrying, it's clear that you will need to carry at least 66 additional crew that you can communicate with to be able to salvage it. The closest system that comes to mind with many human speakers is on Greenwater, in Hai space.`

A Korath in some kind of robe stands next to a table piled with sweets and cups of some kind of thick drink. As you approach, you realize that the "choir" is made of holograms. You do a quick mental count and guess that these are the Korath that died on the ship; this is probably some type of memorial. The Korath in robes greets you and presses a cup into your hand.`

			`	You return to your ship and try plugging the chip into your systems again, which now displays two files: one in the Korath language, and one in your own. You open the file in your language, and it reads: "The <EDC-ship> is a ship of grief, bringing great pain in memories that sing for generations. Love is a void in the souls of many. Know all that <first> <last> is a true Efret by heart, if not by skin. The <EDC-ship> is theirs, to save lives and keep memories."`
