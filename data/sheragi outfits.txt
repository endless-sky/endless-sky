# Outfits

outfit "Electromagnetic Battery"
	category "Power"
	cost 1000000
	thumbnail "outfit/embattery"
	"mass" 150
	"outfit space" -150
	"shield generation" 0.8
	"shield energy" 0.8
	"shield heat" 0.8
	"energy capacity" 20000
	description `This is a massive superconductive coil, capable of storing large amounts of energy in a magnetic field and discharging all of it in a fraction of a second. The magnetic field also provides a small boost to the shield regeneration of the ship, which is otherwise very underdeveloped.`

	"flare sound" "atomic huge"
	unplunderable 1
	description `The Sheragi engines are much more than simple tubes spitting fire; they are a collection of interdependent devices, providing increased efficiency at the cost of modularity. This includes a hyperdrive, a huge fusion reactor, and the most powerful plasma engines you've ever seen. All simple technology, but enhanced to their extremes. The engines are fundamentally connected to the fusion reactor, increasing their thrust even further and thereby allowing the Emerald Sword to fly at impressive speeds and travel interstellar space with relative ease.`

outfit "Sheragi Cooling Unit"
	category "Systems"
	cost 1000000
	thumbnail "outfit/sheragicooling"
	"mass" 40
	"outfit space" -40
	"active cooling" 142
	"cooling energy" 16.2
	description `This Sheragi cooling system is primitive at best, but it is active rather than passive, allowing it to dissipate much more heat than a simple radiator would. It drains a lot of power when subjected to the heat of battle, though.`

outfit "Damaged Sheragi Systems"
	category "Special"

	thumbnail "outfit/unknown"
	"shields" -2000
	"hull" -6000
	"energy consumption" 3
	"heat generation" 4
	"jump drive" -1
	unplunderable 1
	description "There is a lot of broken Sheragi hardware in here. You need to fix that before you can take the ship back into Human space."


# Weapons

		"firing fuel" 300
		"hull damage" 9000
		"piercing" 0.3
		"heat damage" 40000
		"hit force" 2000
	description "This ancient Sheragi superweapon is simple in concept, but the cost involved in developing something like it is prohibitive, and it's hard to imagine what could motivate the creation of such a thing. It uses an obscene amount of energy to create an extremely powerful fusion reaction, and directs most of the energy of the explosion forwards in a devastatingly powerful beam of gamma radiation."

outfit "Sheragi Anti-Missile"
	category "Turrets"
	cost 845000
	thumbnail "outfit/sheragiam"
	"mass" 35
	"outfit space" -35
	"weapon capacity" -35
	"turret mounts" -1
	weapon
		"hardpoint sprite" "hardpoint/sheragiam"

		"anti-missile" 200
		"velocity" 450
		"lifetime" 1
		"reload" 60
		"firing energy" 220
		"firing heat" 440
	description "The Sheragi anti-missile system fires an extremely powerful laser pulse capable of obliterating any missile in a single shot, but takes a long time to recharge. It was probably made to counter nuclear missiles."

outfit "Particle Waveform Turret"
	category "Turrets"
	cost 1650000
	thumbnail "outfit/pwave turret"
	"mass" 47
	"outfit space" -47
	"weapon capacity" -47
	"turret mounts" -1
	"required crew" 1

		sprite "projectile/pwavecannon"
			"frame rate" 20

		"hit effect" "pwave impact"
		"inaccuracy" 1.5

		"firing heat" 651
		"shield damage" 110
		"hull damage" 270
		"heat damage" 1344
		"turret turn" 1.8
	description "This ancient Sheragi turret accelerates a dense packet of electrons that, while very ineffective against any kind of shielding, has a very long range and easily melts through matter. By the nature of these weapons, one can deduce their tactic was to hit with the Dragonflame Cannon at long range to break the enemy shields and finish them off in relatively closer range with the Particle Waveform Cannon."
