	description "Once they left human space, it became apparent to the Remnant that they would need to build their own shipyards in order to defend themselves if they were discovered by the Alphas or any other unfriendly faction. Using new composite materials that they discovered, they built ships very different from anything seen in human space."

	description "While the Starling was the first successful ship to use technology derived from alien ruins, the Gull is the most recent. The current increase in Korath activities has caused foraging for resources to become a risky endeavor, forcing the Remnant to develop a specialized freighter for hauling cargo from remote sites without revealing their presence to hostile aliens."
	description "	The Gull has quickly proven its worth, allowing the Starling fleets to return to riskier activities while the Gull takes over the hazardous convoy routes. It is now the primary element of the Remnant's extra-territorial resource operations."
	description "	The cloaking technology is built into the Gull's hull; it cannot be removed or transferred to another ship."

	description "This is the Ibis, a multipurpose carrier that serves as a mining platform for terns, as an escort ship for pelican fleets, and a combat platform for terns used in screening roles. It is capable of fielding a single wing of support craft, consisting of two petrels and four terns."
	description "	The Ibis was designed shortly after the albatross as a means of extending the range of their resource collection efforts after the Remnant realized that an Alpha invsion might not be as imminent as original thought."

	description "The Pelican is closely based on the original semi-organic materials the Remnant found in the Ember Waste. While they are not technically alive, their internal mechanisms and method of construction bear such a close resemblance to living organisms that they are often considered as such. One key feature of this living resemblence is the innate sensory capabilities they posses, akin to sensor suites less advanced ships require for detailed scanning. These ships serve as the backbone of Remnant bulk salvage efforts, as well as their fast-logistics distribution network."

	description "The Petrel is a multi-role mining/wing leader fightercraft designed to give remnant a forward control position for flights of Terns in higher risk or quickly changing environments. Their initial design was used as a urban mobile gun platform that flitted around structures, caverns, and natural terrain on their worlds while fighting on-planet threats."
	description "	Due to the comparatively small pool the Remnant draw on for pilots and crew they are loath to throw mass waves of people into the line of fire. As such, their fighters are not intended to be up-close glass cannons like most other factions of humanity tend to build. Instead, these ships are highly agile fighters equipped with medium range weaponry designed to snipe enemies from behind cover."

	description "The Tern is a small, hardy drone developed to plunge into the atmosphere of nearby gas giants to collect valuable resources for the nearby Remnant worlds. As a result, these tough, thick shelled craft are surprisingly effective at providing distraction and covering fire when enemies intrude on Remnant space."
	description "	Unlike most empires, the Remnant do not have sufficient people to pilot fighter wings in waves likely to sustain significant casualties. As such, they frequently use these hardy drones to fulfill similar screening roles in their home systems, allowing manned craft to focus on more specialized tasks."
