	description "Once they left human space, it became apparent to the Remnant that they would need to build their own shipyards in order to defend themselves if they were discovered by the Alphas or any other unfriendly faction. Using new composite materials that they discovered, they built ships very different from anything seen in human space."

	description "Centuries ago, the Remnant built these ships in order to explore the upper atmosphere of nearby gas giants. The Archons took issue with the Remnant's research methods, and the studies were unable to be completed. The remaining gascraft have been gathering dust in storage for centuries while the Remnant wait to see if the anger of the Archons will subside."

	description "While the Starling was the first successful ship to use technology derived from alien ruins, the Gull is the most recent. The current increase in Korath activities has caused foraging for resources to become a risky endeavor, forcing the Remnant to develop a specialized freighter for hauling cargo from remote sites without revealing their presence to hostile aliens."
	description "	The Gull has quickly proven its worth, allowing the Starling fleets to return to riskier activities while the Gull takes over the hazardous convoy routes. It is now the primary element of the Remnant's extra-territorial resource operations."
	description "	The cloaking technology is built into the Gull's hull; it cannot be removed or transferred to another ship."

	description "The Pelican is closely based on the original semi-organic materials the Remnant found in the Ember Waste. While they are not technically alive, their internal mechanisms and method of construction bear such a close resemblance to living organisms that they are often considered as such. These ships serve as the backbone of Remnant salvage efforts, as well as their resource distribution network."

	description "One of the strangest and most useful things that the Remnant discovered in the abandoned worlds of the Ember Waste is alien cloaking technology. They designed their scout ships to be able to cloak when needed, in order to explore alien territory without being seen... or to escape in a hurry after stealing something particularly valuable from those aliens."
