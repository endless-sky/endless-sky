	description "This compact coilgun fires a stream of hypervelocity projectiles, accelerating them on a traveling wave of magnetic energy as capacitors are discharged through a series of coils. Designed primarily for drones and smaller ships, the Speckle is a deadly albeit relatively unsophisticated weapon."
	description "Due to its limited range, the Speckle shines when a ship can sneak close enough to an enemy to bring it to bear, where it can begin tearing through armor and hull. However, its effectiveness is much more limited against shields, which shrug off its mass driver rounds with relative ease."

	description "Of course, the inherently limited range and velocity of kinetic weapons makes the Speckle Turret a poor match for some of the longer-ranged weapons used by the Avgi, but the sheer firepower it can put out can make it deadly to close targets."

	description "A monolithic slab of semiconductor diode is used to efficiently pump a spool of doped optical fiber. Hundreds of kilometers long, the coiled fibers serve as a lasing medium with the power needed to produce an intense beam of light, and can be gain-switched to pulse at a variety of frequencies. The produced laser light, which can be converted to a number of wavelengths, can be easily tapped and routed via optical fibers or mirrors to a number of turrets on a ship, eliminating the need for the heavy lasing generator to be anywhere near the turret itself."
	description "The wavelength of light produced in the coil can altered by swapping the diodes and fiber dopants, allowing the Optical Lasing Generator to support up to three Green Optical Lasers or a single Blue Optical Laser."

Unlike a typical pulsed-shot human antimissile system, this turret's precise optics seems designed to hold a beam on target at an extreme distance for a longer period of time, making it better suited for defending and supporting other ships from afar."
	description "The turret itself only contains the optics needed to synthesize, focus, and target the beam, allowing the laser light to be produced elsewhere. Because of this, an Optical Lasing Generator is needed to run this turret, providing enough power to support three Green Lasers."

	description "This lightweight turret can be fed a beam of light from a lasing generator, which is then combined and focused to produce an intense beam ideal for damaging other ships. By pulsing thousands of times each second, the beam can create thermal and mechanical shocks in the target material, enhancing its ability to drill through armor. Unlike the advanced beam weapons used by some other species, this laser is subject to the effects of diffraction, causing its damage to become less intense with distance while also rendering it invisible. However, precise optics allow the beam to be targeted from an exceptional range, despite the tenuous damage at the edge of the laser's reach."
	description "	The turret itself only contains the optics needed to synthesize, focus, and target the beam, allowing the laser light to be produced elsewhere. Because of this, an Optical Lasing Generator is needed to run this turret, providing enough power to support a single Blue Laser."

Upon closing in on a target, the missile unwraps into dozens of thin tungsten rods to create a cone-shaped area of effect. While only a fraction of the payload actually impacts a target, the cloud of projectiles is difficult to completely eliminate."
