	description "This compact coilgun fires a stream of hypervelocity projectiles, accelerating them on a traveling wave of magnetic energy as capacitors are discharged through a series of coils. Designed primarily for drones and smaller ships, the Speckle is a deadly albeit relatively unsophisticated weapon."
	description "	Due to its limited range, the Speckle shines when a ship can sneak close enough to an enemy to bring it to bear, where it can begin tearing through armor and hull. However, its effectiveness is much more limited against shields, which shrug off its mass driver rounds with relative ease."

	description "A monolithic slab of semiconductor diode is used to efficiently pump a spool of doped optical fiber. Hundreds of kilometers long, the coiled fibers serve as a lasing medium with the power needed to produce an intense beam of light, and can be gain-switched to pulse at a variety of frequencies. The produced laser light, which can be converted to a number of wavelengths, can be easily tapped and routed via optical fibers or mirrors to a number of turrets on a ship, eliminating the need for the heavy lasing generator to be anywhere near the turret itself."
	description "	The wavelength of light produced in the coil can altered by swapping the diodes and fiber dopants, allowing the Optical Lasing Generator to support up to three Green Optical Lasers or a single Blue Optical Laser."

Unlike a typical pulsed-shot human antimissile system, this turret's precise optics seems designed to hold a beam on target at an extreme distance for a longer period of time, making it better suited for defending and supporting other ships from afar."
	description "	The turret itself only contains the optics needed to synthesize, focus, and target the beam, allowing the laser light to be produced elsewhere. Because of this, an Optical Lasing Generator is needed to run this turret, providing enough power to support three Green Lasers."

	description "This lightweight turret can be fed a beam of light from a lasing generator, which is then combined and focused to produce an intense beam ideal for damaging other ships. By pulsing thousands of times each second, the beam can create thermal and mechanical shocks in the target material, enhancing its ability to drill through armor. Unlike the advanced beam weapons used by some other species, this laser is subject to the effects of diffraction, causing its damage to become less intense with distance while also rendering it invisible. However, precise optics allow the beam to be targeted from an exceptional range, despite the tenuous damage at the edge of the laser's reach."

	description "Unlike humanity, the Avgi do not have a strong taboo against the use of nuclear weapons in space. To them, nuclear weapons are simply another tool, albeit one with a particularly high energy density, to be used when the occasion calls for it. They have been the Avgi's trump card against the Aberrant, the one weapon they have capable of reliably breaking their advanced shields and atomizing their armor."
	description "	This particular missile carries a powerful thermonuclear warhead, a staged device with a far higher yield to weight ratio than anything humanity has developed. It seems to be the product of centuries of development of nuclear devices, as opposed to humanity's long abstention from nuclear weapons research."
	description "	The Orchid Missile is ammunition for the External Launch Tube; without a External Launch Tube to store them in you cannot purchase or use Orchid Missiles."

	description "The Ophrys is a minimally-guided nuclear torpedo derived from the Orchid Nuclear Missile. Little more than the Orchid's terminal stage with a layer of ablative armor added to the front, it allows even small drones to pose a credible threat to a capital warship."
	description "	Unlike the nuclear missiles employed by the Avgi, the Ophrys carries only enough propellant to make small adjustments to its trajectory. It instead relies on the speed of the bomber carrying it, trading an independent propulsive capability for enough armor to improve the odds of surviving antimissile fire during its terminal path."
	description "	The Ophrys Torpedo is ammunition for the External Launch Rail; without an External Launch Rail or Ophrys Stockpile to store them in you cannot purchase or use Ophrys Torpedoes."
