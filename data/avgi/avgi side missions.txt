			`As you explore the spaceport of <origin>, you come across a small grassy park, the greenspace a welcome contrast to the otherwise mechanical facilities. As the centerpiece of the park, where you'd expect a fountain or a statue in a human park, is a curious hanging windchime, made of pieces of colorful glass and various metals. It's more than a little mesmerizing, and you stop to listen as it rustles in the gentle circulation of the station's air.`
			`	"Is this one of the humans I have heard so much about, question?" The translator tucked behind your ear suddenly speaks, responding to an Avgi voice. You turn and see an Avgi perched on a park bench behind you, his purple coloring faded with age. A board of colorful stones sits on the table in front of him, a game of some kind. He gives you an odd sort of salute with a forelimb, probably an Avgi greeting of some kind.`
			choice
				`	"Hello there."`
				`	"Hi, I'm Captain <first> <last>."`
					goto name
			`	"Courteous introduction. I am called Wisteria. Would you grace me with your own name?"`

			label name
			`	"Appreciated meeting. A pleasure to meet you, Captain <last>. Would you like to join old Wisteria at a game of Trefoil, question? I would be happy to teach you how to play, of course."`
			choice
				`	"Sure."`
				`	"No thank you."`
					defer
			`	"Delight. The youth these days have little appreciation for the art of Trefoil, you know." He taps one eye knowingly, an odd gesture. "Or at least my mother would say. That was sixty years ago, hmm. Please, sit, sit!" He points to the other side of his bench, with nothing more than a horizontal rail for a seat.`
			choice
				`	"That sure looks comfortable."`
				`	"I'll stand, I think."`
			`	"Amusement. The other humans had chairs made to suit your forms, they did. Folded them up and carried them everywhere."`
			`	"Did you meet them?" you ask.`
			`	"Yes, yes. Several times. Only the angry one was any good at Trefoil, sadly. Speaking of which-" He deftly rearranges the colored stones, arranging them into a neat pattern: three triangles, one of each color, angled with their topmost points touching at the center of a six-sided board.`

			scene "scene/trefoil"

			`	"Respectful deference. Which color would you like to play as, question? There is no real difference between them, as far as the game plays."`
			choice
				`	"Red."`
				`	"Green."`
				`	"Blue."`
			`	"Acknowledgment. Excellent. Explanation. The objective is to remove all of your pieces from the board by moving them to the opposite edge to your own triangle." Demonstrating with a stone, he shows you how to skip it over connected chains of other pieces, moving to their endpoint. "You must balance your moves between freeing your own pieces and blocking the other colors from their own escape."`
			`	You delicately take a seat on the rail. It's at least only a little worse than a park bench, and you're thankful for the lower gravity on Peripheria.`
			choice
				`	"But there's three sides and only two of us."`
			`	"Approving. An astute observation. The third color can be played by a third person, in some variations, but in our case we take turns moving for it. It - the Third - is an external actor, under our influence yet outside our absolute control, often used as a pawn to block the other player's moves when opportune. Now, would you like to make the first move, question? Players generally either focus on either evacuating their own pieces or moving to block their opponent's path to escape."`

			`	Slightly adjusting his position on the bench, the Avgi continues. "Now, after each of our turns, we shall move one of the Third's pieces. You should focus on moving them to your advantage, whether that be by blocking my pieces or keeping them out of the way of your own."`

For without the long millennia to sharpen the spear of war, how much worse would we have fared against the Aberrant, question? And yet my old bones grow weary with every failed expedition to reclaim Aviskir, and I hear the voices crying out that enough is enough, and to give up on our old worlds and build a new life out here."`
				goto next3

			label hardlife
			`	"Agreement. Yes, we do, and it grows harder the longer our war with the Aberrant goes on. We build our defenses up and they knock them down, we send armadas to retake Aviskir and they are routed or never return. It seems that all of our energies must go into this war, and little of our wealth is spent elsewhere. It is little wonder that some say we should seek to truly build a new life here, rather than waste our lives and efforts on reclaiming the old."`
				goto next3

			label safe
			`	"Amusement. Fair to say, as I suppose the perspective of an outsider must be more confused than enlightened, when confronted with a new species, a new civilization, for the first time. And I suppose you have seen little of our true civilization, the planets we left to the Aberrant."`

			label next3
			`	"Regardless, I wonder what you would think of us, had you arrived before the Aberrant threw us from our homes. Conflict. It is almost a shame to me that you have to see us in our current state, but then I think of the unity and selflessness that we have found in each other, and that fills me with pride."`

			`	Wisteria quickly completes his own move, as well as his movement of the Third. Now he seems to be moving a piece in your direction, perhaps to block you. After a few more back-and-forth moves between the two of you, he asks you another question.`
			`	"So, Captain <last>. I am curious. If you found yourself in our place, an invincible enemy placed between yourself, armed with the last dredges of your people's spacefaring strength, and the bulk of your people, held hostage on their very planets but otherwise unharmed, what would you do, question? Would you abandon them to their fate to build a new life out amongst the stars, or gamble your remaining strength on a bet to liberate them?"`
			choice
				`	"You can't just abandon everyone on your planets. Surely there's a way to win against the Aberrant, even if it takes sacrifice."`
					goto liberate
				`	"If the Aberrant aren't attacking the surfaces of the Avgi worlds, maybe you should focus on making life better out here first. After all, you have people out here to take care of too."`
					goto abandon
				`	"I would find another way. Communicating with the Aberrant maybe, or finding a way to both fight the war and help the people out here."`
					goto anotherway

			label liberate
			`	"Appreciation. Such is the opinion of most of us, those who feel lucky to have escaped in the first place and feel a certain obligation to help the rest of our people. But the way forward is unclear. If we build our strength, our military might, perhaps we will have a chance in the future to truly drive the Aberrant from our homes, but just how far we can drive the free Avgi of the Consonance, I do not know. Perhaps it will break us, and leave us with no victory at all."`
				goto next5

			label abandon
			`	"Contemplation. That view would have been anathema to us only a short few years ago, but it is one that is steadily gaining ground. With each defeat and failed expedition back to the Twilight, the calls grow to focus on preserving what we have, not reaching to reclaim the old. And many say that those on the old worlds are safe, for now, and may even be able to build a fleet to liberate themselves, if they can but reclaim their orbital shipyards and asteroid mines. If that truly is the case, they say, then we should build ourselves up as a bastion first, with the living space and abundance to support our population."`

			label anotherway
			`	"Amusement. Always in search of another way, everyone is. Perhaps because the choice we are left with is so abhorrent, that seeking another way provides a means of relieving them of it. We have attempted communication with the Aberrant, to no avail, and it seems likely they are not an intelligent species to begin with. They do not appear to coordinate with each other, and examining their debris in the rare instances we have managed to destroy one reveals no crew, just a strange mixture of machine and flesh. Perhaps they are some forgotten living weapon, engineered by a race long gone, or the mere servants of some ancient race far beyond us in power, the equivalents of our mining drones and service robots."`
			`	He splays his arms. "But no, a choice must be made in the end, even if it is only one of degree. Even should we attempt to both build new homes in the Outer Limits and protract our conflict with the Aberrant, the resources allocated to each still remain to be divided up. And there, the conflict between the Consonance and Dissonance lies."`

			label next5
			`	You play a few more rounds with Wisteria, and he shows you how to set up chains of pieces that can be used to skip ahead, while also denying their use to the enemy. After a particularly interesting set of moves, where he demonstrates how to break a chain and add your own endpoints to it, the conversation once more turns to politics.`
			`	"Curiosity. I am reminded, Captain <last>, that you likely do not know much of our system of government in the first place. Am I right in this, question?"`
			choice
				`	"I think I know a little."`
				`	"Yeah, I don't know much aside from there being an Assembly that you vote in."`
					goto assembly

			`	"Consideration. I see. It is something that should be rectified, then, to make your time among us less confusing. The first thing that you should know is that the Avgi are not, nor have ever been, united under a single government."`

			label assembly
			action
				log "Factions" "Avgi" `There are thousands of Avgi governments called polities, which seem to resemble city-states or ideological identities more than true nations. Many, if not most, have banded together into the Consonance, where Electors with varying political weight based on the population of their respective polities make consensus decisions for the species as a whole.`

			`	"Explanation. The Assembly of Polities, as it is formally named, is a rather complicated institution. As its name suggests, it is, well, an assembly of polities. Polities being... associations, or identities. I have read of your human histories, and you could perhaps consider them an analog of nations, but with two key differences."`
			`	Wisteria raises a sharp finger. "One, they are not geographically bounded. Oh, many will perhaps have ownership over various pieces of land and space stations, but that is in constant flux, and they are rarely joined into a contiguous whole. And two, an individual Avgi can belong to any number of polities at the same time. Citizenship, you may think of it, is shared - and diluted - between as many polities as an Avgi wishes to belong to. Religion, ethnic heritage, economic sector, and even common interests are the most common lines by which polities might base themselves around, but there is one for almost any group imaginable. Even major corporations, or industries that have banded together."`
			`	He spreads his arms out as if presenting a great circle. "The Assembly was an attempt at securing harmony between these polities, to prevent conflicts, and when that became impossible, to set the rules and limits of war. One representative, an Elector, per polity, with a vote weighted by the number of Avgi belonging to it, and by how those Avgi had chosen to dilute their own membership among the various polities. And from they select three Speakers, a Trirumvirate to lead the leaders."`
			choice
				`	"Do the Avgi in a polity elect their Elector?"`
				`	"Corporations are part of the government? I've seen that one before."`
					goto syndicate
			action
				log "Factions" "Avgi Consonance" `While most of the Electors the various Avgi polities select to represent them in the Consonance are elected democratically, others are not, with their own systems of appointment. The Consonance is thus perhaps an example of a republic that is not fully democratic.`

			`	He shrugs, an oddly human gesture. "It depends. Many polities do not even elect their own leadership, and they are free to select their representative however they wish. For some it is an elected position, for others it is one appointed by their leadership. A few even have their head of government serve as their Elector, though that is quite the time commitment to make."`
			`	Wisteria looks up. "But yes, most of the polities use some form of democracy. An Avgi might find themselves voting in several elections, one for each polity they claim membership to, with their vote diluted by how many polities they belong to."`
				goto nextassembly

			label syndicate
			`	Wisteria thrums in laughter. "Amusement. Yes, I've heard of your Syndicate. It was strange to me, to hear of a corporation that wished for the burden of true governance, instead of leaving that to your Republic. It seems to me that the industrial polities here try their best to avoid any responsibility, while still reaping the benefits of representation."`

			label nextassembly
			`	"Amusement. And of course there are internal factions within the Assembly, as likeminded polities work together to advance their agendas, then just as quickly abandon each other. A harsh world, the Assembly is."`

			choice
				`	"What factions are there in the Assembly?"`
					goto factions
				`	"They're all that ruthless, even now?"`
			`	Wisteria laughs. "Of course they are. Oh, most of them have the same goal in the end, defeating the Aberrant, but there are many who are convinced that their methods are best suited for achieving that goal."`

			label factions
			action
				log "Factions" "Avgi Consonance" `There are many factions in the Consonance Assembly that compete for power and influence.`
				log "Factions" "Avgi Consonance" `The Centralists wish to see the Consonance evolve into a true central government with real power. Mostly popular among smaller polities that would otherwise lack influence, their critics accuse them of authoritarianism while they argue strong leadership is needed to combat the Aberrant.`
				log "Factions" "Avgi Consonance" `The Technocrats are a group of corporate and industrial polities that believe in the power of technology to defeat the Aberrant. Besides a shared interest in funding research and development projects, they often conflict with each other, and the results of their sponsorships have been mixed.`
				log "Factions" "Avgi Consonance" `The Financiers are influenced primarily by old money, those families and polities who control the largest trade unions and banking organizations. Their financial power makes them almost universally unpopular to the people, but they work behind the scenes to promote unity and effective governance by taking advantage of their influence.`
				log "Factions" "Avgi Consonance" `The Nationalists are a diverse group that rail against the Consonance's subversion of individual polities. They especially resent the consolidation of individual national navies into the Twilight Guard, but are considered a reliable force against perceived overreach.`
				log "Factions" "Avgi Consonance" `The Ecologists are a single issue faction that simply desires the settlement of Weledos. Many have sympathies to the increasingly popular position that the Avgi should focus on settling the Tangled Shroud instead of trying to reclaim Aviskir.`
				log "Factions" "Avgi Consonance" `The Freelancers have little in common besides a disdain for the taxes and financial controls imposed by the Assembly. Many with Dissonance sympathies can be found among them, but just as many are loyal Consonance supporters who merely desire lower taxes.`

			`	He ticks them off on his pointed fingers, three on each hand. "There are the Centralists, those from the smaller polities who wish to see the Consonance grow in authority and power. The war against the Aberrant demands strong leaders, they say, and many agree with them." He tilts his head to the left.`
			`	"The Technocrats, they disdain that, and place their hopes in a qualitative solution to defeat the Aberrant. Build better ships and give them better weapons, and the Aberrant can be swept from the Twilight without the need to demand ever more resources from our people. They draw from many of the industrialist polities, but their loyalties are often divided," he says as he makes a move.`
			`	"The Financiers, the old money types with their fingers in everything, they represented many of the more urbanized regions of the core worlds, and their influence has come with them. Disdained by everyone in public, and beloved by all who would seek to benefit from their influence, I would credit them for being half the reason for the present unity between polities that would normally refuse to cooperate with each other," he says with an amused flick of his wings.`
			`	"There are more, of course, with lesser influence. The Nationalists, who resent the decline of their polities' power, and especially the subsumption of their militaries into the Twilight Guard, are an ever-present thorn in the side of the Centralists, but they at least are quick to point out authoritarianism when they see it. The Ecologists want but a single thing, the complete settlement of Weledos, and the refocusing of resources on colonization and construction rather than shipbuilding. And there is a loose coalition, the Freelancers, who agree on nothing except that taxes and price controls should be relaxed."`
			`	He sits back. "And of course the Twilight Guard is its own faction, as much as they will emphasize their neutrality. They have their supporters and detractors, but none can oppose them entirely, for they are all that stands between us and the Aberrant."`
			`	With that, he deftly moves a Third piece, trapping a cluster of your stones behind a wall.`

					goto dissonance

			`	"Contemplation. Perhaps a better question would be, 'what it was like before the hyperdrive?' For our society was not placed into turmoil first by the Aberrant, but rather by the discovery of a means to travel faster than light. Inside a handful of years an outlandish physics experiment went from theory to reality, and stars that had been decades or centuries away instead became reachable in first months, then weeks, then days as the hyperdrive continued to improve."`
			`	He leans in. "You must understand, emphasis, just how economically separated the various pockets of Avgi civilization were. Aviskir of course was dominant within the Anax system, but beyond interplanetary politics practically every system was independent in both a political and economic sense. There was no Consonance to organize the various powers, and everyone largely kept to themselves by sheer virtue of the distance and expense involved in interstellar travel."`
			`	Wisteria spreads his arms as if to encompass the entire station. "Then, almost overnight, the situation went from one of extreme separation to one of interconnection. The fleets of vast starships, powered by stores of antimatter or immense lasers, became obsolete, and it suddenly became possible for even moderately well-off individuals to travel between the stars."`

We colonized an additional trio of systems, and explored dozens more."`
				goto consonance

			label war
			`	"Remembrance. Some, yes, though not as many as you might expect of us. A few powers on Aviskir tried to seize weaker colonies once they gained access to hyperdrives, but they overestimated their ability to wage war between the stars. It was years before the first truly capable interstellar warships were built, and by then the situation had stabilized enough that there were few polities interested in starting a new war."`
				goto consonance

			`	"Caution. Ah. Our wayward cousins. As much as some fearmongers would have you believe, the Dissonance is neither a rival government nor a subversive movement. Rather, they are a collection of those dissatisfied with the Consonance and the Assembly. Their reasons and motivations vary, but their most significant common grievance is the control over prices enforced by the Consonance as they appropriate resources for use by the Twilight Guard. That, and the taxes the Assembly attempts to levy without much success, has turned many against the Consonance, and those polities who fly Dissonance colors reject any allegiance to the Consonance."`

					goto guard
				`	"That seems too simple. That can't be their only reason for leaving the Consonance, not in an existential war."`

			`	"Approving. That is an astute observation, and one you are correct in. It is of course more complicated than a simple disdain for taxation and price controls. There is the matter of sovereignty, the continued decline of the power of the polities as the Consonance takes on additional responsibilities. Many of the polities that created the Consonance no longer exist, and even more are nothing more than a collection of refugees, the bulk of which sleep in cryogenic storage, waiting for us to build the habitable space needed to awaken them. Many resent this, remembering the days of freedom and true independence, and the rejection of Consonance authority is one way to revisit those days."`
			`	He turns his head to the side. "Sadness. I cannot say I blame them. They are correct in that the Assembly does grow ever more overbearing, and the fear of more polities leaving the Consonance has served as a check on the tendency for the Assembly to grant itself ever more powers."`

Many of them would argue that we may simply hide within the Tangled Shroud, or instead dedicate our efforts to fortifying a single system at their entrance.

There was remote communication, of course, with bright x-ray lasers and telescopes to receive them, but the transfer rates were too slow for information to be shared in bulk."`

			`	She looks a little happier at your question. "Explanation. Quickly and decisively. High intensity battles, to knock out the enemy as quickly as possible while expending as few resources as possible. You spend days, maybe even weeks, just watching to try and pin down your enemy, and then you launch everything you have. Missiles loosed from extreme range, and then long ranged beams to defend yourself as you close with the enemy fleet. Each ship would have a dedicated role, designed to support each other and the overall fleet with specific capabilities while countering those same capabilities held by the enemy."`

			label aberrant
			`	Claret seems to deflate. "Embarrassment. Yes. Well. That wasn't the core of the problem we had against the Aberrant, I think. The admirals will tell you it was because we weren't united enough, that there was too much disagreement between the fleets sent to stop them, or that the Aberrant simply had stronger ships, but the truth is that our fleets were designed to fight other Avgi, not an unknown race of aliens that simply didn't fit into our doctrine. We built them to fight ourselves so well they weren't equipped to fight someone who didn't play by our rules."`
			choice
				`	"What happened in those first battles?"`
				`	"So how has your doctrine changed since then?"`
					goto changes

			`	"We used to have years to look into the capabilities of our likely opponents, and try and figure out what they could do and how well they could do it. We had missiles designed to track enemy torches, and ships filled with enough of them to kill half a dozen peers before needing resupply. And that worked, because it wasn't like a giant fleet of nigh-invincible enemies was going to appear out of nowhere, right?"`
			`	She clicks her fingers. "Despair. All of that failed against the Aberrant. We weren't well equipped to track them at range, with how dim their engines are compared to us, and letting them get close was a death sentence for ships that mostly carried long range nuclear missiles. The first encounters with them were one-sided slaughters, until engineers slapped bigger radar arrays on our ships to try and spot the Aberrant before they could tear through us."`
			choice
				`	"Did that work?"`

			`	"That stopped the bloodletting, for a while. Apprehension. Until the front lines began to run low on missiles. When it takes a ship's entire magazine to kill an Aberrant before it has to retreat and resupply, it simply isn't sustainable. And the particle beams wielded by some of our ships, the ones that could fight at long range, were simply absorbed by the Aberrant's shields, something we're still trying to overcome. But for a while it seemed like nothing was working."`

			label changes
			`	"Praise. We had to completely throw out everything we thought we knew and start over. We ended up bringing back coilguns and kinetic kill vehicles - ridiculously short range weapons compared to a serious beam or missile. But it's what we could field at short notice, and build in the numbers needed to at least hold the Aberrant at bay. What we fly these days would probably be slaughtered by a pre-Incursion fleet, but the Aberrant fight at a much shorter range anyway, and our modern fleets have much better endurance when it comes to ammunition."`
			`	Claret thrums with laughter. "If you had told a planner that we'd be fighting with coilguns and kinetic kill vehicles, before the Incursion you'd have been laughed out of the room. But we're lucky that the Aberrant's weapons are short ranged, such that we can actually hit them at the range of a dumb projectile from a coilgun without being instantly swatted out of the sky."`

			choice
				`	"Don't the Aberrant still have superior technology?"`
					goto technology
				`	"And now you're able to hold your own against them?"`

			`	"Discomfort. Maybe at first, when we could count on having a numerical advantage, but the Aberrant continue to reproduce at a faster rate than we can build ships. And these new weapons, well, they were considered obsolete for a reason. We need something that can dish out more damage, and at a longer range, without being as expensive and resource-intensive as a missile."`
				goto shields

			label technology
				`	"Oh, yes, appreciation. But they don't use it to its full extent, probably because they aren't intelligent beings in their own right. They just make more of each other, without any changes other than occasional mistakes. And their weapons don't seem like they were meant to be weapons, if that makes sense. More of a cutting beam than a true weaponized laser."`

			label shields
			`	"That's why things really were desperate, until you humans came around. That changed everything, knowing there was a non-hostile, if not outright friendly, alien power nearby. Even though it sounds like your government isn't able to help directly, given the lack of connecting starways, technological support from a more advanced species could be enough for us to win. Shields, shared by your people, were already a game changer by themselves."`

					goto help

Rather, we used it essentially as a giant x-ray source to drive a dozen other experiments. That's pretty common in nuclear testing, actually, since experiments that could benefit from a nuke are far more common than new designs that need to be tested. Most of the experiments we ran today were nuclear-driven accelerator tests, using the energy of the explosion to drive a particle beam.
