The spectators in the arena erupt with a flurry of wing flapping in what seems to be a loud cheer; your translator picks up "Excitement" and "Anticipation", among other moods, dozens of times. The fencers' wings appear to be kitted out with thin copper wires, and they're carrying the same rapiers you saw them with before. They hop up onto small pedestals located on each edge of the arena.`

The two spiral upwards into the far upper areas of the arena, and quickly drop back down, darting in and out of each others' reach multiple times per second. Less than a minute later, you hear a loud ding, and one of the duelists falls to the floor with their wing collapsed. The crowd, who hadn't stopped buzzing the entire duel, erupts with even louder wing fluttering.`
