	landscape land/station25
	description `Once one of many, this was an enormous synchrotron particle accelerator several kilometers in diameter, dedicated towards the industrial production of large quantities of antimatter. With beamed power provided by the hundreds of solar collection satellites in low orbit around Anax, enough antimatter could be produced each year to supply both Avgi research and industrial efforts.`
	description `Combined, the amat farms around Anax produced several tons of antimatter each year.`

planet Avalet
	attributes "gas giant" "requires: gaslining" uninhabited
	landscape land/clouds_01
	description `Avalet is a hot ice giant, similar in size to Neptune but orbiting far closer to Anax. Tidally locked, one face of the gas plant is heated to incandescence while the other experiences temperatures cold enough to freeze the trace water and ammonia out of its mostly hydrogen atmosphere. This drives a cycle of powerful winds that ring the entire planet, producing immense cyclones capable of even pushing some clouds to the edge of space.`
	description `The erosion of the solar wind against Avalet produces a bright cometary tail visible from Aviskir, and in multiple Avgi mythologies the planet occupied a role of preeminence: a messenger, or a king, or even a creator. In more modern times, the antimatter trapped in Avalet's magnetic field fueled Avgi starships until Antivili Station was built.`

planet Omanet
	attributes avgi mining uninhabited
	landscape land/mars0
	description `Omanet is thought to be a chthonian world, a former gas giant whose atmosphere was stripped away until the rocky core was left bare. For whatever reason, Omanet went a step further, and its silicate crust and mantle were also boiled off, leaving behind an extraordinarily dense world made almost entirely out of metal, ultimately captured around another gas giant, Avalet, as an unusually large moon.`
	description `Despite its unfavorable position deep in Anax's gravity well, Omanet was heavily industrialized, with autofabs building enormous discs of nickel-iron anodized with silver. These orbital mirrors are then launched via mass driver, collecting sunlight for uses from industrial asteroid smelting to remote beamed power. Avgi futurists saw this as the first step towards a swarm that would eventually cover the entire star, but at the current rate of mirror assembly it will take millennia to exploit a meaningful fraction of Anax's output.`

planet Melatos
	attributes avgi uninhabited
	landscape land/snow36
	description `Despite being a large rocky world, Melatos lacks all but the thinnest of atmospheres. Avgi astrogeologists have determined that some cataclysmic event only a few million years ago melted and quickly refroze the outermost layers of its crust. This rapid cooling created a world with a smooth, marble-like texture, almost like ceramic, which is crazed by deep cracks formed as the crust refroze.`
	description `The remelting of Melatos' crust also means that heavier elements such as metals mostly sank to the core, and are hard to find without subcrustal mining, an unattractive prospect when combined with the planet's relatively deep gravity well. As such, Melatos remains mostly undeveloped, with the settlements on its surface being almost exclusively scientific in purpose.`

	description `Aviskir is a world of sweeping mountains and sparkling oceans. It also happens to be the Avgi homeworld, bustling with nine billion members of the species. Civilization has concentrated largely around bountiful mountain valleys and fjords, many warmed by hot springs and geothermal heat. The largest cities are built around the smaller peaks, laced with slender bridges and bright skyscrapers. They stand in contrast to the rural valley settlements below, which are said to offer simpler, more traditional lives.`
	description `The Incursion has forced the remaining Avgi on the surface to dedicate a large part of their industry towards building defensive missile systems and banks of lasers, all in the hope of turning away the attack runs the Aberrant sometimes make on the surface.`
	spaceport `The largest spaceports once hosted 'beanstalks,' space elevators capable of lifting cargo en masse to geostationary orbit. After the invention of the gravity repulsor, they were largely relegated to historical curiosities, but the Aberrant still severed them during their attack on Aviskir's orbital infrastructure.`

	description `A former planetoid captured into Aviskir's orbit only a few hundred million years ago, Sela is unusual for large moons in that it is not tidally locked, instead having a rapid rotational period of only forty-two hours. Almost one third of the moon is covered in a glassy plain of ice, smoothed by seasonal melting and refreezing. This is thought to have been deposited by a cometary impact relatively recently, and has been steadily sublimating away into space ever since.`
	description `An Avgi first set foot on another world here, carried by a ship driven by nuclear pulsed propulsion. Driving a ship by detonating small nuclear explosives behind a pusher plate would be seen as insanity by most species, but for the Avgi it was their first stepping stone in the colonization of their home system.`

	landscape land/snow38
	description `The Avgi were fortunate to have this nearly habitable planet in their home system. Covered in a thick crust of ice, a deep subsurface ocean lies just below the surface, heated by the radioactive decay of isotopes in its rocky core.`
	description `This planet was the first to be settled by the Avgi, who almost immediately began thickening its atmosphere, oxygenating it, and warming the surface with orbital mirrors. Despite beginning this process nearly three centuries ago, it will likely be another century before Thilos becomes warm enough to live on, though its atmosphere is already breathable.`
	spaceport `The primary spaceport is located near a region where the icy crust is thin. The landing pads are built from enormous slabs of ice, thick enough to absorb the plume of a fusion torch. During the summer, the plumes of cryovolcanoes often surround the spaceport, tinging the tenuous sky with pale blue streaks.`

	description `Because of its shallow gravity well and abundance of volatiles, Entantel is one of the biggest exporters of water ice in the outer Anax system.`

	description `The first crewed interstellar expedition launched by the Avgi entered orbit first around Iconil, rather than the tantalizingly habitable world of Livoula nearby. This seemingly unorthodox decision was made by the ship's crew because of the dwarf planet's combination of low gravity and visible patches of sparkling ice, which offered an easy way to replenish the vessel's propellant. The mission spent several months gathering resources and launching probes before finally crossing the last stretch to settle Livoula: the Avgi's first interstellar colony.`

planet Saeketer

	description `This large ice giant hosts a layer in its upper atmosphere where the pressure and temperature are both close to Aviskir's at sea level. Beyond this, the gravity at this altitude is only slightly stronger than what a typical Avgi is used to, creating a paradoxically habitable area in the skies of a gas planet.`
	description `If Saeketer was in the Anax system, it is likely some enterprising group of Avgi in the pre-hyperdrive era would have colonized its skies in aerostat habitats and floating colonies. The newly available real estate in the form of practically pristine terrestrial worlds has unfortunately devalued opportunities such as this, with there being less of a drive to colonize and exploit every body in a given star system.`

The Avgi pioneers who volunteered for the mission knew well in advance that the system lacked any garden planets, but set out regardless; all of them were well prepared to spend the rest of their lives in orbital stations. Finding a cool, airless moon around a gas giant, the colonists settled down and began constructing habitats and gathering essential resources.`
	description `Unfortunately, Span is prone to violent eruptions, and a coronal mass ejection struck after less than a year. Their precision machining equipment was still located on their orbiting starship, and was severely damaged; without that, the colony slowly succumbed to equipment failure until the last living Avgi recorded a farewell poem that remains famous to this day.`

These largely come from the planet's rings, which are in the last stages of a decaying orbit that deposits them in broad bands across Uryyhr's surface.`

The mountain-born Avgi, however, were rather discomforted by its relatively flat landscape and sluggish winds, and permanent settlement has been sparse.`
	description `The oceans are rich in appetizing sea life, and Stilacrest is home to an abundance of independent fishing boats run by those seeking to build a new life away from the homeworld. The lure of the calm waves and mild weather is said to have attracted a meditative, laid-back sort of personality.`

During a period of widespread scattered settlement, this low-gravity moon's sharp mountains and tall forests became popular with asteroid miners grown weary of cramped spacecraft. When the hyperdrive brought unprecedented immigration from other worlds, conservationists set aside large swathes of the moon as natural preserves, concentrating most residents in a small group of dense cities.`
	description `While somewhat metal-poor itself, by exploiting the asteroids and other bodies in the Span system, Cyreal developed a robust industrial base that allowed it to weather the economic shock that came with the invention of the hyperdrive relatively easily.`

Had it been present in the Anax system, it very likely would have been an attractive target for terraforming, but with the natural beauty of nearby Cyreal free for the taking the Avgi of the Soar system declined to spend their scarce resources on the comparatively barren Palos.`

While unattractive for settlement due to the scarcity of greenery, Amathil is still home to the descendents of those who arrived on the first few sublight starships, back when little was known about the planet besides that it had an oxygenated atmosphere. The unique culture that has since grown here, under a unified planetary government, emphasizes a sense of community and generosity-- or at least that is how the locals like to be perceived by outsiders.`

Continental uplift has made much of the land characterized by mountainous highland, scattered with numerous springs and lakes. Though the air is thin and the soil is rocky, hardy plants and woody trees cling to life, breaking up the landscape of rocky mountains with colorful meadows and bountiful forests.`
	description `Araio garnered a reputation as a frontier world ripe for plucky pioneers, reminiscent of an oft-romanticized era on Aviskir. While rich in gemstones, natural stones have not been competitive with nanofabricated alternatives since long before the planet was settled, and thus the economy on the surface is almost completely dominated by homesteads and small frontier towns.`
	spaceport `Araio's spaceport was small but well run, capable of efficiently moving small volume goods on and off the world. It was however razed from orbit by the Incursors shortly after the fall of Anax, and the few scouts that are able to sneak through the blockade are forced to use a variety of rocky plateaus instead.`

More recently, Orodens is thought to have supported a hydrological cycle for a brief period, creating rich veins of precipitated minerals. However, the high surface gravity made it costly to transport material to orbit, where it could be shipped to other systems. Before the recent invention of the gravity repulsor, rows of mass drivers fired streams of raw material into orbit, where it would be collected by waiting ships.`

	description `After Avgi starships advanced to the point of being able to reliably withstand ion storms, it was trained deeper into the Ember Waste, looking further back in both space and time. It gathered an impressive amount of data before the Incursion forced its abandonment, though fortunately the telescope seems to have been left unscathed.`

planet Anatrefo
	attributes station uninhabited
	landscape land/station49
	description `Anatrefo was discovered mere years after the Avgi discovered the hyperdrive, and was soon considered the most momentous discovery in Avgi history. An intact alien station, albeit one stripped of any advanced technologies, proved once and for all that the Avgi were not alone in the universe. Even more significant was a long, slender megastructure near the station, appearing as though construction on it had barely been started.`
	description `While study of the station's structure was hoped to provide insights into advanced alien technologies, it has so far proven stubbornly difficult to understand or reverse engineer, with some Avgi scientists remarking that even the station's materials appear to intelligently circumvent attempts to probe their internal structure.`

planet Gamla
	attributes antecessor moon uninhabited
	landscape land/desert19
	description `Unlike most fictional portrayals of precursor species, the previous inhabitants of this dry, salty moon did not leave behind any ancient technological ruins or monolithic stone constructs. Instead, the evidence of their past existence is in the form of tapped mineral veins, concentrations of unmistakably artificial radioisotopes, and a wide belt of orbiting debris degraded to little more than lumps of metal and dust.`
	description `Before they were able to penetrate deeper into the Ember Waste, Gamla was the first evidence the Avgi found of the Antecessors, a species thought to have inhabited the eastern part of their space millions of years ago. While the moon contains no surviving examples of Antecessor technology, it engrossed xenoarcheologists for years.`

planet Masada
	attributes antecessor uninhabited
	landscape land/canyon18
	description `Masada is an old world, one that was dying long before humanity was born. Its tectonic activity ended long ago, and the eons of erosion has worn its terrain down to the bedrock. Most of the surface is bone dry, with the only water trapped in a small chain of cold, brackish seas near the equator. Little rain falls outside their drainage basins, but what does is bitter and alkaline. The broken remains of what might have once been cities, worn down to little more than circular arrangements of rubble, hints that there is much history here - but no future.`
	description `In orbit, the Avgi left behind a constellation of satellites to map the surface, but little else. The lack of anything left by the planet's original inhabitants is a reminder of just how old this world is - old enough for even the highest orbits to decay.`

planet Silwan

	landscape land/fog12
	description `Silwan is a wet, misty world shrouded in a permanent blanket of fog, which covers the entire planet year-round. The little light that makes it to the surface reveals a bleak landscape, eroded to a nearly uniform flatness from the eons of constant rains. Only at the equator is the layer of fog burned off by sunlight, feeding humid forests of fern-like trees.`
	description `Even less evidence of the Antecessors has survived here than usual, thanks to the rains, but this world is one of the few in this region to still host a substantial ecosystem, stubbornly clinging to life. Mossy plants and small, lizard-like scavengers are common across the entire planet, while large apex predators thrive deep in the world's oceans.`

planet Ashkelon
	attributes antecessor uninhabited
	landscape land/mountain33
	description `An otherwise mundane rocky world, Ashkelon is littered with thousands of basalt monoliths. Most are cracked, many others reduced to rubble, and a scant few are intact enough for the deep carvings that cover their surface to be read. These glyphs were seemingly designed to be easily translated, which Avgi researchers quickly did. There was much excitement when it was realized that the monoliths contained instructions and advice on various technologies, but this quickly turned to disappointment when a years-long survey revealed that no monolith had information on anything more advanced than the steam engine.`
	description `Whoever left the monoliths here either never documented their more advanced technologies, or someone went to the trouble of destroying the monoliths that contained them.`

Shaped like a solid disc, it is home to almost a million Avgi, made up of both civilians that were able to flee the core worlds during the invasion and those who already led independent lives in deep space.`
	description `The station contains hundreds of levels, with centripetal gravity on the edges being the strongest. The outer rim is perpetually expanded to create more living space, and will likely continue to grow until the structural limits of the station are reached.`
	description `The station also hosts the Assembly of Consonant Polities, a league of various nations and communities that now serves as the de-facto species-wide government.`
	spaceport `An extensive set of docks and shipyards makes up the innermost portion of the station's disc, and you can see dozens of ships in various states of completion.`
	spaceport `The usual amenities often located on a station of this size fill a dense ring of shops, restaurants, and other services surrounding the spaceport, but many in the Assembly are considering expanding the spaceport outwards at their expense.`

	description `Navigeo is a station designed to be a dedicated shipyard, with dozens of modular dry docks capable of quickly laying down new ships or repairing damaged ones. Overall, almost all of the large warships in service of the Twilight Guard are built here, though efforts are being made to decentralize warship production for the sake of survivability.`
	description `	Due to its importance and nature as a government-operated shipyard, the station is managed by the Twilight Guard directly. An oversight board appointed by the Assembly maintains a level of civilian governance, but given the composition of the station's population, this is clearly a military installation first and foremost.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is closer to being a giant array of dry docks than a true port, with the available amenities confined to the bare essentials. You can easily see a dozen warships under construction, with Avgi workers and robotic arms alike working together to churn ships out every day.`

The work here is largely aimed towards weapons research, a necessary consequence of the fight against the Aberrant.`
	description `	The facilities are surprisingly comfortable for what you might expect from a research station, a deliberate attempt to boost the productivity of the scientists that live and work here. Labs for all sorts of applied energistics, nuclear research, and even hyperspace experimentation form wings around the central habitation core, which is home to tens of thousands of scientists and engineers as well as a sizable support staff.`
	spaceport `Ergastirio's spaceport is small, but well-equipped, with the facilities to handle special nuclear material and fragile scientific instrumentation alike. These constitute most of the goods offloaded here, which the station's laboratories require a steady supply of.`

Aside from a small outpost, which hosts a laboratory exclusively geared towards data collection and analysis, the surface is a barren wasteland of gleaming nitrogen ice and reddish tholins.`
	description `	From orbit, the scars of previous weapons tests are subtle. A grid of craters in an unusually regular pattern, large boulders reduced to heaps of slag, clear lines of bright ice sliced across the reddish surface: the Avgi have left a mark upon this world, where no one exists to complain about it.`

	description `Weledos was colonized even before the Avgi evacuated their orbital assets to the Tangled Shroud. A few brave pioneers were willing to settle within the unpredictable systems of the Shroud to escape the planetary governments of Avgi space. They are said to have surveyed and colonized the planet before most explorers had even reached the entrance to the Shroud, surprising early scouts with their presence.`
	description `	Unfortunately, the Ensemble system is poor in metals and other natural resources, and civilization here had regressed to almost pre-spaceflight levels by the time the Incursion brought a wave of refugees here. The indefensibility of the system coupled with the hostility of the Tangled Shroud forced the Avgi diaspora to settle further beyond Ensemble, despite calls to deposit more civilians here.`

	landscape land/forest15
	description `A rarity in the Tangled Shroud, Aspar is a habitable moon with a temperate climate and a thriving ecosystem. Widespread settlement has been prevented, however, due to the unfortunate fact that life on Aspar uses proteins with the opposite chirality to those used by life on Earth and Aviskir.`

The planet's proximity to its host star, a red dwarf, amplifies the interactions between the solar wind and Viso's magnetic field, producing auroras that often reach the equator.`
	description `Scientific interest aside, the Avgi's interactions with Viso have been limited to harvesting the ammonia for use in fertilizer production, often being interrupted by Aberrant raids.`

The tectonic activity of its moon, large enough to qualify as a binary pair, causes an almost perpetual global earthquake that can be felt by simply standing on the planet.`
	description `The planet's parent stars offer the planet little warmth, and a thin atmosphere of nitrogen and carbon dioxide has managed to hold on to only scattered swathes of ice and snow, with far too little water or heat to support an active hydrological cycle. The anemic erosion, as a result, has done little to smooth the scars left by the influence of the tidal forces that wrack Gestli's surface.`

While it continues to harvest deuterium and helium-3 from the gas giant below, it has largely been supplanted by smaller, less centralized ice-based deuterium refineries. This has led to a degree of neglect by the Assembly, and a posting here is generally regarded as a minor punishment.`

Two dozen kilometers in diameter and three times that in length, when complete it will be able to house tens of millions of Avgi in urban conditions. Thousands of cylinders like these were built over the years in the Avgi core systems, but limited resources have constrained the Avgi in the Tangled Shroud to only building one over the last decade.`
	description `	With resources constantly being reallocated towards new warships and mining installations, many wonder if the cylinder will ever be completed, which would provide enough space to allow the millions of Avgi in cryogenic storage to be revived. The main habitat body is still open to space, and the only area sealed against vacuum is a relatively small section tucked under what will be the habitat's "floor."`

Most of the habitat is freestanding, mounted on the spar that links both asteroids, but one asteroid is also riddled with pressurized tunnels and pockets filled with farms and open green spaces.`
	description `Outpost Enka is a major source of nickel-iron ore, which is common in the system despite the overall metal-poor state of the Tangled Shroud. The station is rumored to be a haven for rebels and dissidents even beyond the usual Dissonance supporters.`
