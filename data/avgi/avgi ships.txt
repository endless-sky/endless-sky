	description "The Koryfi is a light passenger transport whose basic design predates the invention of the hyperdrive. Originally restricted to intrasystem travel, its spin gravity system ensured a comfortable voyage for passengers long before the development of gravity plating. Today, it is a popular choice among independent captains for its high maintainability and ample living space, with many using them as permanent homes."
	description "Enterprising captains often exploit the commonality of the Koryfi and Avlaki designs, swapping out the modular centrifuge for a set of standard cargo containers."
	description "While its standard set of magnetoplasmadynamic thrusters give it an acceleration generously described as sluggish, the Koryfi's constant thrust flight profile allows it to reach an impressive cruising velocity given enough time."

	description "The Melodikos is a large passenger transport built around a similar propulsion and structural frame as the Koryfi and Avlaki, but with a vastly enlarged solar array, as well as a spacious centrifuge habitat. Once used as an interplanetary cycler, it is now used for mass transit between the stars."
	description "While not as modular as the Koryfi and Avlaki designs, the Melodikos shares the same solar array and structural frame as the Harmonikos. Refits to swap the centrifuge for a set of cargo pods are uncommon due to the work involved, but still possible."
	description "While its standard set of magnetoplasmadynamic thrusters give it an acceleration generously described as sluggish, the Melodikos' constant thrust flight profile allows it to reach an impressive cruising velocity given enough time."

	description "The Harmonikos is a large freighter built around a similar propulsion and structural frame as the Koryfi and Avlaki, but with a vastly enlarged solar array, as well as a huge assembly of cargo modules towed behind the main truss. Once used as an interplanetary bulk freighter, it is now used for shipping cargo between the stars."
	description "While not as modular as the Koryfi and Avlaki designs, the Harmonikos shares the same solar array and structural frame as the Melodikos. Its generous caro space is occasionally seen filled with equipment and bunks to create an ad-hoc passenger transport, albeit one lacking the artificial gravity of the Melodikos."

	description "This retrofit of a decommissioned Photikon is little more than a set of cargo pods joined to the front of the former torpedo bomber, with container mounts taking the place of the hardpoints and pylons usually used to mount weapons. An expanded internal tank to fuel a hyperdrive has been barely crammed into the ship, at the expense of other internal systems and armor. Because of this, the Phononos is quite vulnerable to Dissonance piracy or even Aberrant incursions, and is thus always found as part of a larger fleet convoy. Even still, as an automated freighter it experiences much higher accident and loss rates in deep space, a fact that has kept crewed vessels like the Avlaki competitive."
	description "The Phononos can carry an impressive amount of cargo with the same standardized containers used by the Avlaki and Harmonikos, which can be quickly swapped out at the destination for a set of empty ones without needing to unload them."

	description "The Frequentia-class Freighter is most commonly found serving as a fuel tender for ships in larger fleets, taking advantage of its large and ungainly cargo receptacle to store enough cryogenic deuterium to satisfy a small fleet's needs during long journeys. While its spherical fuel tank can be drained and used to transport dry goods and cargo, the cargo bay's notoriously small access door makes loading anything that can't be moved with a pump an exquisitely painful process."

	description "The Polari-class Scout is a legacy design that has managed to remain relevant in the current era by virtue of fulfilling a role historically not requiring much in the way of combat power. A specialized science ship, it is fitted with a spacious laboratory for analyzing samples and processing data, as well as an extensive suite of sensor arrays for recording observations. A pair of bays can deploy Optikon sensor drones, while an external mount is designed to hold an Akoustiki Excursion Vehicle for piloted sample gathering operations."
	description "Despite this versatility, the contested battlespace of the post-Incursion Avgi cluster is one in which the Polari is simply not as capable in. As science crews are increasingly asked to lead risky scouting expeditions back to the Avgi homeworld, demands for a newer, more survivable science ship routinely make their way to the Twilight Guard."

	description "The Entasi is a mid-sized mining vessel, immediately recognizable by its pair of huge solar thermal generators. With the power and weapons capacity needed to support laser mining weapons, the Entasi is able to quickly and efficiently cut through asteroids, whose mineral contents can then be collected by the swarm of Sonikis cargo drones it can carry into an asteroid field."
	description "While somewhat fragile, the energy and space available to the Entasi can make it a potent warship with the right modifications. Rumors abound that certain Entasi captains sympathetic to the Dissonance movement maintain a stockpile of weapons for this very eventuality."

	description "The Undsyni-class Auxiliary Freighter is not a flimsy bulk freighter, but rather one built to be large and strong enough to hold its own against attacks from smaller, more militarized vessels. While not quite as payload efficient as more spindly ships such as the Avlaki and Harmonikos, the Undsyni's resilience makes it much more survivable against attacks, with its fusion torch giving it the acceleration to both evade enemies and minimize travel times."
	description "Even before the Incursion, the Undsyni's strong hull and internal outfit capacity made it a popular option as a capital ship for renegade groups who could not gain access to specialized warships."
	description "A reinforced spine running the length of the ship allows it to fit a huge Plasmadyne Scoop, capable of bearing the extreme stresses the plasma magnet's field inflicts on its superconducting magnets. In this configuration, a tanker Undsyni can supply the fuel needs of an entire fleetgroup across dozens of systems."

	description "This was once an Avgi sublight starship, one of the last models built before the discovery of the hyperdrive. Most starships around this period used ram-augmented fusion drives to reach cruising speeds of up to 0.25c, but the Tachytia class was designed to reach a velocity of 0.4c with an antimatter fuel source to ignite propellant gathered with its huge ramscoop."
	description "This particular ship was never launched on its mission, commissioned just before the hyperdrive made it obsolete. Now, it has been extensively modified by removing many of its propellant tanks, replacing them with a hyperdrive, additional equipment spaces, and several docking bays. The cryosleep bay has also been substituted for spacious habitatation cylinders, making this a true city ship."

	description "The Tremoros-class Interceptor is a small autonomous ship designed to support patrol and interdiction missions. With an emphasis on raw acceleration, it can rocket past any adversary even as it brings its guns to bear, making it exceedingly difficult to hit."
	description "The Tremoros has also seen use as an escort for smaller merchant convoys, with the ability to intercept any enemies that might pose a threat before they can come within range of vulnerable civilian ships."

	description "The Interferos-class Frigate is an autonomous support ship, designed to be easy to build and disposable enough for mass production. To free up frontline warships from having to escort merchant convoys in the Tangles, the Consonance commissioned this design with the intent of licensing its sale to independent merchant captains. It has since become popular due to its impressively large armament, though its attrition rates leave something to be desired."

	description "The Diaspersi-class Escort Carrier is a light carrier capable of providing carrier operations support to smaller fleets, while also being capable of independent strike missions with minimal support. Seen escorting large merchant convoys and small Guard fleets alike, the Diaspersi can support two wings of combat drones as well as a single wing of larger fighters."

	description "The Refraktos-class Laserstar is a relatively recent, post-Diaspora destroyer design with a single focus: directed energy weapons. While its armor and shielding systems are light for its size, its expansive radiators can support the thermal loads of a staggering array of laser weapons, both offensive and defensive, allowing it to destroy both missiles and small ships from a vast distance."
	description "A long truss running the length of the ship is built to fit an impressively large mirror-cell fusion torch, giving the Refraktos the mobility needed to evade opponents until they are reduced to hot vapor."
	description "Due to the anemic damage output of Avgi laser weapons compared to their kinetic weapons and missiles, the Refraktos is most often seen in a support role, providing antimissile coverage to entire fleets."

	description "The Atenuatia is an Avgi fleet carrier, a capital ship that makes up the centerpiece of their battlefleets.

Carrying this arsenal of fighters has its cost, however, and the Atenuatia can carry relatively few heavy weapons for its size."

	description "The Akoustiki Excursion Vehicle is a modern take on the utility pod, a small personal craft designed to aid in the maintenance and repair of a station, or a carrier vessel and its escorts. It is just as commonly seen flitting about the orbitals as it is servicing satellites or acting as a personal transport shuttle between stations and low gravity bodies. Recent advances in magnetoplasmadynamic engines have made it a capable mining craft as well, albeit one with little cargo space for ores."

	description "The Photikon Torpedo Bomber is the cornerstone of Avgi anti-ship carrier doctrine. While it is possible for a swarm of Vibratia and similar interdiction drones to engage capital ships, it is the Photikon that is capable of delivering the nuclear anti-ship munitions necessary to bring down the largest warships. By bringing a nuclear torpedo within close range, the payload has a higher chance of surviving enemy point defense weapons compared with standard missiles."
	description "Photikons are also often used as gun platforms, mounting a Speckle Turret instead of their standard armament of two Ophrys Torpedoes."

	description "The Undulon Orbital Silo was first envisioned as a cheap static defense satellite, little more than a tube capable of storing and launching nuclear-tipped missiles. Over time, this specialization was broadened, and the modern line of Undulons is capable of both mounting a large fixed gun and carrying the energy supply needed to support it. Their mostly hollow construction provides a great deal of internal space for their size, but also makes the drone quite fragile."
	description "Undulons are usually seen defending critical planets and stations, ready to unload their atomic payloads on any hostile ships that jump into the system."

	description "The Optikon Sensor Platform is the latest iteration of a long line of exploration probes developed shortly after the discovery of the hyperdrive. Previously, surveying star systems involved launching thousands of laser-propelled starwisp probes, no larger than a few hundred grams each. The hyperdrive turned this paradigm on its head, allowing the Avgi to build sizable probes designed to quickly map out newly accessible star systems. Over the decades, these gradually shrank as the duty of carrying them between star systems was offloaded onto dedicated exploration vessels, the precursors to the Polari-class Scout. This left the modern Optikon as a highly capable and deployable sensor platform, used in both scientific and combat information roles."
	description "	Drones do not come equipped with a hyperdrive. You cannot carry a drone unless you have a ship in your fleet with a drone bay."

	description "The Sonikis Utility Drone was built as a cheap interorbital cargo drone, originally designed to carry modular cargo containers between stations and small moons. It is now commonly used by large freighters to assist in loading and unloading cargo, as well as to collect ores while asteroid mining."
