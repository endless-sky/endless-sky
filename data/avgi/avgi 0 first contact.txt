This region appears unaffected however, and your computer is able to chart its position.`
			`	The alien ship pings you, indicating to follow as it flies towards what looks to be a large inhabited station in the system. Shaped like a circular disk, a large cutout in the center exposes hundreds of docking bays and what looks to be a spaceport. As you watch, a trio of sleek-looking fightercraft launch from the station and take up escort positions around you and the other alien ship you have followed all this way. You can only assume your escort is in communication with the station authorities.`

A group of them quickly close in around your ship as you finally land in a clear space, moving precisely. These aliens have clearly been expecting you.`
			`	None of the aliens look to be armed, but are arrayed around your ship in a clearly defensive circular pattern, both on foot and flitting about in the air.

			`	The aliens hum and chirp excitedly amongst themselves, the sound reminding you of a string instrument. You notice they seem to produce sounds not from any particular vocal organs, but by rubbing their forearms or legs together akin to a cricket. One of the aliens seems to hush the others, flaring their wings out before returning them to a folded position on their back. They then raise a curved, black instrument reminiscent of a violin bow, drawing it over one of their forelimbs for a moment before the device begins to speak in a synthetic, vaguely masculine voice.`

It's a bit awkward to be corralled by a group of people whose height barely comes past your knees, but you allow yourself to be escorted nonetheless. After exiting through a downward sloping ramp set in the floor, you then follow a long passageway that seems to perpetually curve upwards. You're reminded of older space stations, ones that relied on spin gravity before gravity plating became commonplace.`
			`	Eventually, after a number of turns and descents, you pass through an open archway into some kind of conference room. Large and circular with a high, rounded ceiling, it is occupied by a trio of multicolored dragonfly aliens, each perched on a metal ring running around a circular table.`

We first touched space six centuries ago, and-"`
			`	He is cut off by Prasinos. "Rebuke. You should start from the beginning, long before we left Aviskir. Our ancestors made their homes around the springs in the valleys of the Fel Mountains, and spread across our planet for millennia. From fire to spears to the atom, our skill in turning the natural world to our will grew, and with it our ability to form civilization: groups of Avgi bound together by more than close kinship or geography, instead by ideology and heritage and religion. And with that came conflict, each polity striving with the others to-"`
			`	Now both Asime and Galano make noises of dissent, and Galano, sounding rather hurried, interrupts. "Urgency. Perhaps we are not as united as you, the humans, and it is true that we have fought many wars among ourselves. Emphasis. But that time is long since past. We saw reason, and so the Consonance was created, governed by an Assembly of Polities to represent every division of the Avgi, small or large. From the nation-states to the ideolopoli, a consensus government of our species to resolve disputes, to prevent another Great War. And while there have still been wars fought by the foolish and shortsighted, there has not been a nuclear initiation on Aviskir's surface in more than a century. The Assembly, for all its faults, works."`

They came two decades ago, from the east, beyond the reach of our knowledge, from a perilous region of space we have found difficult to probe. The scouts and explorers on the fringes of known space went dark first, and then the outposts fell one by one."`
			`	Asime continues. "Regret. By the time the Consonance finally took note, the Aberrant swept away the ships Aviskir's polities were able to gather to oppose them. An entire generation of the Twilight Guard, wiped away in a single battle. Their technology is far beyond our own, and at the time it was impossible to oppose them. And the few Aberrations we were able to destroy baffled us. No crew, just a single organic entity inside. And systems operating on principles unknown to us. It can be said that we learned how to make shields from humanity, but we first learned what shields could do from the Aberrant.`
			`	Prasinos says, "Anger. And thus we find ourselves here. When the hopelessness of the military situation became evident, every ship with a hyperdrive was ordered to take on passengers and make its way into the Tangled Shroud - this confusing web of broken starways and shadowed space that we now must call home. We abandoned our planets to the mercy of the Aberrant with little more than their surface defenses, scavenging the orbital infrastructure that had been painstakingly built over the centuries."`
			`	He is interrupted by Asime, who seems annoyed. "Clarification. We were not heartless. The decision to evacuate was only made once it became evident the Aberrant had little interest in orbital bombardment, and that our surface batteries could drive off the ones that did. And we took tens of millions of civilians with us, in cryosleep, to be revived as resources allow."`

Perhaps they can give more details, but they have told us that when they first entered our space, they immediately attempted to leave. For whatever reason, they were unable to. I do not know the means by which you were able to travel to our space, but perhaps you will be able to return, and take these stranded humans with you."`

I will speak to others about a more formal role, but until then I am unsure if we can ask anything of you beyond keeping the peace."`

			`	Galano says, "Interest. I would expect human technology to be superior to our own in most aspects, but we will of course allow you to purchase our items with the agreement of the Assembly. In the event that it becomes possible to open trade relations with your human government, we may find it useful to have prior transactions."`
			`	"Amusement. Not to mention the goodwill such a gesture could buy us," says Asime.`
			`	Prasinos says, more seriously, "Reservation. Our material resources are quite limited at the moment, so for now I would only support providing for the requisition of small items that do not strain the needs of the Guard."`
			`	Asime looks like she wants to object, but then Galano says, "Agreement. A reasonable compromise, one I can sell to the Assembly fairly easily. Beyond that, we will provide you with a line of credit with which to purchase housing and nutrition. I cannot vouch for its usefulness among... certain elements that do not recognize the authority of Consonance, but anywhere else, you should find no issues."`
			`	He twitches his wings. "Satisfaction. For now, we will leave you with some time and space to think. The former captain of the ship that brought the other humans, one Darius Calwell, is currently advising construction on the cylinder habitat in this system. You will find him on Aktina Cylinder, if you wish to speak with him. And should you wish to speak to us as well, there is one last gift we will bestow upon you today that will facilitate that."`
			`	Before you are dismissed, he holds out a long arm, with a black hairpin-shaped rod clutched between his three sharp fingers, like a smaller version of the translator the Avgi have been using to communicate with you. Tucked behind your ear, this device will translate the speech of the most common Avgi languages as is it spoken around you, quietly whispering the meaning into your ear.`

			`	"There has to be a way out, I just know it. But in six years, we've only been able to spend a few days at a time in the systems bordering human space, before those damn space shoggoths forced us back. And," he lowers his voice, looking around surreptitiously, "I don't think the Avgi are that enthusiastic about us trying to map the place either.

After all, they're really enthusiastic about trying for an alliance with humanity to help them against these Aberrant, no matter how many times I explain humans aren't really all that technologically advanced. But they think if I can find a way home, we might be able to find a way to open up a connection between human space and Avgi space, especially given the way we got here. Not that I'd want to do that, with the chance of the Aberrant overrunning human space."`

			choice
				`	"How'd you end up in Avgi space without a jump drive?"`

			label story
			`	"Funny story, that," he says. "We were part of a big convoy from Valhalla, sponsored by one of the major universities there. I was working with Deep Security, after my stint in the Navy... ended." He trails off. "Anyway, we were in a Mule carrying some scanning equipment. To research the Quarg, you see. Officially we were there for cultural outreach and exchange, you know, the usual, but really we wanted some good scans of a Wardragon. The Quarg don't really approve of it, but they don't do much to discourage it either."`
			`	He continues. "So, we were on our way back, just entering Dabih. Really successful trip and everything, with a big bonus waiting for me thanks to how long the trip across the entire Republic took. But then our scanners started picking up weird readings from particular hyperlanes, and we started hearing some pirates chattering about how something weird was happening in the Sadr system. A new hyperlane, pointing south, they said. It was just a few jumps away from our current location, and we were the only Deep ship in the area that could go off alone."`
			`	He looks at his hands. "So I... I made the decision, as captain. I volunteered my crew to investigate it, to travel through that hyperlane in the name of science. For what the Deep holds highest, because I guess I wanted... I don't know. Not the prestige. But to live up to what the Deep's supposed to be, the ones at the forefront of human exploration and research. They took me in when I had nowhere else to go, and I guess I wanted to repay that somehow. And now, now a dozen good men and women are dead, and the rest are stuck here behind a hyperlane that closed the moment we went through it, living among aliens fighting a war of extinction that they probably can't win."`
			choice
				`	"The other members of your crew, where are they now?"`

			`	"There are a few of us left," he sighs, "but, well, I'm not on the best of terms with them. They blame me for bringing them here, and I can't fault them for it."`
			choice
				`	"That seems unfair. There's no way you could have known what would happen."`
					goto blame
				`	"Is there a chance of reconciling with them?"`
			`	"I've made... a lot of mistakes. Ones with a price paid in lives. But," he looks down, "...maybe. They don't hate me or anything like that, we just... keep our distance. Sora's off doing who knows what with the Twilight Guard on Weledos, and Leon is on and off with those mining guilds to the East. There are a few others left too, but like I said. A price paid in lives."`
				goto end

			label blame
				`	"I wish it was that simple. I made more mistakes after that, ones with a price measured in lives. Eleven dead after our ship was disabled, all because I ordered us to get too close to the scary-looking alien ships in the hope we could communicate with them. Sure, you could say I couldn't have known the Aberrant would try to kill us, but I ignored the advice of my crew, just because I was desperate to get home. Sora, Leon, they both told me we should run, but I didn't listen to them."`

			label end
			`	You sit together in silence for a few more minutes, when Darius seems to receive a message on his communicator. "I get patched in to the emergency alert system," he explains as he reads it. Suddenly, he pales. "A scout is reporting a massive invasion headed towards the Ensemble system. Dozens of Aberrations, flying straight through the Shroud." He looks up at you. "They don't normally try to go too deep in the Shroud. Something about it spooks them, I think, but Ensemble is shallow enough that they've attacked it before. Nothing of this scale though, and... damn, Sora's on Weledos, the moon in the Ensemble system."`

No, membership in the Consonance is purely at-will, and many polities have chosen to go it alone even with the current crisis. Regret. The initial evacuation into the Tangled Shroud was haphazard to say the least, as much of it was, and still is, unmapped. Many captains took their ships down differing paths, meeting up with each other and forming alliances just to survive. In a way, it's a miracle that the Consonance was even able to reconstitute itself at all."`

Please do understand, we are not enemies, nor would I say we bear them any ill-will. The Dissonance participates in trade with us and de-facto follows the regulations passed by the Assembly, and each and every one of them wants the Aberrant scoured from our space as much as the rest of us."`

			`Outpost Tekis is a large station built into an asteroid several kilometers across, with networks of tubes and habitats crisscrossing the surface. You pull the <ship> into a cramped hangar dug into the rock and disembark with Hriso, who immediately sets out for a prearranged meeting place. You notice many of the Avgi in the outpost stare at you, Darius, and Sora, likely their first glimpse of a human.`

The local mining guild here says they cannot sustain their operations with the low price on iron mandated by the Consonance, as we are not buying enough rarer metals like titanium to make up for it."`
			`	"That's stupid," says Sora. "Without cheap steel we wouldn't be able to keep expanding Peripheria or build the Aktina Cylinder."`
			`	Hriso doesn't translate that, returning to conversing with the miners. Sora pulls out a translator of her own, listening intently to the conversation, but Darius pulls you aside. "I had a talk with a few people on the way here, and they say there's someone who knows more about the first days after the Incursion. Come on."`
			`	"What did they say?" you ask.`
			`	"Apparently it's someone we have to meet in person," he grumbles. "I don't like it, but I don't think it's anything dangerous. Just inconvenient." You excuse yourself and walk along with Darius.`
			`	Before long, you find yourself in some kind of mess hall, dozens of Avgi sipping from colorful drinks. Darius freezes as he spots a short man seated on a crude stool, the only human-style seating in the room, together with a few Avgi.`

			`	You quickly explain how you found yourself in Avgi space, and Leon nods. "That explains the questions the good Captain was asking," he says, nodding at Darius. "I've spent years collecting this information, from hearing the official narrative to dredging the corners of Avgi space for rumors."`
			`	He leans in. "So, before I tell you this, one condition. I've spent months looking for a way to get a ship to take me to... well, you'll see. But not a lot of captains are willing to take their ships out of the Tangled Shroud and through the Aberrant blockade, so if this leads anywhere, I want a bunk on your ship."`

			`	You open your mouth to reply, but Darius beats you to the punch. "Of course, Leon."`

			`	"Good. Well, it more or less comes down to this: the Incursion didn't come out of nowhere. Everyone says they came from beyond the furthest reaches of Avgi exploration, but that's not quite true. The first to encounter them was a scout ship, which went down within minutes against their weapons. But not before they sent out a single transmission, garbled and not making a lot of sense."`
			`	He pauses, taking a drink of what looks like water. "They said they had found a gateway of sorts, an ancient alien artifact built by an unknown Antecessor species. Somehow, they had activated it, and that's where the first Aberrant came from."`
			choice
				`	"And you want to use this gateway as a way out?"`
				`	"Where do you think this gateway leads?"`

			`	"I don't know where it leads, but it'll be somewhere other than Avgi space. Maybe somewhere your jump drive can work, which would let us eventually make our way back to human space. But it's better than sitting here and twiddling our thumbs for another six years."`
			`	"Where is this gateway?" Darius asks.`
			`	"The Aberrant came from the East, beyond the furthest reaches of the Twilight. A place the Avgi always had trouble exploring, due to strange energy storms periodically ionizing entire systems. But it's apparently recognizable by the red nebula suffusing it, just as the Twilight is surrounded by a cluster of blue nebulae."`
