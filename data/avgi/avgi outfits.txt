This results in a ramscoop that is far more efficient in both fuel collection and energy use than the Electrostatic Ramscoop, but which is utterly massive in size.

Additionally, analyzing the albedo of passive objects such as asteroids can reveal the composition of surface deposits at a low accuracy."
	description "To increase the sensitivity of the instrument, certain component sensors require constant cooling to microkelvin scale temperatures. The heat pump system responsible for maintaining this requires a surprising amount of energy, while also producing a small amount of waste heat."

A small ultraviolet laser can speed this process up for asteroids by vaporizing a small surface sample, making the spectral lines much more visible, but is sadly useless against shielded ships and their internal systems."
	description "Unfortunately, while Avgi sensors excel in reading basic physical and chemical information, such as the composition of an object, the amount of sensor data required to predict an outfit's functionality means this sensor can be quite slow when scanning a ship's complex systems or cargo."
