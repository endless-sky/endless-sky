	description "This modular set of graphene microchannel radiators can be mounted conformally to a ship's hull, improving its ability to radiate away waste heat. The radiative power scales with the temperature of the waste heat being rejected, making Radiative Laminae work better in hotter-running ships."
	description "	Laminae take advantage of special external hardpoints built into most Avgi ships, allowing them to be mounted without taking up any outfit space. However, they also tend to increase the amount of heat absorbed from the local star."

Working in aggregate, the phased array can be used to jam the sensors of missiles from further away, or even blind them with a low-power beam. However, the density of quantum dots required to produce these effects considerably increases the amount of sunlight absorbed by a ship using Concealment Laminae, and such an advanced material does not come cheap."

	description "To the Avgi, a reliable supply of fuel and reaction mass aboard their starships is critical. Even before inventing the hyperdrive, Magnetic Scoops gave their starships superior endurance and performance, allowing them to travel the gulf between the stars at speeds that would have otherwise been impossible. Now, even with faster-than-light travel available, ramscoops are just as critical as before, allowing the Avgi to ply the hyperlanes between the many systems where no fuel depots have been built."
	description "	A powerful bank of lasers ionizes the interstellar medium around ships equipped with these ramscoops, allowing a Magnetic Scoop to collect extra material on top of the naturally charged solar wind. This results in a more predictable supply of fuel, even around stars with solar winds poor in deuterium. Of course, the power the lasers require can be quite considerable, as is the heat produced from compressing the incident plasma."

	description "A plasma magnet gives this ramscoop an unparalleled collection area, allowing it to gather incredible amounts of fuel. By driving an oscillating, out-of-phase current through a pair of coils perpendicular to the passing solar wind, a magnetic field can be introduced to the rarefied plasma that permeates space. This field itself drags free electrons in the plasma in a circular path, inducing a current in an enormous virtual loop that itself generates a proportionally larger quasi-static magnetic field - one that is hundreds of kilometers in diameter in the case of the Plasmadyne Scoop."
	description "	This magnetic field spans a range far larger than what can be generated by any physical loop of wire of reasonable size, while also sparing a starship from carrying an enormous mass of superconducting wire. It does require a rather large amount of power to function, however, and the interaction with the plasma of the interplanetary medium causes a significant amount of drag."

With this plethora of instruments, distant ships can be detected, ranged, and tracked, despite any attempts to hide."
	description "	To increase the sensitivity of the instruments, certain components are cryocooled to temperatures ranging in the low microkelvins. The heat pump system responsible for maintaining this requires a surprising amount of power, while also producing a significant amount of waste heat."

	description "The Avgi never developed shields indigenously, instead being first introduced to the technology by lost explorers from the Deep. Directly copying the technique used in human shields proved unappealing to Avgi scientists, in part due to the totally alien principles involved, so instead they attempted to tap into the shield effect via enormous superconducting magnets, for them a much more mature technology commonly used in efficient energy storage."
	description "	Unfortunately, for its size, you would expect this shield generator to be far more powerful than it actually is. While it is nearly as large as the heaviest human shield generators, it is only about half as strong, while also consuming far more power. Much of this power ends up being shed as waste heat instead of being used to efficiently regenerate a shield, resulting in a generator that can be generously described as anemic."

While their engineering ingenuity is admirable, there is a limit to how far you can take an incomplete picture of the base physics behind shields, and this generator approaches it."
	description "	The limited success of the Avgi shield replication attempts are mitigated somewhat by the fact that the enormous superconducting coils in their shield generators store a similarly enormous amount of energy, making them effectively superconducting magnetic energy storage devices that slowly regenerate shields as a bonus."

	description "While most Avgi starships either use solar arrays or tap energy from their torch drives, sometimes a more consistent power source is desirable. The Lantern is a compact electrostatic gas core fission reactor, which supplies a stable, reliable flow of power to even smaller ships. With uranium plasma intermixed with hydrogen gas, an applied voltage keeps the ionized uranium fuel contained in the reactor core while the superheated hydrogen is allowed to flow through a compact magnetohydrodynamic generator. The high temperatures involved allow the reactor to achieve a surprisingly high thermodynamic efficiency for its size, at the cost of producing significant amounts of waste heat."

The Avgi use gas core nuclear fission thermal rockets for smaller ships that need a better thrust-to-weight ratio than electric propulsion can provide, but are not large enough to justify a multi-hundred ton fusion torch. Impressive specific powers are achieved through performant fuels such as U-233 or Am-242m, but this also makes these engines rather expensive."
	description "	The Vapor Gas Core Nuclear Thermal Rocket is derived from the same reactor design as the Lantern Fission Core, stripped of power conversion equipment and radiation shielding. Like the Lantern, an electrostatic field of a few volts is used to trap ionized uranium plasma in the reactor even as hot hydrogen flows freely. The engine is bimodal, producing a small trickle of power from thermionic converters, but this capability comes at the cost of constant heat generation."

Just before the invention of the hyperdrive, however, the Avgi perfected this beam-core antimatter drive, capable of pushing a starship with sufficient antimatter fuel to 0.4c and perhaps beyond. Requiring immense quantities of antimatter, the amat farms around Anax such as Antivli Station would have been strained to their limits had this design entered mass production, but the surprise invention of the hyperdrive rendered it laughably obsolete overnight."

By cooling the fuel with a laser and passing it through an extremely powerful magnetic field, it can be spin polarized, aligning the nuclear spins of the deuterons to reduce ignition requirements and direct some of the emitted neutrons away from the spacecraft. While spin polarization is used on all Avgi fusion torches, it allows the Spark in particular to be far lighter and more compact than would otherwise be possible, reducing the required currents to drive the pinch and the mass of the necessary radiation shielding."

An annular flow surrounding the pinch keeps it stable, confining the plasma long enough for nearly all of the fuel to be burned by the time it makes its way down the length of the engine and out the magnetic nozzle on its rear. Without the need for fragile, heavy magnets or bulky lasers to ignite and confine the fusion reaction, the resulting drive is incredibly efficient and compact, which has made it the mainstay of Avgi spacecraft propulsion for centuries."

At this scale, the pinch is long enough that it is able to confine the plasma for sufficient time to not only fuse the deuterium into a mix of helium-3 and tritium, but to likewise burn the aforementioned fusion products together with leftover deuterium to release even more energy. This reaction, known as catalyzed D-D fusion, gives the Arc superior fuel efficiency over its smaller cousins."

	description "Avgi reaction control thrusters are hybrid thermal-electric thrusters, designed to allow translation in any direction. By using reactor heat to expel superheated water vapor out of a set of nozzles, they can help a ship cool off, but require the ship to have excess heat in order to function."

	description "The Avgi have designed their reaction control thrusters to synergize with their fusion torches, tapping off high temperature waste heat and using it to superheat water for use in their reaction control systems. An additional magnetohydrodynamic accelerator around each thruster's nozzle improves specific impulse at the cost of significant energy use. These thrusters allow Avgi starships to easily dock with stations or other ships without igniting their highly radioactive fusion torches."

	description "This large set of 'teakettle' style reaction control thrusters can allow even the largest of Avgi starships to maneuver with ease, or even reverse course without needing to fully turn around. They also can be used to reject considerable amounts of waste heat by expelling superheated water vapor, boosted by an electromagnetic accelerator."

	description "This slim laser rifle can be tuned to produce a beam across a wide spectrum of settings, resulting in a versatile small arm suitable for both ground combat and boarding operations. A solid-state emitter works anywhere between the near-infrared to blue-green, and with a wide range of power and pulse length settings. While the low end of the near-infrared range is nominally eye-safe, even a diffuse reflection of the visible light beam can cause instant blindness, so users of this rifle must wear specialized goggles that darken when exposed to bright light. Incidentally, this makes the Optical Laser Rifle especially dangerous for unprepared foes, such as unwelcome intruders or enemy boarding parties."
	description "	Both the aiming scope and laser aperture share the same focusing mirror, eliminating scope parallax and allowing auto-focusing optics to easily aim the beam at anything the user can see in the scope."

	description "A fine board for the Avgi game of Trefoil, handcrafted from rare Integral Wood and gifted to you by Speaker Wisteria. The wood is engraved and inlaid with bands of silver, while the three sets of stones are made from polished lapis, jade, and garnet, well-worn from countless games."
	description "	You suppose the dense wood would make an adequate blunt weapon in a pinch, though it would be a shame to damage such a fine piece in something so crass as melee combat."

	description "This mysterious radioactive tumor, while benign, has grown unnaturally in the center of your chest, creating a glowing dragonfly-shaped patch in the middle of your sternum. Enemies panic and flee at the sight of it, but only when possession of a disabled starship is contested. Also, you really shouldn't be able to see this 'outfit.'"
