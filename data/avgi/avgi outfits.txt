	description "This modular set of graphene microchannel radiators can be mounted conformally to a ship's hull, improving its ability to radiate away waste heat. The radiative power scales with the temperature of the waste heat being rejected, making Radiative Laminae work better in hotter-running ships."

Working in aggregate, the phased array can be used to jam the sensors of missiles from further away, or even blind them with a low-power beam. However, the density of quantum dots required to produce these effects considerably increases the amount of sunlight absorbed by a ship using Concealment Laminae, and such an advanced material does not come cheap."

	description "To the Avgi, a reliable supply of fuel and reaction mass aboard their starships is critical. Even before inventing the hyperdrive, magnetic scoops gave their starships superior endurace and performance, allowing them to travel the gulf between the stars at speeds that would have otherwise been impossible. Now, with faster-than-light travel available, ramscoops are just as critical as before, allowing the Avgi to ply the hyperlanes between the many systems where no refineries or stations have been built, and also to fuel their powerful but hungry fusion torches."
	description "A powerful bank of lasers ionizes the interstellar medium around ships equipped with these ramscoops, allowing a magnetic scoop to collect extra material on top of the naturally charged solar wind. This results in a more predictable supply of fuel, even around stars with solar winds poor in deuterium. Of course, the power required for the lasers can be quite considerable."

	description "A plasma magnet gives this ramscoop an unparalleled collection area, allowing it to gather incredible amounts of fuel. By driving an oscillating, out-of-phase current through a pair of coils perpendicular to the passing solar wind, a magnetic field can be introduced to the rarefied plasma that permeates space. This field itself drags free electrons in the plasma in a circular path, inducing a current in an enormous virtual loop that itself generates a proportionally larger quasi-static magnetic field, hundreds of kilometers in diameter in the case of the Plasmadyne Ramscoop."
	description "This magnetic field spans a range far larger than what can be generated by any physical loop of wire of reasonable size, while also sparing a starship from carrying an enormous mass of superconducting wire. It does require a rather large amount of power to function, however, and the interaction with the plasma of the interplanetary medium causes a significant amount of drag."

	description "The Avgi never developed shields indigenously, instead being first introduced to the technology by lost explorers from the Deep. Directly copying the technique used in human shields proved unappealing to Avgi scientists, in part due to the totally alien principles involved, so instead they attempted to replicate the shield effect via enormous superconducting magnets, a far more mature technology."
	description "Unfortunately, for its size, you would expect this shield generator to be far more powerful than it actually is. While it is nearly as large as the heaviest human shield generators, it is only about half as strong, while also consuming far more power. Much of this power ends up being shed as waste heat instead of being used to efficiently regenerate a shield, resulting in a generator that can be generously described as anemic."

	description "The largest shield generator manufactured by the Avgi is impressive, if only because of how far the Avgi have pushed their practically concept-level theory of shielding principles. While their engineering ingenuity is admirable, there is a limit to how far you can take an incomplete understanding of the base physics behind shielding, and this generator approaches it."
	description "The limited success of the Avgi shield replication attempts are mitigated somewhat by the fact that the enormous superconducting coils in their shield generators store a similarly enormous amount of energy, making them effectively superconducting magnetic energy storage devices that slowly regenerate shields as a bonus."

The Lantern is a compact dusty plasma fission reactor designed to fill this role, providing a stable, reliable flow of power while fitting on even smaller ships. By suspending uranium dust in a hydrogen plasma, which is in turn contained by a magnetic field, the reactor can achieve incredible core temperatures high enough to make it surprisingly efficient for its size, at the cost of producing significant amounts of waste heat."

Being propellant agnostic, it is common to see magnetoplasmadynamic drives run with water or ammonia propellants, adding to their renowned flexibility."

By cooling the fuel with a laser and passing it through an extremely powerful magnetic field, it can be spin polarized, aligning the nuclear spins of the deuterons to reduce ignition requirements and direct some of the emitted neutrons away from the spacecraft. While spin polarization is used on all Avgi fusion torches, it allows the Spark in particular to be far lighter and more compact than would otherwise be possible, reducing the required currents to drive the pinch and the mass of the necessary radiation shielding."

An annular flow surrounding the pinch keeps it stable, confining the plasma long enough for nearly all of the fuel to be burned by the time it makes its way down the length of the engine and out the magnetic nozzle on its rear. Without the need for fragile, heavy magnets or bulky lasers to ignite and confine the fusion reaction, the resulting drive is incredibly efficient and compact, which has made it the mainstay of Avgi spacecraft propulsion for centuries."

At this scale, the pinch is long enough that it is able to confine the plasma for sufficient time to not only fuse the deuterium into a mix of helium-3 and tritium, but to likewise burn the aforementioned fusion products together with leftover deuterium to release even more energy. This reaction, known as catalyzed D-D fusion, gives the Arc unprecedented fuel efficiency over its smaller cousins."

	description "The fastest Avgi starships were propelled not just by their engines, but also by immense banks of lasers and particle beams stationed in the Anax system, pushing ships to velocities in excess of 0.2c before braking with a magsail or plasma magnet. Just before the invention of the hyperdrive, however, the Avgi perfected this beam-core antimatter drive, capable of pushing a starship with sufficient antimatter fuel to 0.4c and perhaps beyond. Requiring immense quantities of antimatter, the amat farms around Anax such as Antivli Station would have been strained to their limits had this design entered mass production, but the surprise invention of the hyperdrive rendered it laughably obsolete overnight."

	description "This slim coilgun rifle fires a small metallic glass flechette with deadly accuracy. While those intended for ground combat can easily achieve muzzle velocities in the high hypersonic regime, this version, adapted for shipboard combat, is deliberately undervolted to reduce the risk of overpenetrating and breaching a ship's hull."
