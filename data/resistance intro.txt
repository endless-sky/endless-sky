				goto waitforalondo

			`	You explain that you were sent here by Freya, as you recently talked with her about an alien group wanting to see her.`
			`	"Wait, wait, before you tell us everything, you'll need to tell Alondo all of this later anyway, right?" Ijs says. "So, to save you the trouble of repeating the same story, what do you say we get lunch now, and you tell all of us later?"`
				goto waitforalondo

			`	You look for a nice restaurant and get some food, as Ijs and Katya chat with you about their days and activities in the Conservatory. You also give them some insight on how you've been going around the galaxy.`
			`	Ijs gets a message, saying that it's from Alondo, so they pay the bill and head to your ship.`
			`	When you meet with Alondo in his office, he greets you all, and you start to give everyone a comprehensive summary about Coalition space, the Heliarch, and the Resistance, who you've been working with.`
			`	You mention that if any at all, the Jump Drives the Coalition has are very few, while making sure to assure them that you're not asking for any help, just that Freya thought they should know.`
			`	"Well, of course we should, these aliens are one jump away from our territory..." Alondo sighs.`
			`	"Whether they can reach us or not, and regardless of if they are a threat or not, it's always better to know these things," Ijs says. "Captain, how does human tech compare to that of these "Heliarch" and their ships?"`
			choice
				`	"It doesn't."`
				`	"I've met with many alien species, and they're some of the more advanced I've seen."`
			`	You go on about how the Heliarch have taken over the three Quarg ringworlds there, and about how there are no Quarg in there, as the Heliarch claim to have beaten them and banished from their territory.`
			`	"So they're stronger than the Quarg?" Katya asks.`
			choice
				`	"No, I don't know the details, or if they're even telling the truth, but there really are three ringworlds there."`
				`	"Not really, but their technology and weapons apparently were tailored to counter Quarg ships."`
			`	Alondo gets up and starts walking around his office as you do your best to describe Heliarch ships, and how you've smuggled in equipment for the Resistance to have their own counters to them.`
			`	"Did you bring them some of our weapons?" He asks, and you nod, noting that Resistance was especially interested in the heat weapons the Free Worlds developed.`
			`	Once Katya and Ijs manage to calm him down, he says, "Bring me your ship's logs, plus whatever you have on this Coalition. I'll need to bring them up with the senate... and probably Earth's Parliament too."`
			choice
				`	"Logs or not, it's just the word of one pilot, not like it's a full investigation done by Navy Intelligence."`
				`	"Are you sure they'll listen? I have my logs of course, but it's tough to explain all of this to them."`
			`	"Well, you're a hero from the war, so they won't consider it just some gibberish or paranoia from some pilot," he replies. "I'll make sure of that when I present the information to them."`
			`	You head to your ship, handing him all the information you've gathered from your ship's scanners, plus records on their outfitters and shipyards, although no Heliarch technology is sold in those.`
			`	Alondo thanks you for bringing that to his attention, and the four of you hang around for a bit, in a more laid back atmosphere as you discuss mundane activities, if only to put Alondo's mind at ease.`
			`	You say your goodbyes, and you head back to your ship. Time to head back to Freya.`
