			`	The message clears shortly after you finish reading it, and a bit of smoke starts leaving the device. Realizing the referred outfit in the message was the interference plating, you quickly calculate that 20 of those would cost you 1,000,000 credits, but if the part about the payment is true, you'd be paid 2,000,000 credits after completing the delivery. Every cargo job you have done in the Coalition so far was either posted on a job board, or the client coming to you personally, and none ever involved you bringing outfits from human space, so whoever sent this might be working in a black market of sorts.

			`	You explain that you were sent here by Freya, as you recently talked with her about an alien group wanting to see her.`
			`	"Wait, wait, before you tell us everything, you'll need to tell Alondo all of this later anyway, right?" Ijs says. "So, to save you the trouble of repeating the same story, what do you say we get lunch now, and you tell all of us later?"`
				goto waitforalondo

			`	You look for a nice restaurant and get some food as Ijs and Katya chat with you about their days and activities in the Conservatory. You also give them some insight on how you've been traveling the galaxy. Ijs gets a message from Alondo, so they pay the bill and you three head to meet him.`
			`	When you arrive at Alondo's office, he greets you all. You give everyone a comprehensive summary about Coalition space, the Heliarch, and the Resistance, who you've been working with.`
			`	You mention that the Coalition has few - or no - jump drives and assure them you're not asking for any help, just that Freya thought they should know.`
			`	"Well, of course we should know. These aliens are one jump away from our territory..." Alondo sighs.`
			`	"Regardless of whether they can reach us or if they're a threat, it's always better to know these things," Ijs says. "Captain, how does human tech compare to that of the "Heliarch" and their ships?"`
			choice
				`	"It doesn't."`
				`	"I've met with many alien species, and they're some of the more advanced I've seen."`
			`	You go on about how the Heliarch have taken over the three ringworlds there, the lack of Quarg, and the Heliarch's claim that they banished the Quarg themselves.`
			`	"So they're stronger than the Quarg?" Katya asks.`
			choice
				`	"I don't know the details, or if they're even telling the truth, but there really are three ringworlds there."`
				`	"I don't know, but their technology and weapons were apparently tailored to counter Quarg ships."`
			`	Alondo gets up and starts walking around his office as you do your best to describe Heliarch ships and how you've smuggled in equipment for the Resistance to have their own counters to them.`
			`	"Did you bring them some of our weapons?" He asks, and you nod, noting that Resistance was especially interested in the heat weapons the Free Worlds developed.`
			`	Once Katya and Ijs speak with him about it, he says, "Bring me your ship's logs, plus whatever you have on this Coalition. I'll need to bring them up with the senate - and probably Earth's Parliament too."`
			choice
				`	"Logs or not, it's just the word of one pilot. It's not a full investigation done by Navy Intelligence."`
				`	"Are you sure they'll listen? I have my logs of course, but it's tough to explain all of this to them."`
			`	"Well, you're something of a war hero now, so they won't consider it just gibberish or paranoia from some pilot," he replies. "I'll make sure of that when I present the information to them."`
			`	You return to your ship and copy all of the information from your ship's scanners and the records of Coalition outfitters. Even though you don't have much information on Heliarch technology, what data you do have should be better than nothing.`
			`	Alondo thanks you for bringing that to his attention, and the four of you hang around for a bit, in a more laid back atmosphere as you discuss mundane activities, if only to put Alondo's mind at ease.`
			`	You say your goodbyes, and you head back to your ship. Time to head back to Freya.`
