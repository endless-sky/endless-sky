			`The mood in the spaceport is solemn. No one has had time yet to count up the losses, on both sides of the battle, but it is likely that over a thousand lives were lost. And because the Navy is held in such high regard even here where Parliament and the Paradise Planets are viewed with disgust, many of the militia captains are almost as saddened by the loss of Navy lives as by the loss of some of their own.`

If we strike quickly, we could be able to retake Kornephoros from them. It's important to break the blockade on that system just for the sake of trade with the rest of the galaxy, and on top of that, of course, Katya needs to be rescued."`
			`	"Indeed," you say.
			`	"We have a large fleet of reinforcements coming in from the Rim," he continues, "and a few ships here that are able to fight another battle. I need you to take off with them, wait for the reinforcements to arrive, and then retake Kornephoros. If the Navy ships retreat, let them retreat. If they surrender, let them surrender. If they stay and fight, disable them if you can, destroy them if you must. Understood?"`

			`The last of the Navy vessels in orbit has been subdued. As you land, you find that several Free Worlds troop transports have already set down in the spaceport and corralled the remaining Navy officers into a small circle. You would estimate that there are several hundred Navy prisoners. Another transport lands, carrying more prisoners: the Navy troops who had been guarding the mines on Clink.`
			`	For several hours, nothing changes: the Navy troops are huddled into a small circle, surrounded by guards. When lunchtime comes, some of the guards go to the market and fetch some of the vendors who sell meals out of carts there; they return with the carts and hand out food to the prisoners. Then, another transport lands and Tomek steps out.`

			`	Tomek climbs up onto the hull of a nearby ship and addresses the prisoners. "Hello," he says. A few of the Navy officers respond, warily. "My name is Tomek Voigt," he says. "Our militia is very loosely organized, but I'm the one in charge of organizing it." That gets a few laughs from the Free Worlds guards. "As such, I am responsible for deciding your fate."`
			`	At that, a hush falls over the crowd. "The Council has decided," he continues, "that any of you who gives us your parole, swearing to take no further part in fighting the Free Worlds, will be returned to Republic space. You will give us your word of honor that you will either seek reassignment in another part of the galaxy, or resign your commission."`
			`	A few of the Free Worlds guards shout, "What?" But only a surprising few. The rest are nodding, seemingly pleased with the Council's choice. Tomek climbs down from the hull and approaches the prisoners, and you notice Alondo and Freya have joined him.`
			`	One of the Navy officers stands up. "I'll take that oath," he says, "if you'll honor your part of it."`
			`	Tomek takes the man's hands, looks him in the eyes, and asks, "Do you swear before God and these witnesses to take no further part in military actions against the Free Worlds?"`
			`	"I do," says the officer. Several of the other prisoners stand up, and before long all but a handful have sworn the oath.`
			`	After they finish, Tomek turns to you and a few other captains. "Emily, Marco, <first>, Sarah, please meet me in the spaceport cafe when you are ready." He walks off.`

			`When you land on <origin>, it seems that everyone in the spaceport is talking about a recent news story: the Navy has just announced the formation of a new regiment, called the Oathkeepers. This regiment is staffed mostly by prisoners you paroled from Kornephoros, who want to honor their oath to take no further part in the conflict against the Free Worlds. They will be headquartered on Farpoint, in the far north, to defend that region of space against pirate incursions.`
			`	Furthermore, the leader of the Oathkeepers will be General Danforth, an elderly general who is something of a folk hero and is spoken of with admiration and respect even here in Free space. Although he was not one of the paroled prisoners, he has become an outspoken advocate for a diplomatic solution to the Free Worlds conflict.`
			`	It's heartening news, but you also can't help noticing how many people in the spaceport are talking now about how the Navy really is full of "decent" and "honorable" people, and it's a shame that the Free Worlds had to fight them. By responding to your generous gesture with one of their own, the Navy has won a definite political victory, and given that they needed to defend the North anyways, it is a victory that cost them very little.`

			`	Soon after you land, the governor of Poisonwood sends an aide to escort you to her office. The governor is a woman probably in her late fifties, and as you are speaking the sunlight occasionally catches her face or arms at exactly the right angle to show the faint, criss-crossing lines of very old scars.

				`	"What was the Disappearance?"`
			
			`	"I was a teenage slave working in the factories at the time," she says. "Exactly the wrong age, as it turned out. One day the overseers informed us that all the eighteen year old girls had to have mandatory 'health checkups' that day. I won't describe what the 'checkup' involved, but it was bewildering and unpleasant. And nearly all those girls disappeared, that day. They never returned from the 'checkups.' Only a few of us were left behind. Most of the leftovers were girls who had been unlucky enough to already be pregnant at that age. Or lucky, as it turned out. But I didn't understand why they didn't take me."`
			`	Alondo seems very disturbed by the story. "They were selling girls into prostitution?" he says.`
			`	"That's what we assumed," she says, "but there were dozens of girls like me who were not taken, even though we were not pregnant. It didn't make sense. Anyways, somehow news of that event got off-world and not long after, the Navy came in massive numbers, destroyed the slaver fleets and liberated our planet. In the process, they tried to invade an underground facility up in the mountains, which is where they thought the girls were being kept. But the facility was rigged to self-destruct, and they never found out what had been going on inside the facility. No one inside it survived."`
			choice
				`	"Did you ever find out why they let you go?"`
			
			`	"My parents said it was because I was so willful and stubborn, too hard to control," she says. "But years later, we began to discover that all of us who were passed over had one thing in common. We were all infertile. Had been already, the day of the Disappearance. Which means that either a bunch of pirates had suddenly decided they wanted to leave behind their lives of crime and settle down and raise families... or those girls were being used as incubators."`
			`	Alondo says, "I hear that was common during the Alpha wars. Alpha genetics were so unstable, they needed hundreds of test subjects to produce a handful of viable Alpha babies. Those were evil days."`
			`	"Days that may yet return," she says. "Somewhere, maybe even nearby on Bloodsea or Greenrock or Albatross, the remnants of the Alphas may still be hiding.

			`You arrive back on Longjump to a hero's welcome. People have heard of the battle you fought on Thule and the deal that was forged with the locals there. JJ and Freya greet you too, and congratulate you. But then Freya says, "We need to talk in private."`
			`	You lead them into your ship, where Freya explains, "Soon after you left for Thule, Tomek took off on his own and raised a fleet for an attack on Greenrock. He thought the Senate's plan of making a deal with the pirate worlds was too cowardly, and that we needed a show of strength instead. But he was defeated by the pirates. His fleet retreated, with heavy losses, and when they landed back on Trinket, Tomek was put under house arrest by order of the Senate."`

			`	JJ and Freya are both quiet for a minute, then Freya says, "You know, there are people in the Senate who worry that the Council could become the ruling authority in the Free Worlds, instead of a democratic Senate. It wouldn't be the first time a people's revolution turned into an oligarchy. We of the council have to be careful not to let that happen."`

				`	"So we're just going to let Tomek stay under arrest?"`

			`	"Well, thanks to you, the Men system is no longer engaged in piracy," says JJ. "And that means the folks on Smuggler's Den are in need of new work. That station used to be a deuterium refinery. With a little work, it can be one, again."`
			`	"A working refinery could bring more income to that system than piracy ever did," says Freya. "Only problem is, the replacement parts are rare, and hard to come by. The Syndicate agreed to sell us the parts, but only if we meet them halfway, on Tundra. That's in the Cebalrai system. Just one jump away from one of the major new Navy bases."`
			choice
				`	"We're going to take a supply convoy through Republic space?"`
					goto convoy
				`	"How do we know this isn't a trap?"`
			`	"We don't," says Freya, "except that the Syndicate is greedy, and we have money. I don't think they're ready yet to give up on the chance to sell their wares to both sides in this war."`
			`	"Still, how do they expect us to get a convoy safely to Tundra?"`
			label convoy
			`	"Not a convoy," says JJ. "Just you, captain. It's only ten tons of spare parts. Your job is to fly to Tundra, retrieve the parts, and return here."`

				`	"I hope this doesn't turn out to be a suicide mission."`
			`	"I hope so too," says Freya. "If your ship has enough fuel capacity, you might try flying over to the neutral territory of Dabih or Tarazed, and then up to Cebalrai from there, to avoid the worst of the Navy patrols. Good luck, Captain. If anyone can do it, you can."`
