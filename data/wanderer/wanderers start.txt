		conversation
			`You hurry into the hospital room. Rek's skin is now almost entirely bare aside from the withered, stringy black feathers that have grown in place of the once rich plumage. Rek's eyes spring open when you enter the room. "You have news," Rek says. "I can see it in your expression. What did you see?" Given how hard it is to read alien facial expressions, it would be quite remarkable if Rek could actually tell anything from looking at your face, but it would not be polite to say so.`

				`	"Something has begun in the Sko'karak system, a cosmological phenomenon my ship's sensors did not recognize. It may be the Eye, beginning to open."`
				`	"There is some sort of cosmological phenomenon, but it is not a wormhole. I do not want to offer you false hope."`
			`	"It is the Eye," says Rek. "I am sure of it. It comes too late to save us from the great losses we have suffered, but perhaps not too late to preserve our species from destruction. So, my waiting is at an end."`
			`	Rek calls to one of the nurses. The hospital bed is on wheels, and they quickly detach it from the various machines on the walls. Esta'a, Rek's mother, comes into the room and explains to you, "The room of [seclusion, isolation] is deeper underground. They will [wash, sterilize] Rek's body, then wait a week to check for any [residual, hidden] contamination, then begin to administer the drugs that will stop Rek's body from [fighting, resisting] the transformation. Even if all goes well, we will not see Rek again for a long time, and never again in this [body, form]."`
			choice
				`	"Don't worry. Rek is strong enough to survive this."`
					goto hallway
				`	"Will you let me know what happens, regardless of the outcome?"`
			`	"I will," she says. "Unless, of course, some great [calamity? upheaval?] befalls us and we are too caught up in other [matters, necessities]."`
			label hallway
			`	Three Wanderer nurses come and wheel Rek's bed out the door and into an elevator. At Rek's request, you join them. The elevator opens up to a wide and vaulted hallway lined on either side by Wanderers dressed in black, come to pay their last respects to Rek. It is like something out of a dream: the subterranean passage dense with the stately forms of Wanderer officials, the black-cloaked wings and shadows contrasting with the bright linen of the hospital bed and the white plumage of Rek's mother as she follows the cart to the threshold of the isolation chamber.`
			`	The door of the chamber snaps shut with a pneumatic hiss, and you make your way back up to the spaceport with the other visitors. One of the visitors is Emeka'a Isai, the former governor of Varu Mer'ek. She pulls you aside and says, "You should not [remain, dawdle] here, human. They will have need of you at the [front, battle line]. And the sight of you may be unwelcome to some of the [mourners? associates?] of Rek who are here."`

				`	"Wait, why would people be angry at me after all I've done to help?"`
			`	"Not angry at you," she says, "but some say the Molt is [triggered, provoked] by exposure to [alien, foreign] things: that your coming is what made Rek's body begin its [change, metamorphosis] too soon." She is silent for a moment, then says, "Please, do not be [concerned, grieved]. Rek may yet live, and rise to great renown as the first of a new [generation, race]. In any event, that is the past. Go, now, and help us to [secure, obtain] a future."`

			`As you are coming in for a landing here you think you see a few Wanderer ships of yet another unfamiliar design, even larger than the Tempest. Their level of military technology has risen at an incredible rate since the Unfettered invasion began, even if it is true that they are just putting ancient ship and weapon designs back into production rather than inventing them anew.`
			`	But the new technology cannot completely offset the fact that no living Wanderer has any real military experience. So, several of their leaders here are eager to talk with you, and you spend hours telling them stories from your recent experience in the war in human space. Sobari Tele'ek, the military commander, is among them. Your conversation is interrupted when sirens begin to sound in the spaceport. "The Hai are approaching!" says Tele'ek. "Please join us in battle, one more time."`

			`The Wanderers here seem incredulous that they managed to drive off such a powerful Unfettered attack force. As you walk through the spaceport, many of them stop to thank you for your assistance in defending their home.`
			`	Just as you reach the pavilion where the military leaders are gathering, a shadow falls over you, and you look up to see two ships approaching with the unmistakable horned silhouettes of Pug warships. Throughout the spaceport you hear Wanderer voices raised in excitement, and hundreds of them leap into the air to accompany the Pug ships to the landing pad. Sobari Tele'ek says to you, "It is a [visitation, appearance] of the Keepers! In our hour of [need, desperation] they make themselves known at last." A small delegation of Pug disembarks from the ships and approaches the pavilion on foot.`
			choice
				`	"Let's hope that they offer you more help than they did last time I talked with them."`

			label pug
			`	The Pug delegation reaches the pavilion, and one of them begins speaking in the Wanderer language. You have no idea what they are saying, and they all seem to be ignoring your presence. A few of the Wanderer leaders respond. There's an awful lot of fanning of wings, flipping of tails, and preening of feathers going on. That might be the Wanderer way of trying to make a good impression, or else they're just feeling pleased with themselves. Or maybe they're nervous; it's hard to tell.`
			`	The Pug finish their conversation with the Wanderers and return to their ships, and only then does Sobari Tele'ek turn to you and say, "Great news! They say that their two ships will [patrol, remain in] this system and [hold off, hold at bay] the Hai fleets. Also," he adds, preening himself, "they are very pleased with us for [growing, becoming] so strong. And, they say we need not [fight? worry about?] the Hai anymore."`

			`A few minutes after you land on <planet>, a sudden uproar passes through the Wanderers in the spaceport. It's hard to be sure, but you think they sound excited, not frightened. Ships start taking off, more and more of them until the spaceport is almost deserted, and no one who is left seems at all interested in talking with you or explaining what is going on. You're probably going to have to return to your ship and see for yourself what all the fuss is about.`
