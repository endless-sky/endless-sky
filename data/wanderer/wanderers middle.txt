				`	"I think Tele'ek is right. The Mereti drones are already plenty dangerous without access to advanced computing technology."`

			`	You try to speak up, but the Wanderers are so hotly engaged in conversation that they have switched from the common language of the Hai back into their own native tongue, and you have no idea what they are saying. Eventually the debate ends, and Tele'ek says, "Very well, we will attempt this thing. Not because it is the [wise, certain] course of action, but because it is [in keeping with Wanderer values?]."`

"It did not feel like a peace summit, but like a child's play at a peace summit, as if negotiating for peace is a skill they are only just beginning to learn. And the terms they asked for were minimal; I would have preferred to offer them far more. But they are taking steps toward becoming a peaceful society, and for that we can be grateful."`

He pauses before continuing. "[Hopefully, If this goes well], they will not get much use, but will see you [safely, successfully] through this [mission, task] to finally end this [blight, menace].

			`	Tele'ek explains, "If they view these weapons as signs of [aggression?] against themselves, there is little I can do for them. Their ships are not as [durable, well-armored] as the Kor Sestor automata, so our other technologies would already be [effective, damaging] enough if used against them. If they are [rational, intelligent], they will value the added protection on this [journey, endeavor]."`
