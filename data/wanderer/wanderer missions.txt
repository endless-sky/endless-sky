			`The Mereti have clearly been expanding their greenhouses since you last visited this world. A few smaller drones gather around as your ship comes in to land, and they welcome you as you step out.`
			`	Then, without giving you time to properly respond, they shepherd you into one particular greenhouse, slightly larger than the others. Within, a single plant sits in a majestic pot in the center, illuminated by a shaft of light through the windows above. It is small, with vibrant deep blue petals and teal leaves, and despite your lack of familiarity with it you can tell that it is not growing well.`
			`	One of the drones speaks to you, much more quietly than the last time you spoke with them. "You are our friend. You helped to [defend, protect] us when we were attacked. You brought our [parents? ancestors?] to us. Please, help us again."`
			choice
				`	"I will help you."`
				`	"What do you need me to do?"`
			`	The drone speaks again. "This plant is important to us. It is our..." The drone pauses for a few seconds, and lights flash across it. "It is important to us. Our [teachers, mentors] say it is not [native, local] to this world, and cannot survive here." As it says this, two Wanderers walk in accompanied by another Mereti drone, talking with each other in hushed tones. They look up when the drone you are speaking with mentions them, and quickly approach you.`
			choice
				`	"Can you help them?"`
				`	"What should we do?"`
			`	One of the Wanderers speaks up. "This plant... it shares crucial similarities with some of the plants that we [grow, tend] on <planet>, so let us bring it there for now. There will be [differences, complications], but that is the [best, most likely] [approach, solution] in the short term. But we still seek to leave these worlds to the Unfettered, and so we cannot [house, cultivate] this plant there forever."`
			`	The drones, which have been silently listening to the two Wanderers, carefully pick up the pot containing the plant, and fly back in the direction of your ship, followed by the two Wanderers. You follow them back and prepare to set off for <planet>.`

			`	Your passengers exit your ship almost immediately after you land, and the spaceport workers carefully unload the plant from your cargo hold. "Meet us in the spaceport and we will inform you of our next [plans, steps]."`

			`	Va'ika pauses and thinks for a moment before continuing. "The Korath do not seem to me to be the type to [create, engineer] such a flower through [artificial, unnatural] means. I suspect it originates on one of their worlds. If we are fortunate, it may [grow, prosper] there still. From an initial look, we [believe, suspect] that it is native to either <planet>, Sopi Lefarkata, or possibly one of those worlds that is so [damaged, destroyed] that it is difficult to [see, imagine] what it might once have been like."`

			`Va'ika guides you to an area of high, cool steppes as you approach. You find a suitable place to land your ship, and she steps out. The air that blows in through the open door sting your eyes, but Va'ika seems too deep in thought to notice. "It would have [grown, originated] here, I am certain of it. But it will do so no longer, not for many [years, cycles]." Va'ika bows her head and holds one wing in front of herself silently for a moment before continuing.

You can feel its similarity to the steppe you visited on Solima Skarati, but this time you can breathe freely, without the air stinging your eyes and mouth.

This is far closer to the purpose we originally [conceived, designed] them to [serve, fulfill]." You catch a glimpse of a feather falling to the ground as she speaks. Then, she interrupts herself.
