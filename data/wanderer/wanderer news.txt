			"Many buildings near the spaceport have plants growing on their roofs. An indignant squawk draws your attention to a Wanderer as they rapidly flap away from an automated watering system dousing them where they stood."
			"Outside the spaceport, you see a Wanderer performing maintainence on some sort of irrigation system. Once they get it working, it begins to water a field of plants."
			"A Wanderer dockworker unloads scientific equipment from a ship. More suprising, however, is the fact that they unload several bags of fertilizer from it as well."

			"As you walk by a group of Wanderers, they begin to coo and chitter at you. Evidently they have not seen something like you before."
			"A group of Wanderer children appear to be playing a game similar to hopscotch, but instead of hopping they fly to their spots."
			"On a booth near the spaceport, a group of Wanderers are playing on objects that look vaguely like wooden flutes. Their music is quiet and lacks a discernable melody."
