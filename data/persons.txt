			"Long years of technological development were for me a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural."
			"What were you thinking about when you hailed me? 'Oh look, an asteroid. Let's chat.'"
			"How does it feel to try hailing an asteroid and actually succeeding?"
			"What a day to be a non-sentient rock floating in the middle of the eternal void."
			"When even the local asteroid belt starts chatting with you, you can tell you've been jumping a little too much lately."
			"What's weirder, an asteroid that emits purple rays or the person that tried to talk with it?"
			"My goals are beyond your understanding."
			"What the Quarg say about the Builders is false. I am the only one responsible for their extinction, and I am proud of it."
			"You think that nuclear weapons are bad? Come closer and you will see what a real weapon is."
			"I have been classified as a weapon of mass destruction by most human and alien governments. You don't want to see what I am capable of."
			"Sometimes, just for fun, I set myself on a close trajectory on an inhabited planet and pass just above their atmosphere. I love how lesser species start to freak out as they think that the end is near."
			"I have been watching you, <first> <last>, current captain of the <ship>."
			"I am here for you."
			"I want your money."
			"Three Skeleton Key. Three Skeleton Key. Three Skeleton Key. Three Skeleton Key. Three Skeleton Key. Three Skeleton Key. Three Skeleton Key. Three Skeleton Key."
			"Your politics bore me."
			"There is only one being in the whole universe that isn't commanded by AI, and that's me."
			"Shields are useless--I can pass through them just fine. I can show you, if you'd like."
			"The Quarg are wrong saying that the firstborns are long gone, for I am the firstborn."
			"Have you ever been in the Weft? It's so damn boring. It's a lot more fun to mess with simpler minds like yours."
			"I remember when the Archons tried to kill me with some supernovae. They got so depressed when they understood that not even their weapons could stop me."
			"I ate a black hole once. It took me a few years, but it was definitely worth it. Tastes like chicken."
			"I am the only thing in the universe capable of beating the power of friendship."
			"I want to tell you some words of a long gone past, which back then used to scare people of your race more than any weapon or war machine. These words are, 'The MacOS workflow run was not successful.'"

	description "This ship appears to be a hollowed-out asteroid filled with strange equipment. It is unclear what is creating the rays of light, but they must have something to do with how it moves without obvious engines."
	description "	Its advanced properties also allow it to reject the influence of enemy command centers, nullifying their effect."
