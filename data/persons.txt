	description "The origin of this Wardragon is shrouded in mystery. It was said that the Quarg once used this ship as a powerful light warship. Other sources suggest that it was used as a front-line heavy warship. One thing is for certain though, and that's its design is far different than any Quarg ship that exists today, and one can only question where it came from."

			"Long years of technological development were for me a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural."

			"What a day to be a non-sentient rock floating in the middle of the eternal void."
			"When even the local asteroid belt starts chatting with you, you can tell you've been jumping a little too much lately."

			"The Quarg are wrong saying that the firstborns are long gone, for I am the firstborn."
			"Have you ever been in the Weft? It's so damn boring. It's a lot more fun to mess with simpler minds like yours."
			"I remember when the Archons tried to kill me with some supernovae. They got so depressed when they understood that not even their weapons could stop me."
			"I ate a black hole once. It took me a few years, but it was definitely worth it. Tastes like chicken."
			"I am the only thing in the universe capable of beating the power of friendship."
