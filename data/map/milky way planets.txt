	description `This ancient and quiet world, orbiting a dim red sun, is home to the microchip foundries of House Idriss, the Arach guild that specializes in computers and advanced electronics. Outside of the cities, which are clustered around the equator, Ablub's Invention is uninhabited except by the native lifeforms, including strange, spindly-legged quadrupeds, awkward birds with leathery wings, and amphibians with webbed feet and long, whiskered snouts.`
	spaceport `The day-night cycle here is at least three times as long as any of the Coalition's species are habituated to, so the entire city enters a "false nighttime" in the middle of the day, shuttering all the windows so that the locals can rest and reset their biological clocks. And in the middle of the night, the city is brightly lit for a "false day."`
	spaceport `	The local work schedule has adapted to this unusual cycle, with the two true daytime periods serving the equivalent of the human work week, and the false daytime treated as a weekend, a time for socializing or working at home.`

Ada was originally settled as a mining planet, and the mines here still produce a steady stream of metal to supply the Labs and the many other industrial companies here.`
	description `	From above, the planet looks almost lifeless and barren. Most of the major cities on Ada are built into the walls of the canyons, where they are protected from the high winds and occasional dust storms that sweep across the surface.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is built into the walls of a canyon which has been blasted out to create trenches that are hundreds of meters wide and deep, a network of flight lanes that are well marked out with lights and beacons. Behind the docking caves is a bustling subterranean city where bare rock and gleaming metal have been woven together in an architecture that is both functional and elegant. The lighting in the caverns varies over the course of the day to match the sunlight outside.`

The first settlers on Albatross were anarchists who believed that in a society free from unnatural laws and constraints, everyone would happily and freely work for the common good. The next settlers were pirates who believed that a planet free from laws and constraints would be a great base of operations.`
	description `	The anarchist farming communes, each operating independently but trading with outsiders to gain necessary supplies, are clustered in the barely temperate climate near the equator. The pirate bases, having a much more ready source of supplies, are located wherever there are flat landing areas close to craggy, defensible mountains.`
	spaceport `You are glad you put on a warm coat before leaving your ship. The wind blows in strong gusts down the streets of this small spaceport town. You pass by ranchers herding cattle, a few farmers driving old, rusted-out trucks full of produce, and a couple of shady figures huddled in an alleyway negotiating what looks like a drug deal. In the center of town is a small merchant's exchange and a couple of greasy spoon diners.`
	spaceport `	The sign over the spaceport bar reads, "No Gods, No Masters." Below it in slightly smaller writing is another sign which reads, "No Cybernetic Implants. No Badgers, Weasels, Or Polecats." You have no idea what a "polecat" is.`

Today the station is mostly populated by visitors looking for particularly arcane writings or information, and librarians who have devoted their lives to keeping the archives well-indexed and up to date.`

The spaceport itself is a soaring canopy, made to look like a tent, or sails on a ship. But it is built of a sturdy composite of plastic and carbon fiber, and coated in reflective plastic.

Much of the food that they produce each year is either put into storage or simply recycled back into fertilizer for next year's crop.`
	spaceport `The farms on Brass Second operate on a colossal scale. The spaceport is not the sort of rustic farmers' market typical of other farming worlds; it is a major commercial enterprise, complete with cargo-loading robots, climate-controlled warehouses, and a supply chain management system that ensures that fresh produce works its way to the head of the shipping queue in time for it to reach its destination unspoiled.`

The original settlers planned out in exacting detail how every part of the planet's land mass should be used, in order to satisfy their aesthetic ideal of blending residential areas with parks and farms. Large areas have also been set aside as undeveloped wilderness.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is in what, by Saryd standards, is a major city, with scattered skyscrapers surrounded by forests and grassy park land along with smaller dwellings and occasional factories or power plants. The city is built on either side of one of this continent's largest rivers, a few kilometers downstream from a dam and hydroelectric plant. Here, the river cuts through a deep gorge, and the graceful bridges that cross the gorge are often shrouded in mist.`

	description `Deep is a sparsely populated world of small island archipelagos surrounded by vast expanses of empty ocean. There is not enough land for any large cities or serious industry to emerge, so most of the inhabitants live in small fishing villages. The climate is temperate and Earth-like, but the sunlight is somewhat dimmer than you are used to.`
	description `	The fishing settlements are actually the second colonization attempt on this planet. In the early days of hyperdrive the Kingsburg Corporation sent out what was then one of the largest and most technologically advanced colonization fleets, penetrating deep into the then-unexplored southern galactic rim. After two centuries of sporadic and guarded contact, the colony fell silent, and when human expansion finally reached this area again, no trace of the original colony was found.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is built on a large island, a now-extinct volcano with an elevation of several kilometers at its center. Most of the large-scale fishing here is done by a single company, Poseidon Industries, who also built and maintain the spaceport. Steep winding roads and sturdy cement homes and warehouses line the mountain slopes, and below you in the harbor several massive trawling vessels are moored. On the outskirts of the spaceport are the ramshackle houses and open-air marketplace used by the smaller, independent fishing families.`

	spaceport `The entire spaceport on Deep Water is an artificial island, a mesh of floating platforms the size of city blocks connected to each other by flexible bridges, leaving a system of canals in between them. The platforms are large enough that even the weight of a bulk freighter landing only causes them to ride a meter or two lower in the water.`

Some of the mines are as large as a city, and in fact many of the mining cities are under ground, built in sections of old mines that have long since run out of useful metals. With all the mines and underground cities reliant on mechanical ventilation from the surface, the miners live in constant fear of two things: cave-ins, and power failures.`

Beyond the hollow, the mountainside falls off into a steep cliff and a mist-filled valley below. Although the port is well-built and modern, you cannot help an irrational fear that the whole place will slide off the edge of the mountain one day.`

But the mines operate with a joint ownership model where all the workers profit equally, so working here pays well. Many of the miners stay here only for five or ten years, while sending money back to their families off-world.`

However, the powerful tectonic forces here have created rich deposits of diamonds, emeralds, and sapphires, which are mined both for use in jewelry and for certain electronic components.

Today, most of the industry centers around oil drilling and manufacturing, and the remaining workers are those who are too poor to leave.`

Today it remains under government control, because the citizens of the Deep are wary of any private corporation controlling the industry that makes interstellar travel possible.`

	description `New Argentina is a world that is ideal for ranching but suitable for little else. Ranchers live as individual families or small communities surrounded by hectares of grazing land for cattle. As a result, the population is still quite low here, and the locals live isolated lives, with most families living many kilometers away from the nearest school or hospital or even from their nearest neighbor.`
	description `	Cattle handlers here do their work on horseback, because they believe modern vehicles are more likely to spook the animals.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is on the outskirts of one of New Argentina's largest towns... which has a population of barely ten thousand people. Many of the dock workers are teenagers or barely past their teens, children of ranchers who are not drawn to the solitary sort of life that their parents enjoy. Aside from the church and the hospital, the largest building in town is "The Grange," a function hall with a sign out front advertising square dances and line dances three nights a week.`

	description `New Austria is a rugged mountain world, full of snow-capped peaks and valleys so deep and so steep that they rarely see sunlight. The few settlements that have been built here were developed for mining sapphires and rubies; the sapphires found in New Austria range from blue to yellow to black to clear in color, and are used both for industrial abrasives and for jewelry. For centuries the locals have been trying to find a deposit of diamonds, which would sell for much higher prices than sapphires, and local folklore revolves around the prosperity that would come to this world if diamonds were ever discovered.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is nothing but a couple of landing pads built on the outskirts of one of the larger mining villages, high up on a mountain ridge to allow easy access for starships. A few roads lead down from there to the village, where you can trade for local goods or get food from the miners' cafeteria. By the time you have walked to the center of the town, several people have already tried to sell you large "diamonds" that you strongly suspect are just clear sapphires.`

Most of the land is wet and marshy, and the coastal regions are prone to flooding. Some food crops are grown here, but most of the farmers instead plant flax and jute, which grow well in wet soil and are used to make linen and burlap cloth. The textile mills are hot and poorly ventilated, but they offer higher and more reliable income than farming.`
	spaceport `Some day New Boston may be a prosperous enough planet to afford a better spaceport, but not yet. Many of the concrete landing pads have sunk into the muddy soil over the years since they were poured, and are now tilted and uneven. The market where ship captains buy and sell cargo is a large tent rather than a permanent building, but it is sturdy enough to keep off the rain, and high enough for loads to be brought in and out by trucks and the occasional hovercraft. And, some enterprising local mechanics have set up not only a repair shop and outfitter, but also a shipyard with several small, refurbished ships for sale.`

Over time, where the forests are able to take hold and grow, they spread outward and begin to turn more of the rock into habitable soil. On the exposed slopes, rock slides are a constant danger.`
	description `	Due to the limited habitable land, the local economy focuses on high tech medicine and equipment that can be produced by relatively small laboratories.`

The locals here grow food in greenhouses and specialize in making warm winter clothing, which is this planet's only export.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is near the equator, but it is still cold enough that there is always some snow on the ground. In addition to the outdoor landing pads a few hangars are available: an effort by the locals to make their world a little more appealing to merchants passing through the system. You have never seen as many people in fur coats as there are here; what might be considered a luxury in other parts of the galaxy is a necessity here, where the cheapest clothing material is the pelts of indigenous animals.`

It doesn't even use standard landing pads used on most other planets. Instead, the natives seem to have set up some concrete slabs next to some gas pumps and gone back to their lives.

The animals and plants on the land are relatively uninteresting, but the oceans are home to an enormous variety of creatures, including whales the size of a bulk freighter, a highly intelligent species of jellyfish, and other, far stranger creatures that rarely venture up from the sunless ocean depths.`
	description `	To avoid contact with these marine creatures, when the Pug travel to other parts of the planet they use massive solar-powered airships rather than boats.`
	spaceport `The Pug here all seem to be busy with various tasks, none of which make any sense to you: rushing from building to building on their long, spindly legs; playing a game involving colored stones on a hexagonal table; constructing what appears to be collaborative holographic artwork.`
	spaceport `	None of them speak to you, but a worker in the spaceport digs around in a closet for a while and comes up with a conversion attachment that allows your fuel tanks to be filled using their style of fuel nozzle.`

	description `This is one of those rare worlds whose climate is already nearly perfect without the need for terraforming. The Wanderers have made it into a farming planet. The fields follow the natural contours and geology of the land rather than being laid out in rectangular lots like most human farms, and each field contains several different crop species designed to form a symbiotic ecosystem.`
	spaceport `This could be a spaceport on any human farming world, except that the farmers hawking their wares have wings and beaks, and the wagons bringing produce to the market are drawn by massive lizards instead of horses. In several repair shops on the outskirts of town, Wanderer technicians work on massive harvester robots. The robots have four legs to walk on and dozens of dexterous manipulator arms for picking crops, and each arm has a camera eye on it.`

This star system contains an unusually high concentration of metallic asteroids, and as a result they have built many large refineries here to process the ore that their drones harvest.`
	spaceport `The vast majority of ships landing and taking off from this port are unmanned Wanderer drones used for mining asteroids. The drones are maneuverable enough to avoid collisions with the few ships that land under manual control.`
	spaceport `	The port itself is a small village surrounded by towering refineries. Unlike other Wanderer architecture, the refineries are ugly, brutal buildings made of weathered concrete.`

The Wanderers have converted nearly all their villages on this planet into military bases in order to oppose the encroaching Hai raiders, and have also been forced to postpone their attempts at improving the local ecology.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is a massive shipyard, with facilities for repairing the few warships that the Wanderers possess as well as creating new ships and weapons. Dozens of battle-scarred ships are parked in the hangars here, a stark contrast to the ports in the more peaceful regions of the Wanderer territory.`

Aside from the drilling companies and refineries, the largest local employer is the local government's safety oversight department, whose inspectors are constantly visiting the drilling platforms and shipping hubs to ensure that all the regulations for preventing oil spills are being followed.`
	spaceport `Plastics and other refined oil products are as essential to Wanderer technology as to humans, but it is clear that those responsible for harvesting them are not held in high regard. The crews of visiting ships seem eager to interact with the locals as little as possible. However, that does not appear to stop the Wanderer freighters from purchasing large shipments of plastic, which will no doubt yield a substantial profit elsewhere in Wanderer space.`

Most of the factories that remain active have been repurposed to produce weapons or ammunition for the defense of Wanderer space.`
	spaceport `Very few Wanderer children are present in the spaceport. Most of the inhabitants still live far above the ground in the customary Wanderer tree-houses, but that portion of the village is dwarfed by the more recently constructed factories and warehouses for war supplies.

	description `This Wanderer world is almost uninhabited and devoid of any indigenous ecosystem, except perhaps on the microscopic level. It has none of the beauty of other Wanderer settlements. Here, factories have been built to process the most dangerous and destructive of industrial chemicals. If disaster strikes one of the factories, the only result will be the contamination of a world that is already dead and lifeless - far better, in the judgment of the Wanderers, than allowing such risky industries to operate on a living world.`
	spaceport `Nearly all the operations of the factories here are automated, and the outside atmosphere is too thin for even the Wanderers to breathe. The workers live in dormitory apartments in a ring surrounding a large central dome. Inside the dome, protected from the elements, is a park whose gardens contain everything from towering conifers to fields of wildflowers; a necessary place of sanctuary and rest for the Wanderers who must spend the rest of their time servicing machines in the bleak environment outside the spaceport.`

	spaceport `It is easy to distinguish the local workers from the visitors, because the locals wrap their wings in thin white sheets of cloth rather than leaving them bare: a necessary protection for any Wanderer who chooses to fly outside of the protective shade of the spaceport. Many of the buildings here extend deep underground, to where the surrounding bedrock is cooler than the hot sands at the surface.`

	description `Due to strong currents and extreme seasonal temperature fluctuations, the oceans of Vibrant Water are dotted with icebergs that can drift almost as far as the tropics before melting. The largest icebergs are more than a dozen kilometers across and are home to entire ecosystems ranging from ice-dwelling insects to sea birds to large seal-like mammals. Beneath the ocean surface shoals of fish, forests of kelp, and drifting clouds of algae provide a continuous food source for the creatures that inhabit the icebergs.`
	description `	Near the equator, the Saryds farm several species of engineered algae.`
	spaceport `Very little of the industry on Vibrant Water takes place on land. The spaceport is built on a high bluff overlooking the sea, frequently visited by barges carrying goods from the floating factories and refineries out in the midst of the algae farms. Surrounding the port are fields of wind turbines positioned to catch the ocean breeze.`

Today the main reason for the continuing Remnant presence here is that this is the only world they have found where the "key stones" that enable ships to travel through certain wormholes in the Ember Waste can be found.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is an enormous dome, built of the same resilient and semi-organic material as the hulls of Remnant ships. An opening at one end of the dome allows ships to fly in and out. Inside, the air is still cold, but at least you are sheltered from the violent winds that sweep across the rest of the planet's surface. Some of the locals, accustomed to the cold, walk about in their shirtsleeves as if this were a balmy summer day.`

	description `	In recent years, both the land and the seas of Warfeed have begun to show the toll of centuries of overharvesting. Large portions of the continents near the equator are now nothing but growing deserts, and even the best remaining farmland is sandy and nutrient-poor. All but the smallest marine organisms have been nearly fished to extinction.`
	spaceport `This spaceport is a collection of ramshackle wooden buildings and packed dirt landing pads.

The trees have evolved deep and strong roots that can pierce through the limestone into the subterranean rivers in order to draw a constant supply of water even in the dry seasons. The Saryds have explored only a tiny fraction of the caves.`
	spaceport `The spaceport village is built on a volcanic highland where the inhabitants do not need to worry about their houses disappearing overnight into one of the limestone sinkholes that pockmark this planet's tropics.

The planet was not settled until about a century ago, when a group of investors from Pherkad decided to build a manufacturing center here, rather than trying to find more land on the already overcrowded planet of Solace. Claiming that the industrial emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases would eventually warm the planet and turn it into a tropical paradise, they were able to draw enough settlers to keep the factories going.`
	description `	The temperatures have risen measurably since the arrival of the human colonists, but without more intentional efforts it may be another century before the planet warms enough to be truly comfortable to live on.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is built on a large rock outcropping, with brilliant blue glaciers flowing to either side down into a lake below. The sight is stunning, and all the more appealing because you are able to view it from behind plate glass windows, in the warmth of the spaceport, rather than in the frigid air outside. Above you, several layers of clouds are scudding across the sky in different directions.`

It has, however, one major advantage as a place to settle: it is far enough away that the Republic makes no attempt to control it.`
	description `	Several villages have been founded near the equator, and in addition there are an unknown number of private holdings, ranging from underground bunkers to enormous cement fortresses. Because the land is owned by no government and anyone can build a dwelling without permission or paperwork as long as they are willing to fight off any other claimants, the total population of Zenith is unknown.`
	spaceport `To create a spaceport for Zenith, one enterprising privateer a few centuries ago used a mixture of explosives and heavy machinery to shift the top of one of the tallest mountains down into the neighboring valleys, creating a high plateau that is (usually) above the fog line. There are landing pads both for starships like yours and for airships that carry cargo to and from the settlements elsewhere on the planet.
