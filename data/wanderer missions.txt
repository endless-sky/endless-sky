			`All the other worlds belonging to this species have appeared unwilling to let you land, but here you find a slightly warmer welcome. A cloud of small, highly maneuverable patrol ships takes off from the planet as you approach and herds you onto one particular landing pad where, after a few minutes, several of the aliens approach your ship.`
			`	This species is birdlike, but with bodies nearly as large as yours, and with wings that tower above you. They come swooping down from the sky, circle your ship to inspect it, and then land near the hatch and wait for you to open it. They do not appear to be armed, but their talons are three or four inches long.`
			`	Hesitantly, you open your hatch and greet them. One of the aliens speaks to you: a chirping, clicking noise. You have no idea what it is saying.`

				`	"Hello. I come in peace."`
				`	"My name is <first>. I am glad to meet you."`
			`	The alien leans forward as you speak, as if trying to decipher your words. "Iyik'ka'ak kareek elik, ek karu karai kavet," it says. You shake your head to indicate that you do not understand, and again try to speak to it in your own language. Again it leans forward as if deeply focused on what you are saying.`
			`	The other aliens standing beside it are inspecting you with equal curiosity. Finally, one of them says to the leader, "Ek kalek kiro suk i'hai, sek speru siyek ka'hai esek'ru fer'ek." The leader gestures in response, turning up open palms, and the second alien steps forward and addresses you in an entirely different language, one that does not sound like birdsong at all. In fact, you suspect that it is the language of a different species entirely, but unfortunately it is no more comprehensible to you than the bird's own language.`
			`	They make some further attempts to communicate with you, but without success. Eventually they give up and all but the leader leaves. The leader makes a sweeping gesture to the rest of the spaceport, apparently inviting you to explore.`

			`As before, you are ushered to the ground by a flock of the small alien ships, and a few of them fly over to your ship and wait for your to come out and try to talk to them. Also as before, you do not recognize their language and they do not understand yours, although their leader seem to be focused intently on trying to understand you.`

The leader gestures in response, turning up open palms, and the second alien steps forward and begins speaking in an entirely different language. After a moment, you are startled to realize that it is speaking the language of the Hai.`
			`	"Hai, You speak the Hai language?" you ask. You cup your hands above your ears to mimic the large, rodent-like ears of the Hai.`
			`	"Iy, ka'hai!" says the alien, rustling its wings in what you take as a gesture of excitement, "Speru ek ka'hai?" At the same time, though, one of the other aliens takes a step back and flexes its talons at you. It occurs to you that the Hai may or may not be viewed favorably here.`

				`	"Sorry, I don't speak their language."`
				`	"Are there any Hai here?"`
			`	The same alien speaks again, pantomiming your ship flying into the sky and then returning, and then points to your airlock and mimics your rodent-ear gesture for the Hai. You think it is telling you to go find one of the Hai who can serve as an interpreter, and bring them back here.`
