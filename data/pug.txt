Aside from some dull blue-grey moss and lichen, there are few living things here. The ground is warmer than the air above it, due to an abundance of radioactive elements in the planet's crust.`

The landing pads are not cement or any other material humans customarily use, but monolithic slabs of basalt. One of the fuel tanks has a human-style connector on it, but there are a dozen other connectors branching off from it as well.`

			`You scan this planet's surface and pick up only a single, faint energy source. Cautiously, you approach it, and find an abandoned fueling depot: a ring of landing pads around a cluster of tanks of all different shapes and sizes. Some of the tanks must be cryogenic, because they are covered in ice. A few slow-moving insectoid robots are busy clearing off the ice and cleaning the tanks, but they do not appear to be armed and you see no sign of any other creatures or of any defense systems.`
			`	You land your ship. Your sensors say the air is safe to breathe, but you wear a respirator just in case as you step off your ship and explore the depot. The spider robots pay no attention to you. From the fact that some of the tanks are covered in frost and others are not, you would guess that each one contains a different fuel, and each tank has dozens of different connectors branching off from it. With surprise, you discover that one of those connectors is the style used in human space, and you are able to use it to refuel your ship.`
			`	Other than the robots and the fog swirling in the valley below you, there is no sign of life or motion here, and the air is uncomfortably moist and cold despite the hot steam rising up from a few nearby vents in the ground.`

			`	The moment you reach for your gun, one of the armed Pug fires a burst of light from its staff, and a warm, pleasant feeling washes over you - the most wonderful feeling you have ever experienced. In a daze, you begin to wander back to your ship, stopping occasionally to marvel at the things around you that you had not noticed before: the glittering of sunlight on the water, the sparkling drops of ocean spray hanging from the tips of sea marsh grass, the sky that has the bluest blueness of all the blues you have ever seen. It is all so beautiful that you start to cry. Once you reach your ship, you sit in the cockpit fascinated by the blinking lights on the control panel and unable to remember what any of them are for.`
			`	A few hours later, the wonderful feeling is replaced by a wave of nausea and a pounding headache.`
