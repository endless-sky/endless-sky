	description `This is a stormy, cloud-covered planet, where fog banks flow through the valleys like dark, cold, slow-moving rivers, and the sun is seldom visible. Aside from some dull blue-grey moss and lichen, there are few living things here. The ground is warmer than the air above it, due to an abundance of radioactive elements in the planet's crust.`
	description `	Most of the surface is ocean, but atop one of the higher mountains is an odd, abandoned spaceport.`
	spaceport `Perhaps the oddest thing about this planet is this spaceport: a ring of landing pads surrounding a collection of fuel tanks. The landing pads are not cement or any other material humans customarily use, but monolithic slabs of basalt. One of the fuel tanks has a human-style connector on it, but there are a dozen other connectors branching off from it as well.`
	spaceport `	A few insectoid robots scuttle slowly across the tanks and landing pads, removing ice and rust and lichen and polishing the surfaces of the tanks. No living creatures are present.`

			`You scan this planet's surface and pick up only a single, faint energy source. Cautiously, you approach it, and find an abandoned fueling depot: a ring of landing pads around a cluster of tanks of all different shapes and sizes. Some of the tanks must be cryogenic, because they are covered in ice. A few slow-moving insectoid robots are busy clearing off the ice and cleaning the tanks, but they do not appear to be armed and you see no sign of any other creatures or of any defense systems.`
			`	You land your ship. Your sensors say the air is safe to breathe, but you wear a respirator just in case as you step off your ship and explore the depot. The spider robots pay no attention to you. From the fact that some of the tanks are covered in frost and others are not, you would guess that each one contains a different fuel, and each tank has dozens of different connectors branching off from it. With surprise, you discover that one of those connectors is the style used in human space, and you are able to use it to refuel your ship.`
			`	Other than the robots and the fog swirling in the valley below you, there is no sign of life or motion here, and the air is uncomfortably moist and cold despite the hot steam rising up from a few nearby vents in the ground.`
