	description "It is unclear what these creatures are, where they come from, or how they evolved. Scientists have dissected several, but so far the results have simply been that these creatures contain no materials or resources of value; are not even slightly edible, and are too big to be kept as pets."
	description "	To date, none have demonstrated any sign of sapience, and the few captains who have seen them basically consider them to be the bison of space."
