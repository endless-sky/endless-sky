	description "It is unclear what these creatures are, where they come from, or how they evolved. Scientists have dissected several, but so far the results have simply been that these creatures contain no materials or resources of value; are not even slightly edible, and are too big to be kept as pets."
	description "	To date, none have demonstrated any sign of sapience, and the few captains who have seen them basically consider them to be the bison of space."

	description "This unusual creature, first spotted in Postverta, seems to have an affinity for void sprites and is usually found close to them. This 'Ember Waste Node,' as it is being called, bears a superficial resemblance to void sprites but is clearly a different species. The Node demonstrates an ability to manipulate energy fields to create shield-like structures around itself. Most remarkably, it has been seen appearing and disappearing with an energy signature reminiscent of jump drives."
	description "Although the Node's cloaking power is believed to be connected to its other energy manipulation abilities, the exact method is unknown."
