From the perspective of someone who values economic growth above all else, war was a better alternative than recession."`

He invites all of you to join him for dinner at his home, which turns out to be an apartment on the twenty-third floor of one of the downtown skyscrapers. There, he introduces you to several other regional governors and authorities.`

Indeed, during some of the darkest centuries of the space age, the Deep stood out as a beacon of civilization, a place where piracy was not tolerated and all travelers were safe. When we joined the Republic, we retained the authority to police our own territory, and that authority includes the right to track down fugitives who have fled beyond our usual jurisdiction."`

			label police
			`	"We want to see justice done," says Edrick. "Our proposal is that a fleet under our jurisdiction, but joined by Free Worlds and Oathkeeper vessels, will travel into the Core and arrest at least one of the Syndicate masterminds behind the terrorist attacks. Such an action would satisfy the technical requirements of legality provided that immediately prior to the arrest, one of our courts hears Sawyer's testimony and pronounces that Syndicate individual guilty."`

			`	Ijs laughs at that. "Relax, Captain. I've been doing 'technically legal' stuff for years. It only occasionally goes disastrously wrong. But governor, if the Syndicate sees you coming, you'll need a full-scale war fleet, not just a handful of ships."`
			label travel
			`	"That's why the fleet will be composed of ships from three different organizations," says Edrick. "You will find a reason to travel to Earth with perhaps one of your fancy new Dreadnoughts as an escort. When you arrive, there will just happen to be an Oathkeeper patrol passing through the same system. And a merchant convoy from the Deep. With its own set of escorts, of course."`
			`	"We'd need to know exactly where and on what planet our target lives, prior to entering Syndicate space," says Katya. "And, if you want to have a court trial immediately prior to the arrest, it sounds like Sawyer will need to stay here."`
			`	"Indeed," says Edrick, "but I assure you, he is safer from the Syndicate here than anywhere else in human space, your own territory included. As for locating a target, that's why the Oathkeepers have requested that you visit them on Farpoint."`
			`	The rest of the evening is a more casual time for conversation, with plenty of good food and wine. At one point, Edrick pulls you aside and says, "I've requested that you be granted access to some of the new technology that was developed here during the course of the war. In particular, please find space on your ship for a ramscoop; you will need it for your next mission. And also, here." He hands you a data card.

"Okay, okay, I admit, we've been making one bad decision after another ever since... well, since that first bad decision. It just got out of control. We thought the Navy was going to raid us and put us all behind bars. We thought we needed a deterrent. It was stupid. I admit it, okay? Now please, let's just move on.

If you are, we will work together until this threat is dealt with... and once it is dealt with, we will return our attention to bringing every member of the Syndicate who had a hand in those terrorist attacks to justice. That is our best and final offer." You nod in agreement.`
			`	It's clear that Alastair is none too happy about that deal, but he accepts it. "The jump drives are all being kept on Hephaestus," he says.

If they want war, you must play their game, and if you play their game, they may allow you to win."`

As you may know, business is all about taking risks, for uncertain payoffs. But the Oracle gave us a way to predict the future, for everything from supply chain management to stock trading to the commodities market."`

A massive recession was coming, an end to the golden days of the Republic. We tried altering the model in every way we could: changing our production, our wages. We even asked the Oracle if dissolving the Syndicate would avert the recession. But its predictions remained the same. Then we learned from our contacts in Parliament about the Southern Defense Pact, and the fear that they were about to declare independence. So we asked the Oracle what would happen if war broke out."`
			`	"You started a war... to save the economy?" says Danforth. He sounds disgusted.`

			choice

			`	"We gave the Alphas most of the alien technology we recovered," he says, "but one device, we managed to keep secret from them. We found it in a Korath cargo hold, and it took us a long time to even figure out how to activate it. But when we did, we discovered that it's a cloaking device. It obscures a ship not just from the visible spectrum, but from radar as well, and every other sensor we've tested except for gravitational ones. I'm certain it would hide you from the tracking systems on the nukes."`
			`	Freya says, "But it would only hide one ship. That doesn't sound like it would do much good."`
			`	Alastair says, "They have a limited number of nukes. Our plan was to send a ship in cloaked, have it uncloak long enough to draw their fire, and then cloak to avoid the missiles. Basically, see how many missiles we can get them to spend before the main attack fleet arrives."`
			`	Danforth says, "That's not a bad idea. Captain <last>, would you be willing to serve as the decoy?"`

				`	"It sounds risky, but I'll do it."`
					goto end
