JJ explains that Albatross started out as a sort of farming commune: independent, but not associated with any illegal activity. But they were dominated by pirates, and since then, one pirate overlord after another has held sway over the planet. So in principle at least, the locals ought to welcome the idea of Free Worlds protection.`

			`	"Our fleet is there?" asks JJ.`

They do not know where the defector landed, but they say they will destroy whatever settlement is harboring him unless he is returned to them immediately."`
			`	After a moment, JJ says, "If these allegations are true, if we can prove that the Free Worlds was innocent of any involvement in those attacks, the Republic might make peace with us, or at least agree to a ceasefire. I vote that we try to shelter this defector and hear his story."`
			`	"And if it's a lie," says Freya, "and we refuse the Syndicate's demands, we lose our only ally. And many civilians will be killed, as well. I care about justice, but trading a definite ally for a slim possibility of peace: that is an unwise investment. I vote that we hand this man over to the Syndicate."`

			`	As you wait for them to approach, JJ receives a message from one of the militia crews. "Sir, you have incoming! A scout ship, with Republic markings. Apparently unarmed. Shall we intercept them?"`
			`	"Oathkeepers?" asks JJ. "Or ordinary Navy? Who are they?"`
			`	The voice on the other end pauses. "Neither. Navy Intelligence."`
			`	JJ thinks about that for a second, then says, "Let them land. But follow them down, and if you see so much as a hint of them powering up weapons, blow them out of the sky. Understand?" The officer acknowledges his order and signs off.`
			`	As the group of monks approaches from the mountainside, the scout ship comes in for a landing and skids to a halt in the dirt a few dozen meters away. A woman steps off it. She has dark skin, and is dressed entirely in black. Even the whites of her eyes are black: when she gets closer, you can see that it is actually a scleric tattoo, an intricate Celtic knotwork pattern inked into the whites of her eyes. She sees you staring at her, and winks at you with a friendly grin.`

			`	She frowns. "My name is Raven," she says. "I am here to question this defector. If you are interested in knowing the truth, you will allow me to do so."`

				`	"No, we insist on being present for your interrogation."`
					goto present
				`	"Very well, we'll wait outside."`
			`	"No!" says JJ. "We're staying here."`

			`	She hesitates for a long moment. This is probably going against whatever orders she is following. But finally she says, "Very well." The monks step aside. She approaches the defector, and reaches out her hands to him. Hesitantly, he takes her hands. It's an oddly intimate scene, the two of them quietly holding hands and locking eyes - not like any interrogation you have seen before. "Now," she says, "tell me your story."`
			`	"My name is Sawyer," says the man. "I'm a physicist, a Syndicate employee. We had a secret project on Mutiny, a planet in a pirate system. We were developing nuclear weapons." He hesitates, and looks away for a second, then says, "They told me it was for fighting the pirates. I didn't realize otherwise until--"`
			`	"That is a lie," says Raven, calmly.`
			`	He seems flustered. "Okay, they didn't tell me what the weapons were for, and I didn't ask."`
			choice
				`	"Why would the Syndicate attack the Republic?"`
				`	"Why did you wait so long to report this?"`
					goto wait
			`	They both seem surprised at you asking a question. "I'm not sure," says Sawyer, "but the Syndicate's profits have more than doubled since this war began. Maybe they knew they would benefit from it more than anyone."`
			`	"What led you to report this?" asks Raven.`
			label wait
			`	He says, "It was when I heard that there had been another major battle. Up until then I had been telling myself that the worst of the damage was done. But after that battle, I knew that millions more could die because of our crime, and that I had the power to stop it."`
			`	Raven continues to ask questions: who was involved, how the facility was hidden, where the raw materials come from. At one point, JJ pulls you aside and says, "She must be a Questioner. How they operate is a tightly kept secret. I'd always assumed their methods were... a bit more medieval."`
			`	Finally, Raven is satisfied, and radios her ship. "He's telling the truth," she tells them. "Send word to the generals at once. And, release the captive."`
			`	The door of her ship slides open, and another woman steps out - shakily, hesitantly, shielding her eyes against the sunlight. It takes you a few seconds to realize that it's Katya.`
			`	As you all rush over to greet Katya, Raven taps your shoulder and says quietly, "Meet me in the main spaceport in a few hours and we'll figure out what's going to happen next." She returns to her ship.`
