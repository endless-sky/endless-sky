			`The Wanderers here seem incredulous that they managed to drive off such a powerful Unfettered attack force. As you walk through the spaceport, many of them stop to thank you for your assistance in defending their home.`
			`	Just as you reach the pavilion where the military leaders are gathering, a shadow falls over you, and you look up to see two ships approaching with the unmistakable horned silhouettes of Pug warships. Throughout the spaceport you hear Wanderer voices raised in excitement, and hundreds of them leap into the air to accompany the Pug ships to the landing pad. Sobari Tele'ek says to you, "It is a [visitation, appearance] of the Keepers! In our hour of [need, desperation] they make themselves known at last." A small delegation of Pug disembarks from the ships and approaches the pavilion on foot.`
			choice
				`	"Let's hope that they offer you more help than they did last time I talked with them."`
				`	"The Pug are dangerous and unpredictable. You should not trust them."`
				`	"If they really cared about you, they would have intervened before so many of you died fighting the Unfettered."`
			`	"The Keepers are [subtle, mysterious]," says Tele'ek, "but always their [intervention, action] has been for our [benefit, good]. Now be silent, and allow them to speak."`
			`	The Pug delegation reaches the pavilion, and one of them begins speaking in the Wanderer language. You have no idea what they are saying, and they all seem to be ignoring your presence. A few of the Wanderer leaders respond. There's an awful lot of fanning of wings, flipping of tails, and preening of feathers going on. That might be the Wanderer way of trying to make a good impression, or else they're just feeling pleased with themselves. Or maybe they're nervous; it's hard to tell.`
			`	The Pug finish their conversation with the Wanderers and return to their ships, and only then does Sobari Tele'ek turn to you and say, "Great news! They say that their two ships will [patrol, remain in] this system and [hold off, hold at bay] the Hai fleets. Also," he adds, preening himself, "they are very pleased with us for [growing, becoming] so strong. And, they say we need not [fight? worry about?] the Hai anymore."`
			choice
				`	"I've fought Pug ships. There's no way two of them can stand against the entire Unfettered war fleet."`
				`	"Does this mean they're finally willing to open the wormhole for you?"`
					goto eye
			`	"Maybe they have grown stronger, too," says Tele'ek. "In any case, we are [safe, secure] here now, so we do not need your [help, protection]. Perhaps you should return to our capital and see if they need you there."`
				goto end
			label eye
			`	Tele'ek's crest droops a little bit. "I suppose they did not make any [promises, predictions] about that," he says. "But in any case, we are [safe, secure] here now, so we do not need your [help, protection]. Perhaps you should return to our capital and see if they need you there."`
			label end
			choice
				`	"Very well, I'll go check if they need me on <planet>."`
					accept
				`	"You really think that nothing can go wrong here, just because the Pug have arrived?"`
			`	You try to convince Tele'ek that the Pug may not be completely trustworthy, but it's clear you cannot change his mind. To the Wanderers, the Pug must have the status of gods; speaking against them is fruitless. Eventually you give up and agree to go visit <planet>.`

			`A few minutes after you land on <planet>, a sudden uproar passes through the Wanderers in the spaceport. It's hard to be sure, but you think they sound excited, not frightened. Ships start taking off, more and more of them until the spaceport is almost deserted, and no one who is left seems at all interested in talking with you or explaining what is going on. You're probably going to have to return to your ship and see for yourself what all the fuss is about.`
