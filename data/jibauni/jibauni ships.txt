	description "The Quyan is a Jibauni ship with a rich history; it was one of the first ships ever produced by the Jibauni. However, the longevity of its history means that in wartime, the Quyan is a terrible fighter; as such it is used only for hauling passengers, the designers' key priority."

	description "While the Jibauni are not really into interceptors, preferring drones and fighters instead, they have built two, this one a speedy little ship with outsized thrusters. In fact, veteran captains tell new pilots not to get one, for they might run into one of their own missiles. There are no recorded incidents of this happening, but given the size of the Furus's thrusters and the abysmal speed of Rukjay missiles, it could easily happen."

Given that the Furus is faster, however, only the Rebel Jibauni produce and use the Saghir, for its cheapness."
