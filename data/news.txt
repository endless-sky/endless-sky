			"With all these pirate attacks, so many people seem to be arming up and outfitting themselves for war, but I think that's a waste of money. Powerful engines, a scram drive, an afterburner, and some anti-missile defenses are all you need to stay safe."
			"Slow and steady wins the race. Hauling cargo may not be very glamorous, but with a big enough fleet, you can net a million a week."
			"Have you ever done any of those jobs moving black cubes around the Deep? I did that a few times but started to get a really weird vibe, and now I stay away if I can. They're hiding something big up there, and I don't want to have any part in it."
