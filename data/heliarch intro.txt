One or two warehouses have a fair bit of rust on their doors, and just once did you spot one with a damaged roof. You can also make out the shapes of small trees and bushes not too far out.`

Once it does though, it is nearly nightfall, and Kirrie was notified by Iplora that she and Tugroob are already back at the ship, so you two decide to head back too.`

On your way down, suddenly Kirrie yells for you to take cover, and dozens of shots start coming your way. One of the shots hits one of Kirrie's legs before he can take cover.`
			`	You two attempt to retaliate, spotting several small automatic turrets on the ceiling and walls, but their fire proves too much, so you two rush back outside, where Kirrie uses a small radio-like device to call for support. A pair of Heliarch Punishers land nearby shortly after, and you two head back in with dozens of armed agents following.`

			`	They come back, saying the place is deserted, but as you follow them and see that there are many other staircases, probably from other warehouses, you cannot help but wonder if the turrets protecting those staircases can't reach you here.`
			`	The group reaches a massive room with a colossal reactor inside, and Kirrie speaks up, saying, "A Small Reactor Module, it is! Stolen, somehow it was."`
			`	The water pipes continue even to this room, and there reveal their purpose, to serve as a makeshift cooling system for the reactor. The reactor itself generates power to supply several automated production lines, that are replicating many outfits; you even recognize some parts as being awfully similar to that of a few human outfits.`

			`	You can't say much before they've made you get back in your ship. They promise you'll be greatly compensated, and ask that you only disable the ships, boarding them after to see if there are any hostages inside.`

			`	There's something like a round of applause, and some more speeches. After you're brought back to your ship, you're told that the circlet serves as a permission to buy certain outfits, as well as doubling as a translation device.`
