One or two warehouses have a fair bit of rust on their doors, and just once did you spot one with a damaged roof. You can also make out the shapes of small trees and bushes not too far out.`

Once it does, it is nearly nightfall, and Kirrie is notified by Iplora that she and Tugroob are already back at the ship, so you two decide to head back too.`

			`	You two attempt to retaliate, spotting several small automatic turrets on the ceiling and walls, but their fire proves too much, so you rush back outside, where Kirrie uses a small radio-like device to call for support. A pair of Heliarch Punishers land nearby shortly after, and you two head back in with dozens of armed agents following.`

			`	The group reaches a massive room with a colossal reactor inside, and Kirrie speaks up, saying, "A Small Reactor Module, it is! Stolen, somehow it was."`
			`	The water pipes continue to this room, where they serve as a makeshift cooling system for the reactor. The reactor itself generates power to supply several automated production lines, that are replicating many outfits; you even recognize some parts as being awfully similar to those used in a few human outfits.`
