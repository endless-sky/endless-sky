You can also make out the figures of small trees and bushes though, not too far out.`

He asks, showing you some sort of identification card, and explaining that it can open the doors here, but you really make out any differences between any of the many warehouses here.

			`	As you start heading down, you notice that many pipes make their way down too, and you can hear the water from the rain flowing inside. On your way down, suddenly Kirrie yells for you to take cover, and dozens of shots start coming your way. One of the shots hit one of Kirrie's legs before he could take cover.`
			`	You two attempt to retaliate, spotting several small automatic turrets on the ceiling and walls, but their fire proves too much, so you two rush back outside, where Kirrie uses a small radio-like device to call for support. A pair of Heliarch Punishers land nearby shortly after, and you two head back in with dozens of armed agents following.`

			`	The group reaches a massive room with a colossal reactor inside, and Kirrie speaks up, saying, "A Small Reactor Module, it is! Stolen, somehow it was."`
			`	The water pipes continue even to this room, and there reveal their purpose, to serve as a makeshift cooling system for the reactor. The reactor itself generates power to supply several automated production lines, that are replicating many outfits, you even recognize some parts as being awfully similar to that of a few human outfits.`
