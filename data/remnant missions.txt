			`Although they are unusually tall and dark-skinned, the people here appear to be human. You wouldn't know it from the architecture, however: the buildings with their curved, twisted surfaces and ramifying arches look more alien than any human dwelling you have seen before.`
			`	Stranger still, no one is speaking: the usual background murmur of voices that you would associate with a spaceport is absent here. Instead, the locals are communicating in a rapid and graceful sign language, their hands tracing arcs through the air almost faster than your eyes can follow.`
			`	A few of them approach your ship and one of them greets you out loud, but instead of speaking he sings the words in a high, monotone chant: "Do you comprehend the ancestral tongue?"`

A dark, red drop of blood wells up. He presses his finger onto a port on the scanner, then hands you another one of the packets. "We kindly request that you identify yourself," he chants.

			choice
				`	"Of course I'm human. But what are human beings doing out here?"`

			`	Several of them burst into song, singing together in harmony, "We are the hidden ones. We are the Remnant. In time of great chaos to this place we came, lest all true-born humans be killed or enslaved, by those who evolved not, but unwisely were made."`
			`	As they continue to sing, you begin to piece together their story. They are the descendants of people who fled to this region of space through an unstable wormhole at the peak of the first Alpha War, which means they have been here for more than half a millennium. That doesn't explain why their culture is so radically different, though.`
			`	Eventually they invite you to a dinner. Their food has strange and complex flavors, not all of them pleasant, but you do your best to be polite and pretend to enjoy it all. After the meal, they entertain you by singing songs, some of which you recognize as classical Earth music. It appears that people in this culture use sign language for day to day communication, and use their voices only for making music.`

Thus even if someone hacked our networks to give themselves a clean identity, they would still be caught when they started working on a new planet. We also don't broadcast that requirement on our networks, simply enforce it locally. It isn't foolproof, but it adds an additional layer of safety."`

			`	"Hello Captain <last>. My name is Dawn, and I have been spending the past few days skimming the archive you retrieved. I wanted to ask you a few questions. May I?"`
			`	She slides into the chair opposite you without waiting for your reply, and pulls out a datapad. "Firstly, our histories mention how humanity met a race called the 'Quarg' and had some ongoing dialogs with them, but not much beyond that. Now here in this history that you brought us, it says that humanity has started exchanging technology with them! Is this true?" She looks at you intently. You sign negatively, and she dejectedly continues. "Could you explain about them, then?" You reply that the Quarg have allowed humanity to live near them, and that the Quarg are usually willing to answer questions, including scientific ones. You continue, elaborating that while the Quarg don't seem to mind having an innovative shipyard studying them as best it can, they don't actually share their technology with anyone.`

She runs out of the cafeteria after telling you they will meet you at your ship in half an hour.`

While they had each served on Remnant ships exploring the Ember Waste or patrolling their territory, none had ever been more than a handful of jumps away from their own space. They explain that their ships were always cautious to stay far away from human space to avoid leading anyone back.`
			`	It occurs to you that Dawn and her colleagues seem much less reserved than most Remnant. You aren't sure if it is because they are younger, less secretive, or if the Remnant have been holding back from you. It is also possible that you just have better opportunities to figure it out now that you can understand their signs.`
			`	Upon arriving at Wayfarer they spend considerable amount of time watching the few Quarg in evidence, however it is easy to see that the real draw of their attention is the ships. You wave your ID across the scanner for the shipyard and take them inside to see what Tarazed Shipyards has on display.`

That way they can dictate where the fold occurs instead of just aligning with the nearest crease.
