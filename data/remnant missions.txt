Thus even if someone hacked our networks to give themselves a clean identity, they would still be caught the first time they arrived at a new planet.

			`Looking around at the Remnant Spaceport, it suddenly strikes you how amazing this is. You never would have imagined that you would end up here back when you earned your pilot's license. It seems so long ago that your biggest concern was deciding whether to pay off your loan by ferrying cargo, doing courier jobs, or escorting merchants. (and on your darker days - dreaming of becoming a pirate).`
			`	Thinking back, it suddenly occurs to you that you helped retrieve a science drone for some researchers on Bounty - researchers who were studying the wormhole in Terminus. Research like that might be of interest to the Remnant, seeing as it could open the door to research vessels venturing into the Ember Wastes. It would only be a matter of time until someone figures out how to use the key stones - either by luck or by research, and then the Remnant's secrecy would vanish.`

			`	For lack of a better place to go, you stop by the information desk where you picked up the sign language course. You tell the attendant that you have something potentially important - but non-urgent - to discuss in regards to Remnant security. They tap a few buttons, then give you directions down a hallway. You quickly find yourself in an armory where several remnant guards are in the process of cleaning their weapons. One stands up and comes over to you.`
			`	"Greetings Captain, I am prefect Reegar. I was told you had some information that could be important?"`
			`	He takes a seat on a bench a little ways away from the other Remnant, and gestures for you to take a seat with him.`
			`	You give him some background about the current state of Human and Hai understanding about the wormholes - or rather the lack thereof, then explain how you met a team of researchers who were using drones to study the wormhole exit in the Terminus system. He quickly picks up on the potential threat if someone figures out the key to using them, especially since you have demonstrated that it only takes one curious human to figure it out.`
			`	Thinking carefully, he asks "It is clear that we need to keep an eye on this situation. You know more about the rest of the galaxy than we do, could you find them and see how much progress they have made?"`

			` Arriving on Bounty you take a discrete look around the spaceport, but you don't find the researchers or any sign of them. It appears that they packed up and left since the last time you saw them. Time to look around for some info.`

			`A few hours of searching later, you find a lead: It seems that launching probes into the Terminus system isn't exactly a common activity, so their permits stand out from the rest. A helpful clerk in the spaceport office pulled up their application and found that they are listed as part of a university in the Deep, although it doesn't mention which planet their specific campus is on. You pull up a list of Deep worlds and sigh. Looks like you'll have to play tourist for a few weeks.`

			`	Once you've landed on <planet> you look up the local university and pay it a visit. After thinking about it for a minute, you decide that probably the best source of information would be to visit the university library and ask one of the librarians for assistance locating research on wormholes. After some brief research, they return with a handful of research papers published over the past decade. They proudly note that two of the more recent papers were published here in the Deep, and transfer copies of each to you for free.`

			`Back on board the <ship>, you take a moment to flip through the papers.  You quickly realize that little beyond the summary is understandable to someone without a good theoretical understanding of physics. Even with your first-hand experience of wormholes, most of what they are discussing doesn't make much sense.`
			`	All the academic stuff aside, the summary on the most recent paper confirms that the researchers are making progress: They have determined that the spatial anomaly in the Terminus system is in fact a wormhole with some kind of instability. They also speculate that it may be possible for a ship to artificially stabilize the wormhole enough for it to pass through unharmed.`
			`	Prefect Reegar is definitely going to be interested in seeing this.`

			`The trip back to the Ember Wastes is long, and gives you plenty of opportunity to think about what this research could lead to. You also wonder what the Remnant will do, as it seems obvious that their current isolation is about to fail.`
			`	Reegar seems grimly optimistic on receiving your report "If this had happened without us being aware, it could have gone badly. Fortunately for us, you were in the right place at the right time, and have proven yourself loyal to us. So we are now forewarned and can use this time to plan and prepare for it. Perhaps re-establishing contact with the rest of humanity could even be to our benefit, but that will be for the council to decide."`
