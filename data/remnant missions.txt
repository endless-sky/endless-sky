			`Although they are unusually tall and dark-skinned, the people here appear to be human. You wouldn't know it from the architecture, however: the buildings with their curved, twisted surfaces and ramifying arches look more alien than any human dwelling you have seen before.`
			`	Stranger still, no one is speaking: the usual background murmur of voices that you would associate with a spaceport is absent here. Instead, the locals are communicating in a rapid and graceful sign language, their hands tracing arcs through the air almost faster than your eyes can follow.`

			`	Two of them walk up to you. One is carrying a small device that looks like a handheld scanner. The other unwraps a small foil package, pulls out a lancet, and jabs his finger with it. A dark, red drop of blood wells up. He presses his finger onto a port on the scanner, then hands you another one of the packets. "We kindly request that you identify yourself," he chants. Several of the others hum along with him.`

			`	You try to pull away, but the man's hand snakes out and grabs you by the wrist. Before you are even able to react he jabs your finger and shoves it onto the scanner. "You are in our space," he sings. "You will abide by our rules." No longer a monotone, his song is a jarring and atonal melody.`

As you watch them you notice that all of them, even the women, have their hair cropped short. Also, their clothing looks like nothing that has ever been in fashion at any point in human history that you know of.`

			choice
				`	"Of course I'm human. But what are human beings doing out here?"`

			`	Several of them burst into song, singing together in harmony, "We are the hidden ones. We are the Remnant. In time of great chaos to this place we came, lest all true-born humans be killed or enslaved, by those who evolved not, but unwisely were made."`
			`	As they continue to sing, you begin to piece together their story. They are the descendants of people who fled to this region of space through an unstable wormhole at the peak of the first Alpha War, which means they have been here for more than half a millennium. That doesn't explain why their culture is so radically different, though.`
			`	Eventually they invite you to a dinner. Their food has strange and complex flavors, not all of them pleasant, but you do your best to be polite and pretend to enjoy it all. After the meal, they entertain you by singing songs, some of which you recognize as classical Earth music. It appears that people in this culture use sign language for day to day communication, and use their voices only for making music.`

			`As the swirls of gas close over the <ship> you wonder idly what brought you back here. This time, there is no apologetic researcher asking you to risk your life for research, or to return eggs from where they were stolen. You catch a glimpse of the Archon materializing above the clouds as it decloaks, letting you know that you're being watched, but saying nothing; for now, it is nothing more than a silent, brooding presence in the skies of Nenia. The silent depths of an alien world fold over you, gradually erasing the rest of the galaxy from sight.`
			`	As the <ship> levels off at the designated altitude, you strap yourself into a pressure suit. Stepping into the airlock, you grimace at the antiquity of these "hard-shell" shield systems, and lower the shields so that you can exit onto the hull. Out on the surface, you admire the misty kaleidoscope of colors filtering down through the cloud layers, playing over distant shapes moving in the mists.`
			`	Before long several void sprites emerge, weaving and dancing among the clouds. They swirl for a few minutes around your cargo bay doors as if waiting for something, then pulse briefly with flickers of light and drop into the clouds below. Another void sprite flutters around the <ship>, poking at the hull and sliding over it with its tentacles. You quickly think to turn on your video recorder to catch the scene. The void sprite notices your brief movement, and turns towards you with a lunge. As it closes on you, your attention is drawn to what you suspect is its mouth: a zig-zagging crack that peels open like a zipper to reveal an opening that resembles an industrial grinder.`
			`	Up close, the void sprite is massive. Most of its tentacles are easily as thick as your leg, and move with surprising speed and precision. It shifts through the air like a strange deep-sea fish in water. You can make out a low vibration you suspect is from the air whistling over the void sprite as it closes with you. As the giant creature rapidly approaches, you can feel a heavy paralysis weigh down on you. Suddenly, you recall that your shields are keyed to your equipment; you could activate them to protect yourself and they would extend around you. It probably wouldn't be too healthy for the void sprite, though.`

The void sprite is just a few meters away, one tendril reaches out and touches you just as the shield slams into place. The tendril becomes caught on both sides of the shield, cleaving it in two. In the same instant, the pressure on your mind vanishes as if it was simply a dream. You momentarily stare at the immobile void sprite, frozen in shock over what just happened. Then time reasserts itself and the sprite spasms away from the ship with an unearthly crescendo of dissonant tones. It plunges down into the clouds, leaving you standing on your hull with the floating severed piece of tendril.`
			`	You carefully scoop up the tendril in a container and seal it. While the attack spoiled the beautiful moment, at least you have a sample and some recordings that might be of interest to Plume.`

			label holdground
			`	The feeling of paralysis leaves your body as the void sprite is only a few meters away, but you resolve yourself to face down the creature without triggering your shields. Time seems to slow down as the sprite rushes up to you and its leading tentacle reaches out to touch you. As you brace for an impact you realize that the sprite has managed to bring itself to a complete stop and the tentacle has telescoped in on itself slightly. You can see that it is touching you, but you didn't even feel the impact. You and the void sprite stand frozen for a moment, and the force trying to paralyze you snaps off, replaced by a feeling of weightlessness. Moments later the void sprite pulls back and pulses skyward with an unearthly fountain of sounds, spiraling around the <ship> before disappearing into the swirling clouds.`
			`	As you re-enter the ship, you notice that your suit is covered in some kind of translucent slime. You scrape off as much as you can into a sealed container, but your pressure suit appears to be permanently stained an iridescent purplish color as a result.
