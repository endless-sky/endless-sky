	`The bank's architecture is what you would have called "futuristic" back when you dreamed that the future would be less squalid than the present: story above story of curves and spires and balconies, all in gleaming metal. A doorman stands by each of the heavy glass doors. You are wearing your very best clothes, but you feel shabby next to them.`
	`	The loan broker's office is equally intimidating. Large computer monitors fill the walls, with stock quotes and other information spilling down them almost too fast to read. You occasionally glimpse the names of places that you have only seen in movies: Aldebaran. Tarazed. Earth.`
	`	The pen is heavy as lead but glides almost without friction as you print your initials on the bottom of page after page of ominous legal documents and sign several dozen statements, notices, and agreements. The banker, a balding middle-aged man in a suit that you suspect costs more than the spaceship you are about to purchase, flips the pages past you quickly, uttering a curt, "Sign here. Now here," as he points to each page. He moves swiftly, mechanically.`
	`	The only moment when he becomes truly animated is when explaining the Truth in Lending statement to you. "You are borrowing 480,000 credits," he says, "to be repaid over the course of one year. Your daily interest rate is 0.4%, which means that your daily payments are 2,503 credits, and by the end of the year you will have paid... 433,567 credits in interest. Sign here." He grins.`

	`	Compared to the bank, you feel much more at home in the shipyard, walking among the rusted out hulks and newer ships that gleam in the sunlight. You smell grease and dirt and rocket fuel; wonderful smells. There are three ship models within your price range. Which one you choose will determine your future...`

Several seats forward, a young couple close to your age discuss the down payment on an apartment as their legs kick their luggages. Behind you is the only other person in the car; a much older man wearing greasy overalls, who you assume comes from off-world by how his hair has turned gray.`
	`	Before long, you arrive in New Reykjavik and find the government office responsible for handling starship loans. The place is relatively empty compared to the photos you'd seen online a week prior; most applicants have already been processed in the week after exam results were posted. The only people left are those sick at the time, those too lazy to apply in a timely manner, and those willing to wait if it means avoiding a mosh pit of students in a government building. You hand over your application papers, and after verifying them against online records, the office worker hands you two cards. One of them is the card for applying for a loan at a nearby bank; the other is your pilot's license, fully paid for.`
	`	The bank is only a few blocks away from the office. You insert the card into an automatic clerk, and after a soft ping, a large document fills its screen.`

	`	Eager to get started, you rush out of the bank, hop on the metro, and head towards the shipyard. You can barely keep your face straight as the rest of the carriage wear blank expressions. After getting off, you consider throwing away your planetary transport pass, but decide against it.`
	`	You had seen videos of the shipyard in New Reykjavik, but visiting the site in person blows your wildest dreams out of the water. Throughout the gleaming-white facility, salespeople show of a variety of holographically-rendered vessels to sharply-dressed clients, while skyscraper-sized ships loom silently in the background. Although most of the ships are far outside of your price range, you spot a few that you'll be able to purchase. Which one you choose will determine your future...`

	`Delve is unlike any planet you've ever been on: the entire spaceport is buried into a mountain, with one side open to receive incoming ships. The hallways leading from the hangars to the port proper are cramped, dirty, and covered in machinery, creating a sense of claustrophobia far different from the packed cities of Earth.`
	`	You hand the last of your credits to the captain that brought you here. Before she leaves, she gives you some advice. "Just a heads up: if you don't feel like dying early, head north after launching. South of here is nothing but uninhabited systems and pirates. You wouldn't last long in whatever ship you're going to buy." You thank her for the ride and for the advice and part ways.`
	`	You stop by the shipyard first to see what they have. You're noticed by a salesman who seems to reluctantly approach you, perhaps due to the fact that your clothes are rather shabby compared to those around you. You ask him what it would take to purchase a ship here. He mentions the neccessity of a pilot's license before beginning his spiel about all the cheapest models, but you cut him short and say that's all you needed.`

You say how you're in need of a loan to buy a starship; 630,000 credits should be enough to cover the cost of the license and the ship. After handing over your Syndicate Account information, the teller comes back with a piece of paper. This whole process seems suspiciously streamlined to you.`
	`	"Lucky for you the interest rates are great right now!" You take a glance at the paper and feel a sense of dread fall over you. The daily interest rate is 0.5%, meaning the daily payments are 3,162 credits for a whole year. If you don't pay off any of your loan early, you'll have paid a disgusting 624,205 credits in interest. "Just sign here." The teller grins.`

	`	After leaving the bank, you spend an hour waiting in line to apply for a pilot's license. When you finish going through the oddly easy process of applying for a license, you're left with 480,000 credits. You can't help but get the feeling that you're being played by the Syndicate once again in all this.`
	`	You return to the shipyard, this time with a credit chip in your hand to draw the attention of the salesman. "Welcome back! I hope we can find you the perfect model," he says. The shipyard is full of ships that you can't buy, but the salesman finds three models within your price range: an interceptor, a light freighter, and a transport ship. Which one you choose will determine your future...`
