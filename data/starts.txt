	`The bank's architecture is what you would have called "futuristic" back when you dreamed that the future would be less squalid than the present: story above story of curves and spires and balconies, all in gleaming metal. A doorman stands by each of the heavy glass doors. You are wearing your very best clothes, but you feel shabby next to them.`
	`	The loan broker's office is equally intimidating. Large computer monitors fill the walls, with stock quotes and other information spilling down them almost too fast to read. You occasionally glimpse the names of places that you have only seen in movies: Aldebaran. Tarazed. Earth.`
	`	The pen is heavy as lead but glides almost without friction as you print your initials on the bottom of page after page of ominous legal documents and sign several dozen statements, notices, and agreements. The banker, a balding middle-aged man in a suit that you suspect costs more than the spaceship you are about to purchase, flips the pages past you quickly, uttering a curt, "Sign here. Now here," as he points to each page. He moves swiftly, mechanically.`
	`	The only moment when he becomes truly animated is when explaining the Truth in Lending statement to you. "You are borrowing 480,000 credits," he says, "to be repaid over the course of one year. Your daily interest rate is 0.4%, which means that your daily payments are 2,503 credits, and by the end of the year you will have paid... 433,567 credits in interest. Sign here." He grins.`

	`	Compared to the bank, you feel much more at home in the shipyard, walking among the rusted out hulks and newer ships that gleam in the sunlight. You smell grease and dirt and rocket fuel; wonderful smells. There are three ship models within your price range. Which one you choose will determine your future...`

The only people left are those who were too sick or lazy to come by last week, as well as those wishing to avoid a mosh pit of students in a government building. You hand over your application, and after verifying them against online records, the office worker hands you two cards. One of them is your Certificate of Eligibility for a low-interest loan at a nearby bank; the other is your pilot's license, paid in full.`

	`	You had seen videos of the shipyard in New Reykjavik, but visiting the site in person blows your wildest dreams out of the water. Throughout the gleaming-white facility, salespeople show of a variety of holographically-rendered vessels to sharply-dressed clients, while skyscraper-sized ships loom silently in the background.

	`Delve is unlike any planet you've ever been on: the entire spaceport is built into a colossal mountain cave, with one side exposed to the open air. The beams and buildings that make up the port dwarf the pitiful structures of Antipode, yet still feel completely different from the crushing urban landscapes of Earth.`
	`	You hand the last of your credits to the captain that brought you here. Before she leaves, she gives you some advice. "Just a heads up: if you don't feel like dying early, head north after launching. South of here is nothing but uninhabited systems and pirates. You wouldn't last long in any ship you could afford." You thank her for the ride and advice before parting ways.`
	`	You stop by the shipyard first to see what they have. You're noticed by a salesman who seems reluctant to approach you, perhaps due to the fact that your clothes are rather shabby compared to those around you. You ask him what it would take to purchase a ship here. He mentions the necessity of a pilot's license before beginning his spiel about all the cheapest models, but you cut him short and say that's all you needed.`

You say how you're in need of a loan to buy a starship; 530,000 credits should be enough to cover the cost of the license and the ship. After handing over your Syndicate Account information, the teller comes back with a piece of paper. This whole process seems suspiciously streamlined to you.`
	`	"Lucky for you, the interest rates are great right now!" You take a glance at the paper and feel a sense of dread fall over you. The daily interest rate is 0.5%, meaning the daily payments are 3,162 credits for a whole year. If you don't pay off any of your loan early, you'll have paid a disgusting 624,205 credits in interest. "Just sign here." The teller grins.`

	`	After leaving the bank, you spend an hour waiting in line to apply for a pilot's license. The process is oddly simple, and by the time it's done, you're left with 480,000 credits. You can't shake the feeling that the Syndicate is playing you again.`
	`	You return to the shipyard, this time with a credit chip in your hand to draw the attention of the salesman. "Welcome back! I hope we can find you the perfect model," he says. The shipyard is full of ships that you can't buy, but the salesman finds three models within your price range: an interceptor, a light freighter, and a transport ship. Which one you choose will determine your future...`
