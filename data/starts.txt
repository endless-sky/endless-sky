	description `You grew up on New Boston, an uninteresting world in the Dirt Belt. You've dreamed of owning a starship ever since your first visit to the spaceport at the age of fifteen. After many long years of working at a textile mill, you've finally saved enough credits to apply for a pilot's license from the Republic.`
	description `	After receiving the license and with freedom from this planet at your fingertips, you travel to the bank to take out a loan on your first ship...`

	`The bank's architecture is what you would have called "futuristic" back when you dreamed that the future would be less squalid than the present: story above story of curves and spires and balconies, all in gleaming metal. A doorman stands by each of the heavy glass doors. You are wearing your very best clothes, but you feel shabby next to them.`
	`	The loan broker's office is equally intimidating. Large computer monitors fill the walls, with stock quotes and other information spilling down them almost too fast to read. You occasionally glimpse the names of places that you have only seen in movies: Aldebaran. Tarazed. Earth.`
	`	The pen is heavy as lead but glides almost without friction as you print your initials on the bottom of page after page of ominous legal documents and sign several dozen statements, notices, and agreements. The banker, a balding middle-aged man in a suit that you suspect costs more than the spaceship you are about to purchase, flips the pages past you quickly, uttering a curt, "Sign here. Now here," as he points to each page. He moves swiftly, mechanically.`
	`	The only moment when he becomes truly animated is when explaining the Truth in Lending statement to you. "You are borrowing 480,000 credits," he says, "to be repaid over the course of one year. Your daily interest rate is 0.4%, which means that your daily payments are 2,503 credits, and by the end of the year you will have paid... 433,567 credits in interest. Sign here." He grins.`
	`	You sign your name one final time:`
	name
	`	The elevator is so well-tuned that you do not even realize it is moving until it has deposited you back in the lobby. But as you leave the bank, you are smiling. This crazy adventure suddenly feels real to you. You are going to do it. You are finally going to get off this planet.`
	`	Compared to the bank, you feel much more at home in the shipyard, walking among the rusted out hulks and newer ships that gleam in the sunlight. You smell grease and dirt and rocket fuel; wonderful smells. There are three ship models within your price range. Which one you choose will determine your future...`

conversation "hai intro"
	scene "scene/hai shipyard"
	`	You've never been to the shipyard before, and going to the poles already feels like you're traveling to another world. The pictures and videos you've seen of all these ships before simply don't do them justice; seeing them for real is something else entirely. Even though you know a lot of those ships must have been in service for many years, you are stunned by how new and shiny they look. You begin to wonder if you are ready to take the big leap.`
	`	This "Aphid" could suit your needs. It is fast and able to carry a respectable amount of cargo.`
	scene "thumbnail/hai aphid"
	`	That is, unless you want to get adventurous and try out the impetuous Grasshopper. Surely the interceptor would be able to beat the smaller human warships, provided a competent pilot is at the helm.`
	`	You have, after all, heard tales of pirates and quick money from the many newcomers. Thanks to the installation of Mountaintop, they say, the way to human space is much safer than it used to be. What happened with the Pug is not clear, however.`
	`	Alternatively, up north you can find the 'Unfettered'. Maybe they would come to like you, if you were to show them the strength and cunning they respect.`
	choice
		`	(Go to the bank.)`
	scene "scene/hai bank"
	`	You head to the bank's lobby, hoping to get enough of a loan to be able to buy one of these pristine ships.`
	`	To your disappointment, the only ship you could afford is an Aphid. You arrange the contract to loan as much money as you need in order to buy one, in what has to be the first seriously unwise act of your life.`
	`	You've heard of new captains stripping down their ships to recoup the initial buy-in, which is crossing your mind at seeing the financial burden you're about to take on. While waiting for paperwork to be processed, you scan over an Aphid pamphlet in the office. The pricey shield regenerator could be traded in if dangerous areas are avoided... and perhaps even the anti-missile system could be downgraded or outright removed... one of the Sand Cells could be sold back to make more space for cargo...`
	`	Those anxious musings are interrupted when the bank employee finally lays it out to you, with a hesitant smile. "This will put you in a debt of 1.431 million credits, due in the course of 2 years, with an interest rate of 0.3% per day. Please sign here."`
	name
	`	You head out of the bank, but on your way to buy the Aphid at the shipyard, you see a notice. A retiring captain is offering to sell some of his ships at an interesting price, including a Grasshopper... Maybe they could sell it to you.`
	choice
		`	(Go to the shipyard.)`
			decline
		`	(Go see what the captain has to offer first.)`
	`	You head to the spaceport and easily find the captain selling off his ships. Thankfully they did not yet sell the Grasshopper.`
	`	The captain greets you in Hai. You are embarrassed to have to explain to them that you never learned their language. Most Hai speak your language however, and, as usual, they are able to switch to speaking yours without much difficulty.`
	`	"Hello, good fellow! I assume you come for the Grasshopper." Your interest for this ship must be apparent.`
	choice
		`	"Yes indeed."`
		`	"How did you know?"`
		`	"Sorry, not interested."`
			decline
	`	"I can see the will to explore in your eyes, but it is not only that: I know that some humans want to head back to their space, now that it is safer to do so. I would be delighted to have you flying the 'Pristine Jewel'!" they say, taking you to the ship. It is clearly not brand new, but is still in a surprisingly good condition.`
	scene "thumbnail/hai grasshopper"
	`	"Because I like you I'll give you a friendly price. What do you say about... a bit over a million credits, for this wonderful ship? That's less than a third the price you would have to pay if you were to buy this model from the shipyard. Except you can't find a model like this in shipyards, trust me!"`
	choice
		`	"Sold!"`
		`	"Sorry, not interested."`
			decline
	`	As the two of you settle up the paperwork, the captain takes the time to explain, in great detail, why this ship is so marvelous. Because of how excited you are to finally fly, you miss everything other than repeated reference to the 'exceptional' reinforced armor.`
	`	Before you leave, they give you a final tip: "If you want to, you can always sell this ship and buy an Aphid instead. The shipyard authorities will give you a discount for having sold my ship."`
