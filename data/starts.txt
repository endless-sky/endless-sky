	`The bank's architecture is what you would have called "futuristic" back when you dreamed that the future would be less squalid than the present: story above story of curves and spires and balconies, all in gleaming metal. A doorman stands by each of the heavy glass doors. You are wearing your very best clothes, but you feel shabby next to them.`
	`	The loan broker's office is equally intimidating. Large computer monitors fill the walls, with stock quotes and other information spilling down them almost too fast to read. You occasionally glimpse the names of places that you have only seen in movies: Aldebaran. Tarazed. Earth.`
	`	The pen is heavy as lead but glides almost without friction as you print your initials on the bottom of page after page of ominous legal documents and sign several dozen statements, notices, and agreements. The banker, a balding middle-aged man in a suit that you suspect costs more than the spaceship you are about to purchase, flips the pages past you quickly, uttering a curt, "Sign here. Now here," as he points to each page. He moves swiftly, mechanically.`
	`	The only moment when he becomes truly animated is when explaining the Truth in Lending statement to you. "You are borrowing 480,000 credits," he says, "to be repaid over the course of one year. Your daily interest rate is 0.4%, which means that your daily payments are 2,503 credits, and by the end of the year you will have paid... 433,567 credits in interest. Sign here." He grins.`

	`	The elevator is so well-tuned that you do not even realize it is moving until it has deposited you back in the lobby. But as you leave the bank, you are smiling. This crazy adventure suddenly feels real to you. You are going to do it. You are finally going to get off this planet.`
	`	Compared to the bank, you feel much more at home in the shipyard, walking among the rusted out hulks and newer ships that gleam in the sunlight. You smell grease and dirt and rocket fuel; wonderful smells. There are three ship models within your price range. Which one you choose will determine your future...`

	`The train from your hometown rocks side-to-side at a steady rhythm, bringing you ever closer to the capital. Several seats forward, a young couple close to your age eagerly discuss their move to a new apartment as their legs kick their luggage. Behind you, a much older man in greasy overalls exchanges farewells with an acquaintance.`
	`	Before long, you arrive in New Reykjavik at the government office responsible for handling starship loans. The reception is buzzing with activity as other fresh-faced graduates chat among themselves while waiting for their turn. Sunlight falls through the slitted ceiling windows onto a three-dimensional representation of the Deep's insignia in the lobby's center, a red tree with branches forming the shape of a brain. A circle of text surrounds the sculpture, proclaiming the Deep's core values: Peace. Prosperity. Progress.`
	`	Eventually your number is called, and after reading over your application the office worker hands you two cards. One of them is your Certificate of Eligibility for a low-interest loan at a nearby bank. The other is your pilot's license, fully paid for. Your ticket to the stars.`
	`	You insert the card into an automatic clerk at the bank, and after a soft ping, a large document fills its screen. A synthesized voice says, "You are borrowing 680,000 credits to be repaid over the course of a year. Your daily interest rate is 0.2%, which means that your daily payments are 2,627 credits, and by the end of the year you will have paid 278,760 credits in interest.

	`	You rush out of the bank and hop on the metro towards the shipyard. As the rest of the carriage look blankly out the windows and at their devices, you are barely able to keep a straight face, flipping over your pilot's license at least a hundred times before the ride is over. You consider throwing away your transport pass as soon as you get off, but change your mind at the last minute. There won't be much else tying you to this planet soon.`
	`	You had pored over footage of New Reykjavik's shipyard in your younger days, but seeing the place in-person blows your wildest expectations out of the water. Salespeople use holographic displays to showcase a variety of vessels to sharply-dressed clients while skyscraper-sized ships loom silently in the shadows of the yard, waiting for the wealthiest of merchants to claim them. Although most of the ships are far outside of your price range, you spot four models that you'll be able to purchase. Which one you choose will determine your future...`

	`Delve is unlike any planet you've ever been on: the entire spaceport is built into a colossal mountain cave, one side exposed to the open air. The beams and buildings making up the port dwarf the pitiful structures of Antipode, yet feel distinct from the crushing urban landscapes of Earth.`
	`	You hand the last of your credits to the captain that brought you here. Before she leaves, she gives you some advice. "Just a heads up: if you don't feel like dying early, head north after launching. South of here is nothing but uninhabited systems and pirates. You wouldn't last long in any ship you could afford." You thank her for the ride and advice before parting ways.`

You ask him what it would take to purchase a ship here. He mentions the necessity of a pilot's license before beginning his spiel about all the cheapest models, but you cut him short and say that's all you needed.`

You say you're in need of a loan to buy a starship; 600,000 credits should be enough to cover the license and the ship. After you hand over your Syndicated Systems Account information and scan your fingerprint, the teller returns with a piece of paper.`

If you don't pay off any of your loan early, you'll have paid 706,571 credits in interest, more than the 600,000 loan itself. "Just sign here." The teller grins.`

	`	You return to the shipyard, this time with a credit chip in your hand to draw the attention of the salesman. "Welcome back! I hope we can find you the perfect model," he says. The shipyard is full of ships that you can't buy, but the salesman finds three models within your price range: an interceptor, a light freighter, and a transport ship.
