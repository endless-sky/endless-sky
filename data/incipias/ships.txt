	description "The Nimbus is the first spaceship that the Incipias built that was really able to navigate through a system. Since it was first manufactured it has been loved among wealthier captains and a dream of captains just starting out."
	description "Although the Nimbus is labeled as a medium warship, it is a multi-purpose ship. Whether one uses it for mining, passengers or cargo it will perform its job nicely. It is only occasionally used in combat because the Incipias are not fighting open wars."

	description "Mining has always been a big business in Incipias society, that is why the Stratus is one of the most popular ships for captains in their early year, while not too expensive it is able to bring money in quickly. While the stratus could be used in combat, it stands no chance to the Nimbus and therefore has never been used by the Hicemus military forces."

	description "When Pontes was built the need for a ship that could carry material and supplies into the orbit arose. While the Nimbus is able to carry some cargo, it is not specialized for that kind of work. The Cirrus on the other hand is a pure cargo ship and the inhabitants of Pontes rely on the regular deliveries."
