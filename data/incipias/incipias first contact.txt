Left with no other choice you have to stay where you are.`
			`	Luckily it only takes a few minutes until the doors open and three Quarg appear behind it. The one in the middle is wearing clothing that makes clear that it is a military official. The two in the back are wearing full combat gear but do not seem to expect a fight. The one in the middle starts talking in a very strange accent.`

				`	You manage to dock to the disabled ship quite easily. The lock opens and a hallway opens up before you, obviously not built for humans, the walls are strangely curved and the floor has nearly no grip at all. But your view gets caught by the five giant aliens half octopode, half jellyfish, they are pulsating in bright colors, similar to the gradients that appeared on your screen earlier. One of them is floating behind a giant mounted gun, the two barrels are pointed right at you. The gunner flashes in an orange light, and you can feel the tension in the room rising.`

				`	Feeling that the situation could escalate every moment, you slowly place the crate with the repair equipment on the ground, careful to not make any hasty movements and walk back a few steps. No side moves for a moment until one of the aliens slowly moves forward, tones of yellow are now mixing into the orange. Two of their tentacles wrap around the crate, the other four are backing of a little bit. The front one succeeds in finding the opening mechanism, right after it got a look inside, its colors shift to a weak green. The other four also seem to relax as they take on the same color.`
				`	With the repair equipment delivered there is nothing else you can do and communication is not working so you turn around and leave. Just as you leave you can see how the aliens start pulsating in all colors of the spectrum, gradients are moving over their skin so fast that it almost looks white.`
					goto end
				label flee
				`	As the tension starts raising even further, you just drop the repair equipment and run back into your ship, you smash the button that closes the lock. You get a last look on the alien, blue and yellow tones are mixing on their skin, but they are not taking any action.`
				label end
				`	Apparently they figured how to use the repair equipment, as you fly away the engines of the ship are booting back up.`
				`	Back on the bridge your eyes fall on the scanner log that is still open on your screen, notably this ship had no Hyperdrive or anything similar installed, how strange considering there is no inhabitated planet in this system.`
