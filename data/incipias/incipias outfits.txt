	description "The Incipias started to mine asteroids long before they began intrasystem travel due to the proximity of their home world's atmosphere to its rings. As a result this mining tool seems to be more advanced than their general technology, yet it is still not comparable to the efficiency of human weapons."
	description "	The discharger itself shoots bolts of high density plasma that split up into small particles after some time. Because of the plasma infuser the fire rate is exceptional, but the energy usage is severe."

	description "The Stagnation Beam is one of the few technologies of the Incipias that surpasses anything humanity has made thus far - in fact, the first prototypes were built before the Incipias even dreamed of space travel. The weapon's origins lie in giant reactors that were constructed to pull asteroids out of their home planet's orbit, providing easy access to more resources. Naturally, a mechanism to slow the asteroids down was also implemented to prevent accidental asteroid strikes."
	description "	As the Incipias' mastery of spaceflight grew, so did the generators' efficiency, which allowed for more compact, ship-based tractor beams. Resource collection was greatly streamlined by these new models, much to the benefit of the Incipias' otherwise sluggish ships."
	description "	The secret of how these beams work is only known to a few scientists of the Incipias who are under the control of the state. Such knowledge, if made public, could have disastrous consequences for the Hicemus and their grip on power."

	description "Shield technology is one of the most recent developments of the Incipias. While this shield appears similar to a human shield device, it works on a completely different basis. In its core hydrogen is burned, providing energy for regeneration. This proved so effective that it became the main power source of all of their ships."

	description "Hydrogen energy storage was discovered early by the Incipias because of the great amount of metallic hydrogen on their homeworld. Because Incipias ships usually access their energy at the time it is produced, only a small amount of storage is needed. Most of their ships have only one cell installed as a consequence."
