	description "The Incipias started to mine asteroids long before they began intrasystem travel due to the proximity of their home world's atmosphere to its rings. As a result this mining tool seems to be more advanced than their general technology, yet it is still not comparable to the efficiency of human weapons."
	description "	The discharger itself shoots bolts of high density plasma that split up into small particles after some time. Because of the plasma infuser the fire rate is exceptional, but the energy usage is severe."

	description "The Stagnation Beam is one of the few technologies of the Incipias that surpasses anything humanity has made thus far - in fact, the first prototypes were built before the Incipias even dreamed of space travel. The weapon's origins lie in giant reactors that were constructed to pull asteroids out of their home planet's orbit, providing easy access to more resources. Naturally, a mechanism to slow the asteroids down was also implemented to prevent accidental asteroid strikes."
	description "	As the Incipias' mastery of spaceflight grew, so did the generators' efficiency, which allowed for more compact, ship-based tractor beams. Resource collection was greatly streamlined by these new models, much to the benefit of the Incipias' otherwise sluggish ships."
	description "	The secret of how these beams work is only known to a few scientists of the Incipias who are under the control of the state. Such knowledge, if made public, could have disastrous consequences for the Hicemus and their grip on power."

		"Hicemus Conflict"
	description "The Star Tail needs an extreme amount of energy that the Incipias are not able to create in a short amount of time. To accommodate this, the Star Tail Cell contains an energy-rich substance that releases its energy when fired. One of these cells holds enough energy to fire exactly one shot."

	description "Because Star Tail Cells are highly volatile, they need a robust storage system. This radial design is able to withstand minor explosions by using a variant of a shield that can be deployed temporarily."
	description "	One layer of this easily expandable system is already shipped with the gun itself. To increase storage space, more layers are simply stacked on top."

	description `The pinnacle of Incipian technology is represented by this mining utility. Perfected over centuries, this tractor beam is far beyond anything the Incipias have developed so far.

	"shield fuel" .01
	description "Shield technology is one of the most recent developments of the Incipias. While this shield appears similar to a human shield device, it works on a completely different basis. In its core hydrogen is burned, providing energy for regeneration. This proved so effective that it became the main power source of all of their ships."

	"energy generation" 6.1
	"heat generation" 6
	"shield fuel" .02
	description "This more advanced shield generator burns a liquid instead of a gas. This raises the efficiency considerably but also requires more space, making this outfit popular only on larger ships."

outfit "Metallic Hydrogen Cell"
	category "Power"
	thumbnail "outfit/metallic hydrogen cell"
	cost 2500
	mass 20
	"outfit space" -20
	"energy capacity" 500
	description "Hydrogen energy storage was discovered early by the Incipias because of the great amount of metallic hydrogen on their homeworld. Because Incipias ships usually access their energy at the time it is produced, only a small amount of storage is needed. Most of their ships have only one cell installed as a consequence."

	"thrust" 48
	"thrusting energy" 5
	"thrusting heat" 10
	description "The abundance of metallic hydrogen on the Incipias home planet has led to the development of engines that utilize this potent source of energy, allowing for more efficient thrusters than what might be expected given the Incipias' short history of spaceflight."

	"turning heat" 12
	description "Even the Incipias realize that ships need to turn towards their target to be able to shoot it. This steering is specifically designed for combat, but captains with a lot of money find it very useful for mining."
