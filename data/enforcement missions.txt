			`	"You have been found to be in possession of Nerve Gas, and under the articles outlined under Republic Law, you will surrender your supply, and you will be fined accordingly.  Please instruct any crew you have aboard to exit the ship unarmed, single file, five seconds apart, with their hands behind their heads.  You have 10 minutes to comply.`
			`	Before you can even touch the internal comm button, an indicator light turns on "Airlock Open", and the first of your crew approaching the Navy barricade, hands behind their head can be seen out the bridge window.  You quickly realize that resistance would be futile, and would certainly result in your death.`
