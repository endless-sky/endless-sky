	description `Precise and deadly, the Ojet Bimodal Coilgun has been the High Houses' armament of choice since long before humans ever took to the stars. It was designed quite simply as a perfect weapon; it is said that by the time the empire of the Predecessors fell, they had seen no need to install any other weapon on their ships for over a thousand years.`
	description `	The Ojet fires hyperdense packets of charged particles that disperse as they travel: up close the concentrated bolt pierces armor, while at a distance the ionic spray destabilizes shielding. Together, a ship equipped with these weapons can adjust its damage profile just by changing its engagement range, allowing it to be highly effective against any foe.`

	description `Successor warships have traditionally relied on fixed weaponry to deal with their foes, but the High Houses do produce a turreted platform for the Ojet Coilgun so that their larger and slower vessels can maintain their combat effectiveness against more maneuverable targets. It mounts two of the weapons side by side, rigged to fire double the amount of shots per burst to keep them in sync with the fixed hardpoints.`

	description `The Successors have a historical affinity for projectile weaponry which persists to the modern day. The Drag Cannon fires a short-ranged, highly inaccurate blast of projectiles that not only deal substantial damage but also temporarily disrupt the target's engines.`
	description `	While it is an inelegant design in comparison to the time-tested Ojet Coilgun, and consequently less appreciated, the Drag Cannon has found a place on the Successors' fast attack craft primarily as a tool for slowing down enemy vessels so that they can be engaged by a larger fleet.`

As a consequence of this, it is neither especially powerful nor efficient, but its low cost and space requirements make it a nonetheless relatively appealing defensive choice for those without access to the High Houses' more potent weaponry."

Most Successors see the turreted version as a continuation of this democratization of violence, while the more paranoid claim that the High Houses have infiltrated production and intentionally sabotaged the design."

	description `Unable to access large quantities of the high-quality weaponry produced by the High Houses, the People's Houses have had to work with what is available to them: mostly the relatively low-powered pulse lasers produced independently in Successor space. This pulse laser has had its safeties bypassed and its optics upgraded, allowing it to do more damage to shields at a lower power cost in exchange for producing substantially more heat.`

Despite its inelegant design, it is nonetheless a fearsome weapon, especially considering that it retains the ability to partially punch through shielding.`

	description "The largest and most powerful of the Successors' modern weapons, this massive superconducting coilgun is elegant in its simplicity, cleanly perforating targets at extreme range. Although the weapon requires a substantial burst of power in order to fire, it is capable of storing some of this within the coils themselves, allowing it to be fired without additional battery banks at the cost of inflicting a lingering power draw on the ship's systems."
