			`As you approach a central docking port on the citadel, alarms momentarily ring throughout the <ship>'s bridge as numerous weapon locks are detected. A moment later they cease and Saajret radios you from their own craft that it is safe to land, the shape of the Vujlet disappearing into the station's wide mouth.`
			`	The inside is truly cavernous; the circular vault of the station's core forms an artificial sky, the landing pad for your ship a stamp-sized rectangle on its perimeter. Saajret exits from their landed ship and meets you with a pair of Kaatrij soldiers; you recognize one as having accompanied Kampa before when they interrogated you.`
			`	"I've added us as allies in the station's security rolls," says Saajret. "It should permit us access below." They check a data-pad that they produce from one of their pockets, looking from the shifting metallic screen to the layout of the docking bay. Eventually, they point to one of several circular apertures on the floor. As you approach, a large elevator pod emerges from it and its doors open expectantly.`

To cloak a station is a function of its armor, its surface - the power to feed that cloak is a function of its volume. A larger citadel was more efficient to hide away." They rub the tips of two of their arms over a data-sphere embedded in the elevator pod.`
			choice
				`	"How far down are we going?"`

			label down
			`	"We shall want to check the systems core and the vault, at least," says Saajret. "A very long way, for certain."`
			`	The elevator takes the four of you down for several minutes; every once in a while, a window to the outside shows individual flashes of the sun setting as the station continues in its orbit. It finally stops on a platform overlooking a vast, dizzyingly-tall space, where pillars rise up for what seems like kilometers below you and terminate kilometers above. Myriad cargo containers are attached to their sides, and between them rest eight gleaming starships. Some of the designs are familiar, like polished versions of those you've seen in Successor space; others are entirely new to you.`
			`	Saajret directs their two soldiers to set up a trio of small poles on the surface of the platform. They then radio to their ship and the poles light up, projecting barely-visible laser scanning beams throughout the vast space. After a couple of seconds, they mutter something to themself and order the soldiers to pack up the scanners.`

			`	You all return to the elevator and it once again begins to plunge you deeper into the citadel. You start to feel something prickling in your ear, but it is gone as soon as it began. The views of outside stop and the elevator shaft seems to grow darker and redder as the four of you travel deeper. Eventually it reaches another platform, but the door of the elevator refuses to open. Saajret enters some commands on the elevator controls, and the reason is revealed: as the elevator's door blushes transparent, you can see the corridor behind it has been perforated and torn open from outside. In the distance you can see a blast door leading into an armored, spherical construction, but that too has been blasted apart.`
			`	Saajret mutters darkly and once again orders the soldiers to set up the scanners, and once again they project their beams, now through the transparent door and into the breached segment. A wave of black ruffles over Saajret's skin. "All but one of the station's cloaking nodes have been remov'd. So strange..." they say, "to have stolen these and yet left the vault unassailed." The wave passes, leaving only colorlessness in its wake. "We must bring this news with haste. Let us hurry back."`
			`	All of a sudden, the station's comm system crackles to life. A rapid series of interweaving clicks emerge, and they soon shift and warp in your ears as your translation device begins to interpret them. "Interloper!" something screams, and you feel dizzy. "Despoiler! Invading wretch!"`
			choice
				`	(Rip off the translation device.)`
				`	(Try to block out the sounds.)`
			`	As soon as you move, something punches against your inner ear and you crumple to the ground. The screaming voice stops, and another one takes its place, less pointed but no less painful. "We recognize thy kind," it says. "And the other with thee, too. Saajret?" As their name is spoken, Saajret stands over you, their words unintelligible. The voice shifts again. "Deceiver!" it screams. "Thou who hast plundered beast and bone from where they should'st forever lie!"`
			choice
				`	"I'm trying to stop the thieves!"`
				`	"How are you in my head!?"`
				`	"What about Saajret?"`
			`	The rage of the artificial voice chills. "Insignificant," it shouts, and as something else begins to interleave with the sound, something sharp and painful, there comes a quiet final phrase: "I missed thee," the voice says. "I missed thee."`
			`	And all of a sudden it stops; the pain, the voice. The pressure fades away from your head and Saajret looks down at you, the translation device plucked from your body and held in their arm. They help you to your feet and return it to you; you store it in a pocket, deactivated.`
			`	Saajret confers with their guards for a moment, their words a mess of unintelligible sound. One of them interacts with the elevator controls and the carriage starts to move upwards again, the station's com system shrieking to no avail. Saajret comes to speak to you, gently poking your chest with the tip of one of their arms; they say something that sounds a bit like your name. Suddenly the elevator is shaken by an impact from outside and soon after, dozens more. The four of you are deposited back in the landing bay just as you catch a glimpse of a ship in the distance firing on the station. You dash back to your own craft and prepare to flee or fight.`

Thou'rt authorized to attend the ceremony this afternoon and, following, a special meeting of the locally-gathered Houses." The voice continues for a while, providing you with information on which rooms to visit and how you are to find your way there.`
			`	Soon after, you catch sight of Khiajsore, the Myurej scion you spoke with before. They catch sight of you as well and slither towards you, batting away one of the threads with a bejeweled arm. "Captain, captain, delightful Captain," they say. "How pleasant of thee to accept our invitation."`
			choice
				`	"I appreciated your extending it."`

				`	"It's a very impressive facility you have here."`

				goto khiajsore

			label appreciate
			`	"For such a unique and industrious figure, 'twould've been an unbearable snub not to!"`

			label khiajsore
			`	They rattle one of their arms a little, red gold and sparkling stones swinging through the air. "I just spoke of thee, in fact, with a delegate of House Seineq here, who confirmed what I've heard that thou were't of use to them as well! I think," they say, "thou set a good example for future aliens - benevolent, equitable, humble. Though I hear now Kaatrij has obtained thy vassalage? A boon to them, no doubt." Their face sparkles with color, eyes alight with furtive interest. "Though I hope for our efforts, Myurej has earned some measure of thy favor."`
			choice
				`	"I'm happy to help, so long as it doesn't conflict with my other responsibilities."`
				`	"I'm not sure I like where this is going."`
			`	Khiajsore laughs. "Of course, of course," they say. "Thou hast already helped us greatly. Now please excuse me."`
			`	They leave and two members of the crowd break off the follow them, which you notice carry small weapons strapped to their outfits. One of the golden threads makes its way back to you, informing you that the wedding ceremony will be beginning soon.`
			choice
				`	(Attend the wedding.)`
				`	(Wait around until the later meeting.)`
					goto skipped
			`	While most Successors are waiting outside the entrance to what must be a massive room, you are instead guided to an inconspicuous and out-of-the-way door, guarded by a pair of Successor soldiers. Neither one reacts to your attempt to pass, and as you step behind the door, it becomes clear why you aren't lining up with the general public: that massive room is entirely filled with water, a gigantic sphere with lights, platforms, and countless seats all built within it. A few small rooms like the one you now stand in are built into the walls like little transparent air bubbles at the shore of a great sea.`
			`	You are joined by three other Successors after a few minutes, each of whom takes their place in the little room. The ceremony begins shortly after. From apertures in the bottom of the sphere, legions of soldiers emerge, half wearing the colors of House Chydiyi and the other half of House Myurej. The two small armies swim around each other, interleaving their lines of bodies like the Ribbons themselves that you saw outside.`
			`	Only after a half hour of this acrobatics do the couple finally appear, rising up from the same apertures and joined by a flanking group of what must be the scions of their respective houses. You spy Khiajsore among them. There is a further intertwining, a display of gold and colors, and then a collective hum rises from the crowd.`
			choice
				`	(Hum also.)`
				`	(Remain silent.)`
			`	With the moment apparently passed, speeches follow, each of the scions offering some short dialog about the history of their house and their hopes for its future. The translation device struggles to make sense of many of the words, as if they're being said in a dialect it's unfamiliar with. Eventually the ceremony seems to come to a close, the enormous audience trickling out of their seats and returning to mill about the facility.`

			label skipped
			`	You wait around for a little while until one of the threads comes to find you, giving you directions to an out-of-the-way room. Inside are representatives of all six High Houses; among them Khiajsore of House Myurej, Riijaaora of House Sioeora, and Kampa of House Kaatrij.`
			`	Kampa takes to the pool in the center of the room, addressing the group: "Honored representatives of the Houses assembled. House Kaatrij calls this union to make public our declaration of suzerainty to the alien captain <first> <last>. In keeping with the inter-Houses Treaty on Alien Agents, we herefore shall provide our vassal the violent fruits of our House, so that they might adequately and securely perform their duties.`
			`	In keeping with the Treaty, this offer may be extended by the other Houses in courtesy and deference to sovereign Kaatrij."`
			`	They step back to the rim of the pool and three others take to the pool's center: Myurej, Aqrabe, and Seineq. Each one speaks in turn, variations on a phrase: "In appreciation with the captain's service to our House, we provide our assent to and recognition of this offer."`
			`	Chydiyi's representative stays on the edge of the pool, abstaining from the discussion, but Sioeora's takes the center, glaring at you.`

			`	When they return to the edge, no more is said. Kampa returns to the pool and produces a small box from their outfit, which they give to you.`

			`	"Let this gift make clear to all thy responsibilities and privileges, and may thou have free access to all our House and allies offer..." Kampa says, "<first> <last>, Honored Knight-Vassal of the High House Kaatrij."`
			`	With this, the meeting concludes, the various members exiting in turn - the ones you've met before offering some short words of congratulations. You eventually exit as well, finding your way back through the facility. By a floral display you spy Saajret, apparently deep in conversation with Tiliia, the House Seineq engineer.`

			`	Tiliia spots you first, their skin breaking out in colors of excitement. "Saajret tells me of thy assent to Kaatrij's ranks," they say. "Excellent that thou might be a concerted ally to my own House as well."`
			`	Saajret hums and nods. "The captain is a canny sort," they say. "Capable of surviving our wiles, I believe." Tiliia laughs at that, Saajret continuing. "And Tiliia tells me thou were't of help to them as well, the reason by which our craft now gain an advantage through the wormhole."`

			`	Tiliia interjects at this, a hint of embarrassment on their skin. "T'was a matter of managing with what could be done," they say.`

It is built into an amphitheatre-shaped cutout of a seaside cliff, terraced homes and shops emerging from the rock with their curious flowing Kaatrij architecture. Many share the sail-like projections of the main spaceport, some decorated with iridescent patterns that shimmer as the wind tosses them.`
			`	Saajret meets you at the regional spaceport, explaining that you caught them on a day off. They lead you through the town to one of the more elegant homes. It's shaped like a series of concentric semicircles, and they invite you into the outermost one, what you might call a receiving area with benches and indoor gardens. Small robots slither over the floors, attending to dust and water.`

			`	Something about hearing their name in this context seems to strike a discordant chord within Saajret. All at once confusion and anger and sorrow flit over them before they tense and their skin becomes a steely gray. They say nothing more on the matter, instead striking up a conversation about your recent experiences and never slowing. After an hour or so of catching up, they've finally had enough and let the conversation die.`
			`	As you leave, Saajret turns to you a final time. A strange expression is sitting on their face, and their skin seems incapable of resolving into a single color display. "Thou hast my deepest thanks, my friend," they say, sounding a little haunted, and close the door.`
