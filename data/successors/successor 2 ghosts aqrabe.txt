			`Shortly after landing here, you are approached by a tall Successor in unusual dress; though dark, it shimmers in the light with many little golden flecks. It is unlike any other Successor outfit you've seen. "Greetings, Captain," they say, curiously sonorous. "Noble House Aqrabe kindly requests thy presence in the eastern spaceport reliquary. I've been instructed to take thee there, at thy own discretion, of course."`

			`	They lead you through several restricted areas of the spaceport to a thin tower on its periphery. The room you enter into is tremendous and circular; a shallow watery depression in the center is matched by an enormous semicircular tank that bulges down from above, almost touching the floor as it swoops towards the wet floor. What's inside it proves even more striking, however: soon, what look like the severed limbs of Successors begin to writhe downwards in the tank, each suspended by a number of glittering golden threads that snake up into the dark abyss of the overhead water. You look around to ask your guide what's happening, but they have already left. One of the arms rubs up against the glass, its undead suckers making faint popping sounds as they pass over it.`

Tiliia joins you in walking back to the <ship> to examine the cargo; when they're sufficiently satisfied that you've brought the proper amount, they pull out a data-pad and enter a couple of values.

			`	The observer looks you over with an emotionless gaze. "Our efforts shall protect the craft from the star's heat, but little else. 'T'would be wise not to linger in the Tangles."`

Tiliia, after entering a bit of data on their pad, finally relaxes, quietly reciting a series of harsh-sounding and apparently untranslatable words.`
			`	"Do you know something about those ships?" you ask them, eliciting a long groan and a wave of oily black over their skin.`

'Tis strange to be accused by one so foreign to our ways. But we've been cut off a long time now, I think, hearing only from ourselves and the ghosts of others. Greater things are moving than either of us now, but thou may'st trust that I'll be careful with our treasure. I can promise thee nothing more, but thou'rt right to remind me of that, at least."`
