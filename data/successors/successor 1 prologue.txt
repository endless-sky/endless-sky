			`After trudging through several shrouded and mostly-dead systems, you've finally found a planet with living inhabitants. As you enter the planet's upper atmosphere, your ship is surrounded by a trio of interceptors and thoroughly scanned. Soon after, the lead ship transmits a hail to you in a sharply flowing alien language before proceeding to a spaceport complex floating on a large structure along the coastline. The group corrals you onto one of the few fully-dry landing pads, and as the minutes wear on, a small crowd begins to form around your ship.`

			`	The predominant species of aliens you see here are enormous octopods that rise up from the ground on their long, suckered arms. On average, they stand about three meters tall even with their arms coiled beneath them. Those standing on dry land are joined by others who slither out of a network of water-filled pools and channels to come and watch you. Their skin glistens with mucous wetness and you can see it changing color and texture as they run their hourglass-shaped pupils over your person and your ship.`
			`	After a couple of minutes of activity within the crowd, one uniformed and especially vibrant individual breaks away from the rest and begins to move towards you, gliding gently and silently over the ground.

			`	After waiting for several minutes, a shuttle lands on the pad beside yours and several individuals emerge from it. Two of them move in front of the rest, where they are allowed to pass by the guards and approach you. The one on the left is a uniformed officer wearing what appears to be heavy body armor with shimmering metallic plates that sparkle in the light. On the right is a smaller alien who is wrapped up in a dark, cocoon-like outfit from which their head and arms emerge. The officer says something to the smaller one, who quietly replies and then pulls from a pocket on their outfit a smooth sheet which they inspect several times before haltingly addressing you.`

Each successive hall you pass through is a unique and enormous sculpture: the arch of a wave moments before crashing; the spiral of a huge suckered arm.

Unifying them all is a small white and blue pin attached to their outfits; one that does not correspond to the insignia of any of the High Houses. The officers guide you, politely but firmly, to one of the monorail trains snaking out from the spaceport to other installations on the planet, and you all shuffle together into one of the cars, which appears to have been completely cleared of normal passengers, if it even carried those in the first place.`
