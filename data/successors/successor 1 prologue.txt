			`After trudging through several shrouded and mostly-dead systems, you've finally found a planet with living inhabitants. As you enter the planet's upper atmosphere, your ship is surrounded by a trio of interceptors and thoroughly scanned. Soon after, the lead ship transmits a hail to you in a sharply flowing alien language before proceeding to a spaceport complex floating on a large structure along the coastline. The group corrals you onto one of the few fully-dry landing pads, and as the minutes wear on, a small crowd begins to form around your ship.`

			`	The predominant species of aliens you see here are enormous octopods that rise up from the ground on their long, suckered arms. On average, they stand about three meters tall even with their arms coiled beneath them. Those standing on dry land are joined by others who slither out of a network of water-filled pools and channels to come and watch you. Their skin glistens with mucous wetness and you can see it changing color and texture as they run their hourglass-shaped pupils over your person and your ship.`
			`	After a couple of minutes of activity within the crowd, one uniformed and especially vibrant individual breaks away from the rest and begins to move towards you, gliding gently and silently over the ground.

The leader in turn offers it to you, and burbles an unintelligible phrase in what you might have characterized as an encouraging tone.

			`	After waiting for several minutes, a shuttle lands on the pad beside yours and several individuals emerge from it. Two of them move in front of the rest, where they are allowed to pass by the guards and approach you. The one on the left is a uniformed officer wearing what appears to be heavy body armor with shimmering metallic plates that sparkle in the light. On the right is a smaller alien who is wrapped up in a dark, cocoon-like outfit from which their head and arms emerge. The officer says something to the smaller one, who quietly replies and then pulls from a pocket on their outfit a smooth sheet which they inspect several times before haltingly addressing you.`

"Thy lib'ral patience is well-appreciated." They splay their arms in the same manner as when you were first greeted by the Successors, and the two others behind them do so as well. "Ah," they continue, "but thou surely must be curious as to why we've called thee here. Thine actions, knowing or not, have benefited this noble House, and 'twould be craven fools to fail to recognize that fact. Prithee understand thee now that Raaqa-Uur-Kaav was our world and not Sioeora's. So too, the Kijran, ours, were never theirs to hold or grasp for."`

Why was it that the life of our world endured while the life of the rest has long since perished, eroded by the harshness of the gravid void 'tween blasted stars?

And surely too, will the details of this meeting eventually become apparent to the other Houses and their scions."`
			`	Saajret pauses for a moment to straighten some aspects of their clothing, before gesturing to a small wooden pin affixed to an outer layer of fabric. "We keep a number of these devices, full of sound and language, but very few for thine own tongue: this is the only one for which that we possess. I'm told it is an art piece, commissioned for a performance of thine own Shakespeare's Tempest so that our Predecessors could experience the work in its original form.

Officially, thou shalt be a patronized guest of House Kaatrij and shall proceed with our protection and our blessings.

You notice that this group appears even more diverse than the last, representing several different uniform styles and liveries. Unifying them all is a small white and blue pin attached to their outfits; one that does not correspond to the insignia of any of the High Houses. The officers guide you, politely but firmly, to one of the monorail trains snaking out from the spaceport to other installations on the planet, and you all shuffle together into one of the cars, which appears to have been completely cleared of normal passengers, if it even carried those in the first place.`
