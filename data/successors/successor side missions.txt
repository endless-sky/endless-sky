"Our deepest thanks, captain," Jaasora says to you once you have landed in the spaceport as Nnesa wrestles with the tent and cart. "'Twas a true and joyful voyage." Nnesa calls them over; the tent clearly requires at least two to handle. Jaasora presents you with your payment of <payment> and goes to help, and the two of them maneuver their equipment out of your cargo bay before shouting a hasty but good-humored farewell.`

			`Shortly after you disembark the <ship> for the spaceport on <source>, you hear a quiet but noticeable clattering from behind you near where your ship is being refueled.`
			choice
				`	(Investigate the sound.)`
				`	(Ignore it.)`
					goto ignored
			`	Upon approaching the source of the clattering, you catch a trio of Successors in the process of smearing the hull of the <ship> with globs of a colorful, foul-smelling solution. It is so pungent you can barely approach them without retching, but the Successors seem not to notice, or not to care.`
			choice
				`	"What are you doing to my ship?"`
					goto what
				`	"Excuse me, are you all part of the repair crew?"`
			`	The three Successors startle at the sound of your voice, arms whipping around as they turn to face you. One makes a move to run away, but one of the others clamps onto their arm and reels them back alongside them. All three slowly turn a shade of dull purple and their skin seems to contract over the underlying musculature. One of them eventually replies. "Yes, correct thou is! We've orders to apply this ... hull solution to repair a spot of damage here."`
			`	Waves of color run up the bodies of the others, and the tips of their arms undulate gently.`
			choice
				`	"I've never seen a solution like that before. How does it work?"`
					goto how
				`	"I'm sorry to interrupt in that case. Carry on."`
					goto fooled

			`	The group look around at each other before the same one replies again. "The... ah... solution seeps into the cracks and strains within the hull and when it dries it seals them. Beyond that, we do not know; we just apply it as directed by the port authority."`
			`	One of the other ones pipes up, cheerfully adding, "We don't know anything!" before the others give them a dark look.`
			choice
				`	"And it's so colorful too! Are you sure it's not a paint of some sort?"`
					goto colorful
				`	"Fascinating. Carry on."`
					goto fooled

			label colorful
			`	"Oh, that's for... ah... safety. Yes, 'tis very dangerous to touch if thou'r'nt trained, so 'tis bright in color as a warning." None of the three are wearing any sort of protective equipment that you can see, and by now most of the group have changed color to what you might characterize as a mirthful shade of pink. This is something which one or two are clearly trying to suppress, their skin shifting in gradients in an effort to maintain their previous dull purple hue. One of the others is trying to hide a bag filled with more cans of "hull solution" behind their arms.`
			choice
				`	"Well, if you're working on behalf of the port, then surely I can ask you to remove it as well."`
					goto called
				`	"Nice try, but you and I both know what's going on here."`
					goto called
				`	"I think my ship's hull has been well enough repaired. It might be best for you to attend to whatever other vessels are on your list."`
					goto complicit
				`	"Thanks for answering my questions. Please carry on."`
					goto fooled

			label called
			`	The trio seem rather deflated at hearing this, but after quite a bit of milling amongst themselves eventually relent and agree to remove the solution so long as you don't inform the port authority about their actions. While they put good effort into removing it---or at least act the part---they can't seem to scrub away the most dried-on parts, and you eventually let them go after it becomes apparent that some of the paint has permanently bonded to the hull.`
				decline

			label complicit
			`	The trio brighten up at hearing this, and after some milling amongst themselves eventually glide off into the spaceport with their cans of solution in tow, though not before leaving one with you for "emergency repairs," though considering how terrible it smells it's not certain if you could ever stand trying to apply it.`

			`	Upon returning from the spaceport some time later, you find that an area on the side of the <ship> has been covered in a thick, colorful solution with an incredibly noxious smell so potent you can hardly bear to approach it. The pattern forms some words in the Successor script, and while the translation device struggles to interpret the non-standard glyphs, it eventually offers a translation along the lines of "Ryiaa was here (and friends.)" The defacement takes several hours for the spaceport crews to sufficiently scour off, but a small degree of discoloration remains permanently bonded to the hull plating for the foreseeable future.`
