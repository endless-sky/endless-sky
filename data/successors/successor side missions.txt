			`	Taaquvaleq fidgets slightly, their chromatophores pulsing a nervous green. "If these do not work, I fear we may need a... less elegant solution."`
			`With a quick input, you send the access codes provided by House Seineq. For a long, tense moment, nothing happens. Then, with a deep groan of ancient machinery, the station stirs. Metal locks disengage with a heavy clunk, and an exterior platform extends from the side of the structure, illuminated by flickering red emergency lights. A docking corridor hisses open, revealing a passageway into the refinery's depths.`
			`	Stepping inside, the air is thick, stale, and laced with the scent of industrial decay. The walls are covered in layers of frost where life support systems have long since faltered. Dim emergency lighting provides just enough illumination to reveal the vast corridors-hallways built for purposes long forgotten, their surfaces worn by time.`
			`	As you explore, you find evidence of ancient machinery, massive processing units still wired into the refinery's core. But they are dead. Silent. Whatever fueled this place has long since run dry.`
			`	Taaquvaleq moves between the consoles, running a hand over the corroded interfaces. "A relic," they murmur, their chromatophores shifting into thoughtful blues. "It breathes no more, yet... it remembers.`
			`	The Seineq Guard, standing alert, clicks their armored limbs together. "We have no time for reverie. We came for the yield."`
			`Further in, you find rows of massive storage containers, their identification markings faded. Most are empty-some completely hollowed out, others lined with only the faintest traces of residual isotopes. But at the very end of the chamber, one container remains full.`
			`	As you scan it, your instruments confirm its contents: a large cache of refined isotopes, preserved through centuries, waiting. The very material Seineq once used in their greatest technological ambitions.`
			`	Taaquvaleq's chromatophores flare with sudden excitement. "This... this is enough! A fraction of this could restore what was lost! We-"`
			`	The Guard steps between them and the container, their skin shifting to an authoritative gray. "It shall go to Seineq's vaults first. All of it."`
			`	Taaquvaleq's excitement dims, their chromatophores flickering uncertainly, but they hold their tongue. For now.`
			`You make preparations to transport the haul.`

			`As you land at the grand estate of House Seineq, the station's atmosphere feels tense yet expectant. The Seineq Guard disembarks first, striding ahead to announce your arrival. Taaquvaleq follows, their chromatophores flickering between anxious blues and cautious greens.`
			`Once more, you are led through ornate halls, their towering columns shimmering under the glow of bioluminescent engravings. At the far end of the chamber, the Seineq Veythiq awaits, adorned in elaborate metallic bands that signal both power and tradition.`
			`The Scion of House Seineq extends a limb, their chromatophores shifting to deep violet as they study the recovered isotopes. "Thou return'st, and with that which was promised." The words carry the weight of solemn approval. "A task well-wrought, and well-received."`
			`Their gaze drifts to Taaquvaleq, whose skin flashes bright green-elation-before settling into respectful indigo. "House Seineq doth honor its word. Thee shall have two weight of the isotopes recovered-no more, no less." Veythiq's voice turns precise, each syllable measured. "'Tis enough to complete thy craft, yet scarce enough to tempt folly."`
			`"Thy House is most generous," Taaquvaleq murmurs, their limbs curling in a gesture of gratitude. "With but this fraction, I may weave anew what was once lost."`
			`A sudden tension fills the chamber as Seineq Veythiq steps forward, their chromatophores darkening like storm clouds. "Now, mark this well, travelers." The air grows heavy with unspoken threat. "What thou hast seen, what thou hast taken-none but thee shall know. House Seineq grants thee this yield, but in return, we demand silence."`
			`Behind them, the armored Seineq guard moves with deliberate menace, their segmented plates scraping against each other. "Swear it now," they rumble, the sound vibrating through the damp air, "before the House, before the void itself. No record, no tale, no whispered word beyond these halls."`
			`The Scion's skin ripples black at the edges-a final warning. "The secrets of Avasaa-Aa-Tej are not for the tongues of lesser minds. Speak naught of what transpired, nor of what was found..." They let the pause stretch, their meaning clear. "...lest thou invite ruin upon thine own house."`
			`As you prepare to depart, Taaquvaleq draws near, "If thy curiosity yet lingers, traveler... meet me upon O-Vasa-Oa. The final threads are almost woven. None else shall test it. If thou wouldst see what hath become of our labor... come."`

			`The spaceport air grows thick as you disembark, the usual hum of activity replaced by unnatural stillness.

The procession stops before a towering figure standing beneath a massive relief of the Predecessors' downfall. Zaathiq's chromatophores burn black with barely-contained fury as they turn to face you.`

			`They pace, anger spilling from every flicker of their skin. "Taaquvaleq may not have known, or perhaps they did. But make no mistake: the isotopes recovered from Avasaa-Aa-Tej did not enable progress. They reawakened ruin."`
			`They produce a holographic emitter, its flickering light revealing star maps torn asunder. "See here the Tangles - not natural formations, but scars from the Point Drive's ravages. The isotopes within thy drive's heart, the very same that powered our ancestors' ruin, should never have been disturbed again. They were used as fuel-stabilizing catalysts within our Predecessors' burning chambers, and their instability tore apart the fabric of space itself." Their skin pulses with grief-stricken blue.
