			`After trudging through several shrouded and mostly-dead systems, you've finally found a planet with living inhabitants. As you enter the planet's upper atmosphere, your ship is surrounded by a trio of interceptors and thoroughly scanned. After a brief delay, the lead ship transmits an unintelligible hail to you and slowly proceeds to a spaceport complex floating on a large structure on the planet's coast, where the group corrals you onto one of the few fully-dry landing pads. As the minutes wear on, a small crowd begins to form around your landing site.`
			`	The aliens here remind you most of octopi: they are substantially taller than you, rising up off of the ground by several long suckered arms. Those standing on dry land are joined by several others who slither out of shallow, water-filled pools in the spaceport to come and watch you. Their skin glistens with mucous wetness and you can see it changing color and texture as they run their hourglass-shaped pupils over your person and your ship.`
			`	After a couple of minutes of activity within the crowd, one uniformed and especially vibrant individual breaks away from the rest and begins to move towards you, gliding gently and silently over the ground.

Officially, thou shalt be a patronized guest of House Kaatrij and shall proceed under our protection and with our blessings.
