It is from these devices that the music emanates.`
			`	One of the Successors in the pool begins to sing - at least, singing is the best way you could describe it; they press one of the longer and more cylindrical instruments up to their head and it begins producing an accompaniment to the other instruments' melody that your translation device occasionally recognizes as words:`
			`	"... sweetest child... never want... not so... somber current... endure..."`
			`	It is not clear whether or not this represents the entire lyric content of the performance or simply if the translation device is unable to parse the more tonal phrases. The submerged singer displays a variety of colors and textures on their skin, changing with each successive phrase; green and rough on a splittingly high note, pink and smooth-looking on a strangely growl-like low section.

Several of the benches have been built up into small but richly adorned boxes where, presumably, the wealthiest members of the audience can enjoy the show in privacy.`

It begins with thanking the local House for funding the event, continues into naming and introducing each of the lead actors, and finishes with a curious ritual in which each of the actors is given a small decorative token by the show's organizer. The actors thread these onto long strings that they carry - several of them already have highly-adorned strings that they loop several times over their bodies.`

			`	The play turns out to be remarkably long, and immensely complex. The plot follows both mortal Successors, on the dry stage, and the gods in the water beneath them. Myiara Raaja was the adoptive child of one of the gods, eternally youthful in their immortal realm, but who ran away to the mortal world while the gods slumbered. There, they lived a long and full life before eventually dying and leaving behind their only child, Myiara Sera. The awakened gods, lamenting the loss of their child, dispatch their messenger Irja to retrieve the elder Myiara from the world above, but Irja, blinded by joy, mistakes the younger Myiara Sera for Myiara Raaja. In a desperate show of wit, Myiara Sera manages to poison Irja with a draught of eternal sleep, smearing it on a fine cloak that the god cannot resist, thinking it to be a reunion gift from their long-lost child.`
			`	To maintain their freedom, Myiara Sera descends into the immortal world, tearfully poisoning each of the gods one-by-one in a similar fashion, eventually leaving them as they began - slumbering, caught in the slow gyration of the undersea currents. By the epilogue, Myiara Sera has two children themself, one who remains forever with the gods, coaxing them into ever-deeper dreamful sleep, the other who lives on in the mortal world and gives rise to a family of heroes, each of whom have their own plays and other cultural products.`
			`	"This one shall linger, unmaligned, insensate, in the sepulchre'f of the deep. And all the weeping masses 'bove, below shall in their memory keep, and render off'rings...`
			`	The production of the performance is strikingly alien - each of the actors wears a complex mask of their character that articulates with their face beneath it. The masks of the mortal characters are straightforward, if expressive, but those of the gods are enormous and dramatic. Many have long, ribbony parts that never settle in the currents of the tank, constantly swirling around the heads of the actors.`
			`	Characters jump between the mortal and immortal realms by acrobatic leaps between the water-filled tank and its mostly-dry top surface. When particular moments are meant to be highlighted, enormous splashes of water erupt from behind the stage, and during others, long strands of the writhing Successor metal rise from around it, forming forests, ocean waves, and terrible storms out of their gleaming lengths.`
