			`	The two take you to a dense nest of shops and hotels on a hill overlooking one of the massive spaceport's loading docks; it lies what must be more than a hundred meters below. A web of canals interleaves the regularly-misted streets, and looking inside, you can see groups of Successors swimming in various directions, occasionally emerging onto the terrestrial paths and shaking off water from the hydrophobic fabrics of their clothing. You are led to a small, comfortable-looking hotel overlooking one of these canals, and deposited in a medium-sized oblong room, divided roughly in half by an oily-colored fabric screen. The guards motion for you to sit on a chair on one side of it, and you comply.`
			`	From the other side of the screen comes a slow voice that your translation device duly rearranges into your language: "Captain <first> <last>, I believe?"`
			choice
				`	"Yes?"`
				`	"Who's asking?"`
			`	"House Myurej longs to exercise thy services. Something belonging to us was stolen. Thou shalt be compensated for its safe return. Doth this interest thee?" The screen shimmers in one long, glittery wave. Behind you, one of the guards shuffles.`
			`	"You're going to have to give me more than that," you say.`
			`	The wave rebounds off the far wall and retraces its way back down the screen. "Hast thou before entered into the bonds of matrimony?" the voice says. Before you can respond, it continues. "'Tis customary, when one doth, for the celebrants to render some minor gifts upon the duly unified, a commemmoration of the families' intertwining evermore. To steal such trinkets would be a base and wretched act - a child-race as yours should still conceive of that." The wave continues to echo, back and forth. "A certain knave'f the so-called People's Houses thought it wise to thus insult this happy House, on the eve of another day of joy, no doubt thinking with a dead mind they lay beyond our reach. Bring back our gifts, and we shall pay thee..." The voice pauses for a while, as if away in thought. "And perhaps thou wilt have earned a favor, though alien thou might'st be."`

Our agents here shall see thou receives their details at thy ship." You hear the rustling of fabric and the faint wet slithering of a Successor moving. The guards behind you relax and, as you turn to look at them, they gesture towards the door. Before you leave, the voice speaks one last time. "Do not fail us, captain."`

			`	Exploring the visitor-accessible part of the station is an unusual experience - there's a striking contrast between the presence of all the advanced technologies of the Successors and the fact that so many of them are in such disrepair. You've seen Successor constructions that are hundreds or even thousands of years old in better condition than those here. You try to talk to a few of the Successors around here about Riiria, but they all quickly dismiss you, most without even saying a word.`
			`	Eventually you find your way to a shop of some sort, what looks like a gutted Myaede bolted to the station's structure and filled with displays of fabric and ship parts, all attended to by about a dozen small robots running on tracks on the ceiling. They follow you around like a school of fish - a couple of them have some ominous-looking apertures on their front. Suddenly, you hear the edited sound of Successor speech behind one of the displays of what looks like engine injectors. A small screen is projecting an image of a speaking Successor:`

For long the Old've wanted us gone entire, and believe me, this'll be the start'f it! Well, 'f they come for us, Riiria will make them bleed like I always do!"

			`	"No, not angry," they say. "Tired. They pay me to change my routes, I accept. They pay me to talk to the fools they send to me, I accept. They pay me to transport unknowables, and I lap it up. Thought the family connection would make things easier, but what dost thou do when that 'family's just after thee for thy use to them?"

The Successor pauses to look at one of the boxes being unloaded and makes an exasperated noise. "Not that being thee is aught I would prefer, mind."`

				`	"Thank you."`
				`	"Finally."`
			`	Color once again bristles over their skin, but only for a moment. "Now go 'fore the two of us are seen together," they say, and wave you away. You find your way back to your own ship and mark the nearby uninhabited station on your map.`

And ringing the walls are thousands upon thousands of circular insets, each one many meters in diameter, each one with a panel on the front taking - no doubt - a unique data-sphere.`

				`	"I had no idea the Houses had this much."`
				`	"We can't be here just for jewelry, can we?"`
			`	"Myurej had dozens of these vaults," Ijaset says. "Most not here, not on the homeworld. Ships, weapons, great riches grown in the heart of stars... all should be preserved, lest the Quarg or some other despoilers have come to empty them. Today we come for trinkets, so tomorrow we can come for the rest."`

				`	"With the contents of a vault like this, any of the Houses could dominate the others, couldn't it?"`
			`	One of the soldiers says something to Ijaset, loud enough for you to hear, but in a dialect your translation device doesn't pick up. They nod. "Kaatrij wounded, the People's Houses in disarray, even fair Myurej soon to be drawn ever closer to Chydiyi. 'Tis a time of change and the uncertain. With the contents of a vault as this, any of the Houses could make their own certainty."`
			label next
			`	Ijaset confers with their datapad and leads the three of you a couple of degrees along the great room's circumference, stopping in front of one of the insets. They produce from a pocket a gilded data-sphere that they press into its face, and you watch as the golden strands encircling it lay themselves out on the front of the surface, forming a fractal web of glittering metal. When they finally stop moving, the whole face of the inset liquefies, gold and all. Behind it lies a deep circular room stacked with elegant wooden boxes. The four of you enter and Ijaset collects a few small items, most no larger than your hand. They give most to the soldiers, but reserve three or four to carry themself.`
			`	"That's it?" you say.`
			`	"Indeed," says Ijaset. "A shame to leave the rest, I know, but if it's stayed a thousand years, it shall bear another one."`
			`	You all retreat from the vault room; Ijaset first, followed by you and then the soldiers. As their last trailing arm slides over the threshold, the face of the vault reforms as quickly as it had melted, the golden strands retract back to the data-sphere, and the whole room is left as it was before. As you prepare to go back up, however, something sharp pings in your ear.`
			choice
				`	"What is that?"`
				`	"Did you hear that?"`
			`	Ijaset looks over at you with a shade of concern on their face. They open their mouth, but nothing understandable comes out - just the same sharply flowing language you heard from the Successors before you acquired the translation device. Then, a second later, there's another sharp feeling and their words are reshaped. "...thine ears? Can'st thou... now, I see it. We must leave now, <last>."`
			`	The vault is shaken by the deep and distant sound of something breaking. Your translation device seems to be mostly back to normal, but something isn't quite right, as if it's trying to reshape some deep environmental noise in the background. It's hard to concentrate. There's another blast of sound, and you follow the three Successors back up the tunnel. It seems even longer now than it did before.`
			`	Just as you emerge into the sunlight, something slams into the ground in the distance and you are thrown onto the stone. As you get back up, you hear Ijaset shouting a word that your translation device can't translate. A couple of seconds later, you see what it was that knocked you down: a brilliant stream of plasma illuminates the sky as a hypervelocity projectile strikes one of the buildings in the city. The air stinks of ozone.`

Its shields flash as they shatter the projectile, the shards of which tear through a swath of columns to your left. As you dash aboard the landing ramp with the Successors right behind you, another impact knocks your vessel to the side and you prepare to fly into orbit while your ship's shields still hold.`

			`The <ship> settles down in one of the metal bubbles of the <planet> spaceport and before long, as the ground crew is unloading your ship's cargo, a pair of House Myurej's soldiers comes to lead you through the facility. They take you to an elevator outside of the spaceport's public area; you step in, and a few seconds after it begins moving, it clears the bulk of the spaceport complex and shows you a fantastic view of the planet's ocean as it descends deeper into the water. Unfortunately you're on the wrong side of the planet to see the "Ribbons of Iret," but even the relatively dark sea is impressive in its scale and in the vastness of the underwater infrastructure the Successors have built within it.`
			`	Eventually the elevator nestles into a complex on the seafloor, and the two guards guide you through a number of transparent halls to a large central area. Fish swim above you, schooling behind a circular oculus. Another Successor approaches from one of the side corridors, and it is immediately apparent that this is one of Myurej's scions - they are draped in enough red gold and jewels that it's a wonder they can hold their body upright. When they speak, it's not the voice you heard behind the waving screen before, but one that's smoother and more inquisitive.`
			`	"Captain, captain," they say, "thou, Captain, who has brought us such lovely glitterings with such fine loyalty. And through such perilous straits, I hear as well? The knave Riiria, the fearsome guardians of the Shroud... I could not bear to keep myself from seeing thee in the flesh, the flesh that holds all this surpassing strength!"

			`	"Quite so!" the scion says. "They say a - what is it - a 'biped fever' runs through the people since thou arriveth, that all at once all the worlds clamor for stories of artful, noble humans in the heyday of our Predecessors. I did not see the appeal at first, but by thy actions and seeing thee now... there's a certain strange elegance to the few arms, thy incomplete symmetry." They hum briefly. "But forgive me, that's not what we're here for, thou or I." They bow gently. "Myurej M- Khiajsore. I'm a cousin of the one who spoke to thee earlier, behind the veil."`
				goto next
			label unamused
			`	The scion extends a gilded arm, shaking the myriad piercings and bits of jewelry upon it as if to contemplate them. "Oh, thou thinks me materialistic, mayhaps? Yet precious things are only made precious by the pain of acquiring them. The jewels thou brought back from the Shroud have already earned their own stories... as the beginning of a grand project of restoration, maybe, and at least as something totally unique." They hum with satisfaction. "And yet, 'tisn't what we're here for, thou or I." They bow gently. "Myurej M- Khiajsore. A cousin of the one who spoke to thee earlier, behind the veil."`

			`	Khiajsore hums again. It almost sounds like a piece of music; nothing you're familiar with, of course. "Myurej, Myurej, Myurej," they say. "For the rest here, Myurej is the state, but for those of us within it, Myurej is family. Were we the ones making up this crisis, I surely wouldn't tell thee, discreet as thou may'st have proven thyself." Jovial pastels color the scion's gilded body. "Soon enough, we the Houses shall promise thee all sorts of trinkets - ships and technologies - as our inhibitions fade in this ongoing disorder. Our judgment will be turned to new aims."`
			label stop
			`	Khiajsore stops in a circular room where the flowers have spread out to colonize the space, dusting the air and water alike with their bright pollen. "I wish to invite thee to our wedding, Captain. Not mine!" they chuckle, "but Myurej's. 'Twill take place here, beneath the waves, as our kind once began in eons past. And it shall be a gathering of the Houses, of everyone of import. If thou hast made allies of others, as thou hast of us, there would be the place to petition thy case to all assembled. And," they add with a bright tone, "I do hope thou wilt enjoy the show."`
			`	They glide over to one of the walls and pluck one of the flowers before returning and offering it to you. The golden bloom rotates to face you as you take it from them, opening wide to reveal its bright interior. "Farewell now." they say, "The complex here shall meet thy needs, if thou requireth rest or aught else before thou must depart. May next we meet be as delightful as today, Captain." Khiajsore bows gently once again, and they are joined by their two escorts as they slither down one of the complex's corridors.`
			`	When, a while later, you take the elevator back up to the planet's surface, you cannot help but notice how similar the window into the dark ocean is to Myurej's shimmering black screen.`
