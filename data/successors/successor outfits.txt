	description "At their peak, the Predecessors were feared not by how quickly they could overpower their enemies, but by how effectively they could outlast them. Many generations later, this philosophy is still reflected in modern Successor shield cortices, which are exceptionally powerful for their size but weaken the shield's resistance to incoming fire. This allows Successor ships to recover quickly from sustained damage, even if they are slightly more vulnerable to it."

	"unplunderable" 1
	description "While projectile weapons of this scale are considered obsolete in human space, having been superseded by laser weaponry, the Successors' generations of experience with high-power kinetic weapons have allowed them to produce this particularly terrifying railgun rifle, firing projectiles capable of piercing body armor and even intervening bulkheads. Particularly effective at repelling boarders, it is capable of interfacing with a Successor ship's computer and surveillance systems, routing target information to a built-in display."
