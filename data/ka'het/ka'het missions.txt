			`	You find Taely inside one of the outer hangars of the shipyard, apparently teaching a small group of people how to make basic repairs on an Albatross. You sit on a bench waiting for her to finish her lesson, after which she walks over to you. "Hello, <first>!" she says. "Is there something I can help you with?" `
			`	"I'm here because I need to ask you a few questions," you reply.`
			`	As she sits near you, you start explaining to her the area you reached, including the weird alien ships that attacked you with weapons similar to the ones the Remnant possess, although this doesn't seem to be news for her. "We know of the existence of the Ka'het, the aliens you encountered, since we first reached the Ember Wastes. We found many of their shells within our planets, crashed there thousands, perhaps even tens of thousands of years before our arrival, but some of their outfits survived long enough for us to reverse engineer these advanced technologies."`
			`	"Then," she continues, "a few hundred years ago, a scout fleet arrived in a system where some Ka'het were still alive. They attacked our fleet instantly with EMP Torpedoes that quickly disabled two Starlings. The Starlings couldn't recover quickly enough to survive, and the only remaining ship could do nothing but flee as soon as possible."`

The shells we found had similar capabilities to the quantum keystone, meaning they could pass through the wormholes, so we don't know for sure why they remained in the Graveyard. Perhaps they aren't aware of their skills, or maybe they lost them over time."`

			`	"Back then we found large numbers of their EMP torpedoes, most of which were in nearly pristine condition; their internal mechanisms were also simple enough that we were able to reproduce them perfectly. We couldn't do the same with the other surviving systems in the shells, but their tech has been a source of inspiration for centuries."`

			`	"You see, <first>," she says, "the Ka'het aren't normal spaceships. The debris we found were artificial exoskeletons, built around huge living beings; it's unlikely a species that big could have developed that sort of technology, so we presume someone must have created it for them. This could have happened in the Graveyard, since it's the only place where we know them to live in, but we have such limited data about that section of space that we can't say for sure." As she finishes talking, one of the people Taely was talking to earlier comes closer and shows her something on a touchpad. "I have to go now, Captain," she tells you. "Good luck."`

It barely uses any energy at all, but you can feel the air around it starting to get slightly colder.`

Their space is still populated by the Ka'het they gave birth to through the immense facilities they assembled, a being that does not yet possess a vast intelligence."
