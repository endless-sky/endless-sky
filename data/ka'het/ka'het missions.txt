			`	As she sits near you, you start explaining to her the area you reached, including the weird alien ships that attacked you with weapons similar to the ones the Remnant possess, although this doesn't seem to be news for her. "We know of the existence of the Ka'het, the aliens you encountered, since we first reached the Ember Wastes. We found many of their shells within our planets, crashed there thousands, perhaps even tens of thousands of years before our arrival, but some of their outfits survived long enough for us to reverse engineer these advanced technologies."`
			`	"Then," she continues, "a few hundred years ago, a scout fleet arrived in a system where some Ka'het were still alive. They attacked our fleet instantly with EMP Torpedoes that quickly disabled two Starlings. The Starlings couldn't recover quickly enough to survive, and the only remaining ship could do nothing but flee as soon as possible."`

Perhaps they aren't aware of their skills, or maybe they lost them over time."`

			`	"You see, <first>," she says, "the Ka'het aren't normal spaceships. The debris we found were artificial exoskeletons, built around huge living beings; it's unlikely a species that big could have developed that sort of technology, so we presume someone must have created it for them. We call them the Builders. After we lost the first scout ships in the Graveyard, the prefects decided that we should continue to scout the region but take necessary precautions. Thanks to those protocols, some of which are still applied today, we were able to extensively explore most of the Graveyard and decipher a good amount of the written language we found. There is still much we have yet to discover." You discuss the Graveyard with Taely for a while longer until one of the people she was talking to earlier comes closer and shows her something on a data pad.

Had they found out how to stabilize it and use it as a wormhole, perhaps their species would have survived and spread to the rest of the Ember Waste.`

		add description `	This moon was also home for the second Ka'het wave, which, same as the first, refused to obey their creators. It had been terraformed to make it a more appealing place to live, but after their civilization collapsed the moon began to return to its natural state. When it reverted to its original sub-zero temperatures, the facilities stopped working, and the Ka'het production in this site came to an end.`

		add description `	For most of the thousands of years that passed between the time their discovery of spaceflight and their extinction, Osaeli was the de facto capital of the Builders, a key part of their economy and society. The first Het station was constructed orbiting this planet's star with the purpose of protecting them from any external threat.`
	planet Palarei
		add description `	Thanks to their earlier exploration vessels, this was where the Builders encountered the first lifeforms that evolved outside of their home planet. While the climate was drastically different for the Builders, the fruits the local flora produced were popular enough that Palarei became a major farming planet.`
	planet Parii'het
		add description `	Parii'het was almost finished when the invasion broke out, and already capable of creating Ka'het. Thanks to the mining on Alix and the occasional asteroid mining operated by the Mar unmanned vessels, most of the facilities are still fully operational to this day.`
	planet Retilie
		add description `	As it was mainly used for fishing, the settlements on this planet were never as advanced as the ones on nearby worlds, so when the Ka'het arrived, there was basically nothing to stop them: after a few attacks, the planet was uninhabited again.`
	planet Seli'het
		add description `	This was the only Het station the Builders ever completed, orbiting Giribea. As the young Ka'heta reach their "Age of Assembly," strange, lanky machines start molding an exoskeleton onto their bodies right away. As the Ka'heta grow, their exoskeleton is expanded and various outfits are added, transforming them into living weapons.`
	planet Siteria
		add description `	This was the Builder homeworld, both the place where their journey began and where it ended. After a dozen millennia of underpopulation, the Ka'het arrival forced them to retreat. As one of the few remaining planets capable of sustaining farming, this was their last stronghold, falling centuries after the invasion begun.`
