	description "Eons ago, the Builders were attacked by alien ships which used weapons that ignored their hull and damaged their reactors. Although they never did recover any of these weapons, after years of research they managed to replicate their effects."

# Cooling:

	"active cooling" 32
	"cooling energy" 3.1
	description "While the cooling on a typical ship only needs to worry about keeping the crew comfortable in certain areas, the entirety of a Ka'het ship needs to maintain a suitable temperature for the Het inside to survive."

outfit "Ka'het Shield Restorer"
	category "Systems"
	cost 138000
	thumbnail "outfit/ka'het shield restorer"
	"mass" 15
	"outfit space" -19
	"shield generation" 1.02
	"shield energy" 2.04
	description "The Builders never relied much on shield matrices, preferring instead to strengthen their hull. The reality of war, however, required that the Builders to develop strong shield technology, leading to some Het vessels making extensive use of this module."

# Power:

	"mass" 20
	"outfit space" -22
	"energy generation" 3.8
	"heat generation" 5.8
	description "The Builders originally created this magnetohydrodynamic generator as the Ka'mar main power source. Similarly to what happened with many Mar devices, it was later reused in the Het ships as a secondary energy generator, supplementing their integrated power systems when they proved to be unsatisfactory."

outfit "Ka'het Reserve Accumulator"
	category "Power"
	cost 27000
	thumbnail "outfit/ka'het reserve accumulator"
	"mass" 2
	"outfit space" -3
	"energy capacity" 600
	description "This tiny battery was developed for use by the Ka'mar drones as an emergency energy storage, in case their generators can't quite suffice for the high power demand of most Builder systems."

# Engines:

outfit "Maeri Engine Nacelles"
	category "Engines"

	"flare sound" "plasma medium"
	"steering flare sprite" "effect/ka'het flare/large"
		"frame rate" 30
	"steering flare sound" "plasma medium"
	description "The Ka'het engines are peculiar in that they need to be continuously charged with large amounts of energy: while this means that less power remains available for other subsystems, it is also somewhat more efficient than most types of propulsions, and generates only a tiny amount of heat."

outfit "Ka'het Sustainer Nacelles"
	category "Engines"
	"cost" 357000
	thumbnail "outfit/ka'het sustainer engine"
	"mass" 27

	"flare sound" "plasma small"
	"steering flare sprite" "effect/ka'het flare/medium"
		"frame rate" 30
	"steering flare sound" "plasma small"
	description "While Ka'het vessels are already equipped with proper engines, most of them use a sustainer engine in addition to give the ship enough maneuverability to be useful in combat. Following the same design as its bigger cousins, the sustainer needs constant energy to maintain its thrusters and steering."

outfit "Telis Engine Nacelles"
	category "Engines"
	"cost" 1372000

	"mass" 81

	"steering flare sprite" "effect/ka'het flare/large"
		"frame rate" 30
	"steering flare sound" "plasma medium"
	description "These nacelles used to comprise the entire engine block of a Telis'het. While their size is not impressive compared to other engines, if used in conjunction with a sustainer or two, they can be a powerful form of propulsion, combining both turning and thrusting engines in one."

outfit "Ka'het Compact Engine"
	category "Engines"
	"cost" 172000

	"flare sound" "plasma small"
	"steering flare sprite" "effect/ka'het flare/medium"
		"frame rate" 30
	"steering flare sound" "plasma small"
	description "This tiny engine was developed as the main propulsion of the Ka'mar drones, long before the Ka'het were created and their nacelle design standardized. Improvements over time allowed it to maintain a comparable efficiency to the larger models, although unlike those, it requires some energy to activate the engines in addition to the constant energy drain that all Builder-designed engines have."
