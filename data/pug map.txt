planet "Pug Wormhole"

planet Ruin
	attributes uninhabited
	landscape land/hills3
	description `This is a stormy, cloud-covered planet, where fog banks flow through the valleys like dark, cold, slow-moving rivers, and the sun is seldom visible. Aside from some dull blue-grey moss and lichen, there are few living things here. The ground is warmer than the air above it, due to an abundance of radioactive elements in the planet's crust.`
	description `	Most of the surface is ocean, but atop one of the higher mountains is an odd, abandoned spaceport.`
	spaceport `Perhaps the oddest thing about this planet is this spaceport: a ring of landing pads surrounding a collection of fuel tanks. The landing pads are not cement or any other material humans customarily use, but monolithic slabs of basalt. One of the fuel tanks has a human-style connector on it, but there are a dozen other connectors branching off from it as well.`
	spaceport `	A few insectoid robots scuttle slowly across the tanks and landing pads, removing ice and rust and lichen and polishing the surfaces of the tanks. No living creatures are present.`
