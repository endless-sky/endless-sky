"If a ship has turrets, your Sparrow can't get close enough to hit it with your guns without being damaged, and then it's just a matter of whose weapons and shields are stronger. And one heavy rocket hit could nearly disable you. Also, if it has anti-missile turrets, you can't count on hanging back and bombarding it with missiles from long distances, or at least not with weapons that can fit in a Sparrow. So, don't risk it. It's like rock paper scissors; recognize what your enemy's strengths and weaknesses are, as well as your own."`

After the ship has landed he comes out, no longer in the grease-stained coveralls he's been wearing up until now, but in a suit. As a lifelong textile worker, you automatically note that the suit is made of real wool, very finely woven, and that it has been tailored to fit him. He smooths down the front of the suit distractedly and then looks at his hands as if unsure of where to put them. "How do I look?" he asks.`

The worlds down there don't bring in as much tax revenue as the Paradise Worlds do, so the Navy tends to ignore them.
