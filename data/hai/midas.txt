You wonder what that could mean... surely nothing to worry about. Most outfitters are not real 'connoisseurs' of the value these hold however, and would not give you any more than the price of brute gold for it."

	description "This ship was designed to repel raiding ships, near the end of the Korath war. While it would not be able to defeat one of their ships alone, and would struggle in a prolonged fight, its energy weapons and drone support allow it to hold its own until reinforcements arrive."
	description "	The prototype was stolen after the raids and that this ship design was never produced again, given it would be of little use in the Unfettered conflict. Nowadays the Antlion is renowned for attacking vulnerable targets and disappearing before anyone can react, as if always one move ahead."
	# hint at multiple of them/projections being used
	description "	Some say it has already been beaten, but it keeps coming back, taking all by surprise and sometimes even somehow managed to strike multiple enemies at once."

	description "The Sea Scorpion was designed to serve as a mobile platform to launch Trackers from. After decades of hard work, the Unfettered are finally able to mass produce them. The ever-growing fleet of Sea Scorpions enables the Unfettered to employ new tactics against the other Hai which alleviate some of their numerical, technological, and logistical disadvantages."
	description "	This version was built from stronger materials, allowing for a stronger hull at the cost of heat dissipation. The owners also made modifications in order to make this ship more agile and flexible, with increased fuel and engine capacity. It is a terror on the battlefield, using its speed and high damage of the Tripulse Shredders to its advantage."
