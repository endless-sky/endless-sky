Based on chemical composition, these particles seem to be coming from the jump drive - it must be malfunctioning, but I have no idea in what way it is. This Auxiliary is no joke - it has room for over 100 crew members, so be sure to have what it takes to capture it. You could always disable it and then come back later to board them; but in that case, make sure to be quick, or else the Alphas could repair it." You remember it also had fighters accompanying it.`

I wonder what kind of weapon can do that." She looks intrigued, and pauses to think about it, then continues, "That would explain why it's forbidden for us to venture east with jump drives. We lack any hull repair capabilities, and to be honest with you, our hull is not much more resilient than the one of some human ships, like that Auxiliary."`

			label information
			`	"Obviously, this amount of damage has consequences. It looks like they've quickly patched it up, so it won't affect their hull resistance to weapon's fire. However, this is interesting," she says, pointing out particles on her pad you have not seen before. "Another captain found weird particles in that same system. We've never found traces of those particles before. I guess it could mean a shot got through and did some damage to one of the jump drives they are carrying - maybe even the one they use to jump. One thing is certain: these particles are not left by normal human ships, or Hai for that matter. My best guess would be that when the ship jumped, the hole it left behind did not close as quickly as it should, and anti-matter came from the other side. Perhaps it left these peculiar particles when being annihilated by contacting matter. Or maybe the particles just came through the opening in space?`
			`	"It doesn't matter much anyway. I suspect that they would have gone back to their base to at least take a look at it, so there should be traces leading to it. Something bothers me about this: from our experience, jump drives either work or explode. Maybe it's because the jump drive is not actually being used, and is only leaking particles passively, that this is possible? Or maybe the damage done by these weapons is really special. After all, they are more advanced than what we have, or what the aliens up north possess. Only the Quarg and Korath have a similar level of technology, and those are the races that are rumoured to have invented the jump drives, so it could be some of these weapons are intended to disrupt it specifically."`
			label agree
			`	You were ready to go, but she seems to have something more to say. "Oh, and one last thing before you leave: the base is probably far away, so I would advise taking some fuel pods, especially considering the damage left on the Auxiliary means you will probably not have much time to wait to fuel up from the local stars either, and you should be ready to jump between systems as fast as possible. Also, be prepared for a fight in space, as well as within the ship itself, to claim it."`

The Korath did not always raid us, there was a time of peace. That peace ended when they asked for our help in their war, and we declined... Now, like then, these ones need our help. They should be considered assets at the very least, not prisoners. They could help us against the soulless killers."`

Heading that way, you find a brig full of Korath slaves, with a lizard head displayed above the cells.

They do not look to be in a state to talk about anything though, so you should probably take them to Darkcloak and talk to the Chiefs about this. Hopefully the Korath will have recovered by then.

The Alphas seem to often communicate using simple symbols for their logs as a primitive code, on top of the more serious encryptions used for sensitive information. Going deeper into these recent logs of activities, you find a monkey symbol, with an eye. But it is not all, there is a symbol of a crossed portal, with a red skull icon.`

These logs probably contain indications of where they have been getting the jump drives, but analyzing all of them will take more time.

For instance, if you have time to choose, a quick decision does not make sense, and a wrong decision is hard to [justify, forgive]. Likewise, when time is of the essence, one must learn to [act, react] quickly or be overwhelmed by the actions of others. I named this ship in her honor and I have a statue of her in my war room because I follow her [teachings, legacy].

			`	"As you have probably noticed, the hull is not standard Hai colors. It is, partly, a matter of taste, but the biggest reason is that this ship was built out of the wreck of an old Korath [raider, warship]. Those materials are more sturdy than normal Hai ones, which is why this ship is so [impervious, resilient] to hull damage. However, it comes at the cost of cooling efficiency."`

			`	"Many years ago, when the Korath attacked us, they used a [ghost, fantom] ship. It would attack the [convoys, defenceless], and then disappear without a trace. There was no jump, no flash, nothing. It was just gone. Then, once our warships would depart it returned, always [harassing, plundering] us. The ghost managed to take on countless of convoys and escorts without issue, using its superior [technology, weaponry] and tactical advantages. But it was no real ghost. Everyone has a weakness. Its weakness was that while we could not see it, it did not mean that it was [not there anymore, gone]."`
			`	"With this in mind, the brave Unfettered laid a trap for the ship. When it [disappeared, cloaked], they stopped shooting like usual and acted in distress, making the ghost [arrogant, overconfident]. When it reappeared and moved toward the convoy, we were ready. The fleet arrived and blocked its [escape, cloaking]. The ghost ship disappeared, but it was too late. One of the convoy ships nearby [rammed, crashed] into it, which costed the life of the proud captain but revealed the ship. Then it was just a matter of [shooting it down, damaging it]. The cloaking device was damaged in the fight, or maybe it was already damaged before, knowing the ship never [disappeared, cloaked] for long, so we could not extract it from the wreckage. Instead, we built a ship based on that wreckage's materials, and the [damaged, incomplete] cloaking device remained installed."`
			`	"When you gave me the cloaking device, I started the preparations to install it on my ship, but it was not ready yet. It needs to fully [replace, overwrite] the old system, and that one is well integrated into the ship, so we may have to simply disable it if it cannot be replaced. The engineers are doing all that they can, but it is advanced technology we know [almost nothing, little] about."`
