Word has traveled ahead of you through the new message links, and you are greeted by a hastily planned celebration in the capitol. After a few hours involving a brief formal parade, a great deal of cheering, some minor speeches with Xilin and Alondo trotted out to reassure everyone that there would be no conflict, and finally some more discrete parties outside the public eye, General Choot'k comes to you and Teeneep to bid his farewell.`

			`	You're nursing the warmth of a beverage after breakfast the next morning on far too little sleep when your communicator pings. When it turns out to be Sayari, you take a moment to thank your body clock for ensuring you were already dressed and decent today, despite the suffering over it.`

"As one final thing, we all need to go and meet the human leaders on Mountaintop and finally close the book on this chapter. We could take any ship at this point, but I cannot overstate how much you've helped us. I thought you might like to see it through to the end.`

			`Arriving on Mountaintop, you see the station has seen serious renovations including a grand ballroom, all manner of diplomatic suites, and a notable lack of movie props. Rather than actors and stage crew, you see many familiar and unfamiliar people in full diplomatic regalia, and dress uniforms laden with medals abound on all sides. The Chancellor of the Free Worlds and President of the Republic are in their most respectable suits, while Alondo and Xilin have the traditional symbols of office (though Alondo's looks like the Free Worlds have perhaps not finalized their design just yet). You appear to be a guest of honor, occasionally being called upon to answer idle queries from people seeking clarity on one point or another but otherwise left to yourself. As you mingle with those taking a break from their duties throughout these preliminary meetings, you notice Remington and Terry are conspicuously absent.`

			`	At one quiet point between structured meetings, during which the peripheral conversations are more focused on the particulars of the Free Worlds' position, you manage to get a hold of Xilin to ask about it. He explains the Syndicate's absence. "The Syndicate is technically part of the Republic and awarded no special diplomatic status. Besides, Terry seems to have disappeared from Syndicate communications, though I won't hazard a guess as to their internal politics."`
			`	Perhaps seizing on the opportunity to get a momentary reprieve from more official business, the President himself steps in to fill the gap as soon as Xilin departs. It seems that you acquire a bubble of space around you whenever anyone of note stands next to you, and the President exploits this. "You know," he says quietly, while staring out at the many people hustling about at their business, "it's not very often that someone has the gall to patronize me to my face... I usually have to pay people to do that, or at least, to do it constructively anyway."`
			`	The pause he leaves between sentences is just slightly too short to invite a response. "If you ever decide on a career change, that might be an option for you."`
			`	He exhales through his nose as if chuckling at something humorous. "Fly safe, Captain; a lot of people know who you are now."`
			`	With that he steps away directly to meet an aide who had been hurrying towards you both, intent on ignoring the bubble. From across the room you catch Xilin with his eyebrows raised, giving you a curious look despite being engaged in his own conversation. Neither of them speak to you again for the remainder of the meetings.`

			`	Eventually you follow the diplomats to a room called the Grand Borealis Chamber, "Where Mountains Touch The Sky," as Teeneep makes the first publicly broadcast speech from the Hai to humanity. The three heads of state announce a resolution granting safe passage to all Hai in human space, as long as they register with customs on Mountaintop before entering, and Teeneep expresses similar sentiments for humans visiting Hai space. It is announced that extensive surveillance fleets will be posted on both sides of the wormhole to ensure safety. This meeting will now turn into a multi-day summit to discuss the creation of a formal treaty.`

			`	"For the moment," says Sayari, "We're the only ones who know about it. The Hai are in hiding but have tapped into a communication grid. I intercepted their transmission as it was routed through this station directly."`
			`	Xilin looks at you pointedly. "We need you to go pick them up and bring them here. While you're at it, make sure there aren't any loose ends. If there are, this resolution may not happen, despite everything we've achieved."`

Now that the Hai are entering public relations with human governments, this station has come into its own. A wide concourse facilitates social and business exchanges, as well as parades and demonstrations.

Eventually, a woman landed next to us in this ship here," he explains, gesturing at the Star Barge. "She had them ferry us and all our stuff out to this ship, and then she took charge and flew off with them. That was when we sent the message. We were partly afraid it was some kind of elaborate trap when we saw that we could communicate to a Hai address directly. We never used to be able to communicate between human space and ours like that. I guess we were lucky this time."`

There's no apology appropriate for it, and I can't pretend it would be totally sincere on that front. War changes things; sometimes some pain in the short term is needed for a better future.`

			`When you return to <planet>, you reassure Sayari and Xilin that there is nothing more to do. The danger is over, for good.`
			`	As it happens, the summit has functionally concluded by the time you return. In fact, diplomats had been running interference to prolong things, knowing that your return could potentially have critical consequences. Now that you're here, the remaining agenda items miraculously get resolved within hours, and late in the day, you find yourself once again "Where Mountains Touch The Sky," as the successful resolution is announced.`
			`	The historic moment lays the groundwork for a future official treaty framework and governmental cooperation, as well as establishing <planet> as the principle diplomatic embassy for both peoples. Less publicly, extensive surveillance fleets are posted on both sides of the wormhole to detect any kidnappings or other illegal travel. Now, the only way for illicit transfers to happen is if a government employee is involved, but all three countries have quietly agreed to watch for that behavior and punish it severely.`
			`	At last, it really is over, and you can get back to your own life.`
			`	Maybe you'll have to find out who the Unfettered were stealing their other technologies from. They mentioned another group: the "Wanderers."`
