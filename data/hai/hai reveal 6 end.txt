Word has traveled ahead of you through the new message links and you are greeted by a hastily planned celebration in the capitol. After a few hours involving a brief formal parade, a great deal of cheering, some minor speeches with Xilin and Alondo trotted out to reassure everyone that there would be no conflict, and finally some more discrete parties outside the public eye, General Choot'k comes to you and Teeneep to bid his farewell.`
			`	He shakes your hand and says, "You're a fine warrior, Captain <last>. You are as much a True Hai as any human can be, and it was an honor to fight alongside you in battle."`
			`	Then he turns to Teeneep and tells her, "You're the future leader of all our people, Teeneep. Come back with me to Darkcloak. Join the True Hai and lead us to victory."`

When it turns out to be Sayari looking at you from the screen you take a moment to thank your body clock for ensuring you were already decent today, despite the suffering over it.`
			`	"So glad to see that you've pulled up alright this morning," she says, "as one final thing, we all need to go and meet the human leaders on Mountaintop and finally close the book on this chapter. We could take any ship at this point, but I thought you might like to see it through to the end."`

Any Hai sent against their will into human space will be recovered alive if possible, regardless of the risk to human soldiers. Human authorities will not change their approach towards regular human pirates and slavery though, citing "unsustainable loss of life."`

The Chancellor of the Free Worlds and President of the Republic are in their most respectable suits, Alondo and Xilin have the traditional symbols of office (though Alondo's looks like the Free Worlds have perhaps not finalized their design just yet), and dress uniforms laden with medals abound on both sides.`
			`	When you ask around you find out that Terry is not invited to such an event, as the Syndicate is technically part of the Republic and awarded no special diplomatic status, not to mention that Terry appears to have left the station as soon as she was released at the end of the crisis.`
			`	The station appears to have had work ongoing on it before you arrived, and after a remarkably short time you find yourself standing with the diplomats in the grand Borealis Chamber 'Where Mountains Touch The Sky' as Teeneep makes the first publicly broadcast speech from a Hai to the human media. The three heads of state announce a resolution granting safe passage to all Hai in human space, so long as they register with customs on Mountaintop before entering, and Teeneep expresses similar sentiments for humans visiting Hai space. It is announced that extensive surveillance fleets will be posted on both sides of the wormhole to ensure safety.`
			`	This meeting will now turn into a multi-day summit to discuss and settle upon the appropriate terms of reference and necessary criteria for a full resolution outlining a path to a formal treaty. This process will take a number of days.`

			`Just when you thought that maybe you'd get on with your own life, there's a knock on the door of your station quarters just as you finish breakfast. A slightly sheepish looking Sayari and Xilin are waiting for you when you open the door.`
			`	"We need to talk."`
			`	You feel the deepest of sighs settle into your bones, but at this point you just gesture them inside. It would have been too easy if it was all over wouldn't it?`
			`	"It seems that somewhere along the way a shipload of kidnapped Hai that didn't make it to a processing area, or through the wormhole, got lost. The Hai have been left on Sunracer, and the ship appears to have disappeared," says Xilin.`
			`	"For the moment," says Sayari, "We're the only ones who know about it, the Hai are in hiding and tapped into a communication grid. I intercepted their transmission as it was routed through this station directly."`
			`	Xilin looks at you pointedly, "We need you to go pick them up, bring them here, and while you're at it make sure the threat really is ended. If it's not, this resolution may not happen, despite everything we've achieved."`

No one wants any press on this with the Hai's first public appearance only just days past and still dominating the news cycle. Fortunately a glance at the feeds your ship can pick up on the way in seems to indicate that the government response has taken the wind out of the more sensationalist talking heads, or at least the ones with notable followings.`
			`	The coordinates turn out to lead to a lean-to town built around a Star Barge. The Hai here were unable to all fit on the ship and appear to have built shelters up against it out of the local flora to keep out of the weather. The communicator on the barge must be what was used to send a message. You find a clear space to land not too far away and make your way over.`

			`	He gestures at the Star Barge, "She had them ferry us and all our stuff out to this ship, and then she took charge and flew off with them. That was when we sent the message. We were partly afraid it was some kind of elaborate trap when we saw that we could communicate to a Hai address directly, we never used to be able to communicate between human space and ours directly. I guess we were lucky this time."`
			choice
				`	"Do you know where they went?"`

We have no idea where they went, but we did hear one of them say that they were afraid they wouldn't be welcome there. It sounded like it was out of the way somewhere, wherever it was."`

The wind whips her hair around her constantly and there is a chill here that is only partly the fault of the wind. All of this trouble, all of this death and suffering, everything that was risked between the Hai and humanity. Could this one young woman really have been behind all of it?`

			`	"I know," she says, calm now, "obviously not my intent, but maybe that would have been better in the long-run than the Republic and its corruption. There's no apology appropriate for it, and I can't pretend it would be totally sincere on that front. War changes things, sometimes some pain in the short term is needed for a better future."`

			`When you return to mountaintop you reassure Sayari and Xilin that there is nothing more to do. The danger is over, for good.`
			`	As it happens the summit has functionally concluded by the time you return. The diplomats had been running interference to prolong things in fact, knowing that your return had critical consequences. Now that you're here, the remaining agenda items miraculously get resolved within hours, and late in the day you find yourself once again Where Mountains Touch The Sky as the successful resolution is announced.`
			`	The historic moment lays the groundwork for a future official treaty framework and governmental cooperation, and established Mountaintop as the principle diplomatic embassy for both peoples.`
			`	Less publicly, extensive surveillance fleets are posted on both sides of the wormhole to detect any kidnappings or other illegal travel. Now the only way for illicit transfers to happen is if a government employee is involved, but all three countries have quietly agreed to watch for that behavior and punish it severely.`
			`	At last, it really is over and you can get back to your own life.`
			`	Maybe you'll have to find out who the Unfettered were stealing their other technologies from. They mentioned, "Wanderers."`
