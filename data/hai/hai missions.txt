When humans go on vacation, they travel to a world with perfect weather, sunny every day. When Hai go on vacation, we visit the stormiest world, to find unpredictability and change. Humans are so strange, that to speak with a human is like a small vacation." It smiles, and you catch a glimpse of its massive incisors.

Perhaps each species must consume many worlds and many resources before learning to burn slowly, and the wisdom of the Drak is to allow them to do so.

The captain glances around the deserted spaceport for a while, as if trying to find some other captain, before finally turning to Nanachi and saying, "but I guess beggars can't be choosers. Fine, I'll let you take the cargo there, but please be very careful."`

Maybe since this is a world seeing combat often, they're too busy with military related activities to help a new pilot. She manages to grab the attention of a Hai family leaving a restaurant carrying way too much luggage, most likely tourists looking for a ride back home. Everything seems to be going well until the parents start to look worried. It seems as if they might go away if you don't step in.`

They settle on the pay and the two of you help the Hai get their baggage to Nanachi's ship. When the family is focused on a conversation, you quietly ask Nanachi what the issue she was having with the other people she encountered.`

You name her a few human planets that are extremely populous, and how even some planets with fewer people than this world have incredibly large spaceports.`

"I've seen a bit of human architecture in videos of planets like Allhome, but I can't even imagine what your capital must look like. Tens of thousands of years of another species' history, it sounds even more exciting than what I heard about our landmarks on Hai-home. Captain, do you think that someday, when we no longer need to be kept hidden from humanity, that I'll be able to visit Earth, and see the beauty of your capital?"

If you ever managed to visit you'd be better off going to museums or monuments, but even then there are many thieves roaming the streets and it is very dangerous to be out at night.

I promise I won't mess this up by getting greedy again," She approaches the board on her own, and it becomes clear that it's much easier to get a job here; she's barely started talking to one of the desk workers before receiving a long list of jobs for smaller ships. She is certainly still very tired, but this seems to have cheered her up a bit; it is the first time she can get a job without your help after all.`
			`	While you thought she would've picked one or two jobs quickly and headed back to her ship, she keeps going through them and double checking the information for each one, as if something about them bothers her.`
			`	"What's wrong? Are you struggling to pick between two different jobs?" you ask.`
			`	"These all seem very easy and I could even accept many at a time, but the problem is their pay isn't very good." She grabs some worn papers from her pocket, and shows it to you: they're the documents for her loan. "The bank back home would only give me enough for the ship if I agreed on a short-term loan. I lost two days before you came along to help me, and if I don't get some better paying job soon, I won't even be able to pay the interest."`
			`	As you're trying to figure out a way to get the most out of the available missions, you feel a tap on your shoulder, and turn to see a Hai standing beside a human couple. The couple introduce themselves as Xavier and Vanessa, who are here with their Hai friend Narancia. "We overheard your conversation and are willing to pay a little extra for a job. We're part of a group organizing a big festival in Allhome to celebrate the friendship between humans and Hai, and we just got a last-minute idea: we'd like to get our hands on some Quarg spices."`
			`	Nanachi perks up during their conversation. "I'm sure I can get the spices to <planet> within two weeks. I won't let you down!"`
			`	"That's wonderful," Narancia says. They tell Nanachi that they won't be going along; they already have a transport to Allhome, and will stay here a bit longer to try and advertise the event. "Just come to Allhome after you've picked up the spices. Safe travels!"`

"Captain <last>, Captain Nanachi!" shouts Narancia, beckoning the two of you to join her and the others at their table. You learn that they were inspired by the Hai's own March festival, and wanted to bring small parts of human culture to Hai space.`
			`	"They can't go to our planets and experience it for themselves yet, so we thought about bringing it to them!" Vanessa says.`
			`	"It was very hard to get enough sponsors for this, but after years of hard work we even managed to have famous art pieces be brought here, some of which date back to the European Renaissance!" Xavier adds.`
			`	Afterwards the conversation topic shifts to you as a captain, as you describe your journey after buying your first ship, and how you met Nanachi. You're about to order another drink for the group when a grizzled old man barges into the bar, and starts shouting: "The art convoy has been attacked! The freighter managed to escape but they're stranded on Prime now, and the pirates are still out there, patrolling the route to the wormhole!"`
			`	Xavier stands up with a shocked expression. "How? We had a Leviathan escorting them!"`

It'll take months before the Navy ever notices the pirates there and makes it safe for the convoy to come here. The art exhibition is scheduled three weeks from now!"`
			`	As they try to figure out what to do, Nanachi speaks up. "I'll go there. I pilot a human ship and if we just need to transfer cargo from one ship to the other, I could get out of there quickly. Nobody would notice that a Hai ever went there."`
			`	"Are you insane?" Vanessa says, "If they managed to take down that Leviathan, you wouldn't last a second! Besides, our convoy was extremely fast. If even they were caught your chances of outrunning the pirates are next to nothing!"`
			`	"Captain <last>," Nanachi turns to you. "I know you already helped me way more than anyone would ever be willing to, and I'm really grateful for that, but would you be willing to help me one last time, to get to that planet, and travel back here?" While it's certain that for a pirate fleet to take down a Leviathan so easily they must be incredibly powerful, and this could be extremely dangerous. You're sure that if Nanachi tries to get to Prime by herself she'll just get herself killed.`

				`	"Alright, I'll make sure we reach Prime and get back here safely."`
				`	"No, I agreed to help you find and deal with some simple jobs, but I can't risk fighting such a fleet by myself."`

			`	She thanks you profusely, and promises that she'll pay you for everything as soon as she can. The organizers are a bit hesitant, but seeing as no other captain here has decided to offer them help, they agree to let the two of you go to Prime and retrieve the cargo.`
			`	Vanessa grabs ahold of Nanachi's arm before she can run off to the spaceport. "Just remember, if you can't get back here by <day>, don't worry about it; we'll understand. I'm sure we can come up with some alternative to have the festival without our main attractions."`
			`	As you're leaving the bar, Xavier pulls you aside, speaking very quietly, "<last>, I know you're just trying to help this girl, but don't get killed over this. If you run into those pirates don't try to fight them, just rush to Prime."`

			`	After an hour of watching Remnant eating and gesturing to each other, an androgynous Remnant approaches your table. You try to guess what age they are, but while they do not seem young, neither do they seem particularly old.`
			`	"Greetings, Captain <first>," The stranger signs. "My name is Rayn, and my colleague said you had a request from another faction. It is my understanding that they desire the means to repair the hull of a ship in flight. Is this correct?"`
			choice
				`	"Yes. The Hai are hoping to be able to improve a new carrier they are developing to repair its drones."`
				`	"Yes. The Hai want to be able to repair the hulls of their ships to gain an edge against their enemies."`
			`	"So the Hai want to improve their military technology? I presume this is in response to their long-standing war against the Unfettered?"`
			choice
				`	"Yes, although they don't think of it as such."`
				`	"It isn't a war; it's a defensive action."`
			`	Rayn looks amused. "It does not matter what they call it. A war by any name is just as bloody. But that aside, how do they know about us to make such a request?"`
			choice
				`	"They were looking for someone who had repair technology, and I said I could find someone."`
				`	"They asked if I knew anyone who had in-flight repair technology, and I said I knew a group of human researchers."`
			`	"So they do not actually know about us. That is good." Rayn looks thoughtful and closes their eyes for a moment, then continues. "Pick up the Hai diplomats, but do not tell them where you are going. Take them to these coordinates on Covert in the Gienah system. It is a location in an uninhabited area where we will be able to talk. We will be waiting with something that might be able to help them - if they can meet our price."`

			`At the designated coordinates, there is a small encampment set up that looks vaguely reminiscent of a desert trader outpost. Aside from a few camels tied near a water trough, the place looks abandoned. When you touch down next to it, the delegation steps out cautiously. "Is this the right place?" one of the Hai asks somewhat worriedly.`
			`	Before you can answer, a number of Remnant emerge from the tents, and you notice that Rayn is among them. "Welcome to our encampment, representatives," Rayn chants. "Captain <first> brought us your missive, and we asked them to bring you here. Would you care to come inside?" They gesture toward the largest of the tents. While obviously surprised, Ambassador Yashili acquiesces, and the Hai step inside. Rayn gestures for you to follow. The remaining Remnant begin patrolling around the camp.`
			`	Rayn offers food and water to the Hai and then takes a seat on a cushion on the ground. The Hai politely refuse the food before joining Rayn on the cushions. Ambassador Yashili begins. "We come representing the Hai people, who live far from here. Some of our brothers and sisters have turned violent toward us, and have recently created a new ship that may cause us trouble. We have created a ship of our own in retaliation, but we are still in need of technology capable of repairing the hull of a ship while in flight so that we may have an advantage. Captain <last> has told us that you have such technology, with ship hulls that repair themselves."`
			`	"It is true that our ships self repair," Rayn responds. "But this is not technology that we are able to share. The property is intrinsic to the metals that we build our ships with - metals which are in low supply." Yashili looks concerned with this development; perhaps this journey was a worthless one.`
			choice
				`	"So is there no way that you can help them?"`
				`	"There must be something we could do."`
			`	"Do not fear, for we have something else. For many decades, we have been fighting and plundering Korath raiders from the Core. Their ships contain outfits capable of hull repair through the use of small robots. We have been unable to reproduce these robots with ease, but we may be able to provide for you our research and a number of samples that you may use."`
			`	"We too have encountered these Korath," Yashili says in response. "Although, we had not taken their technology. This may be of great use to us."`
			`	"We would like to ask something in trade, however: a copy of your astronomical records. The history of the galaxy itself is a mystery to us, and we would like to learn more about it."`
			`	Ambassador Yashili looks thoughtful, then nods. "Historical astronomical data is scientifically valuable, as is learning how to repair our ships in flight. This seems a fair trade. We should be able to have the data for you shortly. We only need use of Captain <first>'s ship to access the hyperspace communiation relays." Yashili nods to another member of the delegation, who then scurries off to your ship.`
			`	"I imagine there will be a large amount of data to transfer," Rayn says. "Let us pass the time."`
			`	Ambassador Yashili and Rayn settle into diplomatic small talk. The conversational dance between a group of professional diplomats and a secretive group that are currently playing the role of nomadic desert traders is an odd one.`
			`	"While we wait, I am curious how you met these Remnant, Captain," Yashili says.`
			choice
				`	"I spend much of my time exploring the galaxy. Sometimes you stumble upon interesting things."`
				`	"Well, the same way I'd imagine most people found you - by just wandering aimlessly."`
			`	Yashili nods. "This is an understandable situation."`
			``	
			`	An hour of conversation later, the Ambassador's assistant returns with a large data drive and hands it to her. The Remnant pull out a data chip of their own, and the two groups formally exchange the data. In response to an unseen signal, another Remnant pulls back one side of the tent, and a team carries in a segment from a systems core with several of the small robots. "There are more of these waiting outside, but here is a sample for you to inspect. Using the instructions we have provided, you should have no problem making use of this technology." They poke at the console, and the robots promptly spring to life and assemble a small pile of parts into a model ship.`
			`	"Thank you for doing business with us," says Ambassador Yashili. "You have a friend in the Hai." She bows and the Remnant return the bow with fluid grace before quickly shouldering the Korath equipment. They load everything onto the <ship> as the delegation boards, and you set out to return to <planet>.`
			`	As you take off, a final glance at your exterior cameras shows the Remnant have already almost finished packing up their encampment onto the camels. As one tent comes down, it reveals a anti-aircraft artillery cannon installed on a sled. Despite the rustic appearance they portrayed, the Remnant certainly took their security seriously. There is still no ship visible, but you suspect that a Starling or Gull is undoubtedly hiding nearby.`

They briefly salute you, but appear to be much more interested in the strange new beings you've brought to their center of government.`
			`	The Hai delegation is momentarily confused by the unusual speech pattern the Coalition species have, but snap out of it shortly. The Heliarch then start explaining their story to the Hai, the same they told you when you first met them, including their warning about the Quarg. While both delegations are engaged in conversation, a Heliarch agent approaches you, asking, "To this precious encounter, with what purpose have you brought these people, Captain?"`
			choice
				`	"They're in need of your help."`
				`	"They come seeking technology."`
			`	You start talking to them about the Hai and their conflict with the Unfettered, but as you're explaining you hear a loud collective gasp coming from the Heliarchs that are conversing with the Hai. A member of the Heliarch delegation approaches you. "Captain <last>, kindly telling us about their territory and society, your friend Yashili has. Truthful, is it, that close to the Hai planets, a ringworld the Quarg have constructed?"`
			`	The others seem to be in an excited conversation of their own, after changing their translation devices to no longer speak human. Yashili and the other Hai also turn to you, looking somewhat confused, waiting for you to respond for them.`

				`	"The Quarg are indeed there, but they stay out of Hai business, and the Hai stay out of theirs."`
					goto business
				`	"Yes, the Quarg have a single system there with a complete ringworld, where many Hai and even some humans also live."`
			`	The Heliarchs speak among themselves at a rapid pace, and before you know it several dozen other agents are around. One of them, an older Saryd with a golden circlet, says, "Tell us more about this ringworld, you must, Hai friends. Accompany us, would you?"`
			`	Without waiting for the Hai delegation to answer, they practically drag them to a restricted section of the ringworld without you. About an hour later, the Hai are brought back, most with tired expressions.`
			`	"Had I known we would be interrogated on the engineering aspects and the inner workings of a ringworld, I would have had an engineer come with us," Yashili whispers to you.`
			
			label business
			`	The Heliarchs once again warn the Hai to be careful with the Quarg before finally letting the Hai explain the reason for their trip here.`
			`	The delegation still looks a bit overwhelmed, as if still processing all the history the Heliarch just told them, but Yashili has kept her composure and begins speaking. "We come representing the Hai people, who live far from here. Some of our brothers and sisters have turned violent toward us, and have recently created a new ship that may cause us trouble. We have created a ship of our own in retaliation, but we are still in need of technology capable of repairing the hull of a ship while in flight so that we may have an advantage. Captain <last> has told us that you possess such technology."`
			`	"Developed such technology, indeed we have," an Arach agent responds. "Composed of several dozens of small repair bots, and their center of command, such outfits are."`
			choice
				`	"So are you willing to give or sell one of those outfits to the Hai?"`
				`	"Would you share the way of mass producing those outfits with the Hai?"`
			`	"Much involved in projecting our repair modules, House Chamgar is," the same Arach says. "Contact their representatives in this ring, we will."`
			`	"Do you desire anything in return?" Yashili asks the agent.`
			`	"In return, we ask nothing. Helping you extend beyond the limits placed upon you by the Quarg, enough of a reward is," the Arach responds. Yashili looks somewhat puzzled, but does not press the issue any further.`
			`	A short time later, a group of Arachi representing House Chamgar arrive. They have the Hai describe their ships, using this information to optimize the repair module for Hai ships. They then prepare a copy of the blueprints, handing a data chip containing the schematics for the hull repair modules and their hull-walking robots to the Hai. Some workers then load a crate with two small modules onto your ship for the Hai to use as examples. Yashili thanks the Coalition for their generosity and boards your ship, ready to return to <destination>.`
