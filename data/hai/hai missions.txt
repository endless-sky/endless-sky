Our civilization beyond the wormhole was brought down by infighting and unwise governance. Amid the wreckage we studied and thought and argued and came to believe that we could rule a small territory with stability and peace, or hold more worlds but with constant turmoil. We chose stability, and relinquished those worlds."`

Then the wood becomes coals that burn slowly with no flames or smoke, and when you gather them they are good for roasting meat or even baking bread. Perhaps each species must consume many worlds and many resources before learning to burn slowly, and the wisdom of the Drak is to allow them to do so. But when they find balance, as we did, they no longer need so much space."`

I heard many stories during the war of merchants trying to reach the Hai, but thanks to the Navy being distracted, those merchants fell victim to pirates patrolling the systems of the Far North. Even now, those pirates roam almost unchallenged, and many merchants are trapped here without the means to safely return. They expended most, if not all, of their ammunition trying to get here, and now they have none to defend them on their way back. Human ammunition has become a scarce commodity among human captains in this region of space, leaving open a market that's just waiting to be cornered.`

You see, most of the humans you see flying around in Hai space are flying decades-old ships. Hai ships are prohibitively expensive for humans. The Hai sell the Aphid for nearly one and a half million credits! This means that demand for ships is extremely high among humans, Captain <last>. Do you see where I'm going with this? You look at something we humans sell like a Star Barge, which is hardly worse than an Aphid for only a quarter of the price, and you start to see the problem."`

"It'd take way too long for me to qualify for a loan for even an Aphid, but I recently met a human merchant who wanted to sell his old ship; it was difficult, but I managed to convince him to sell it to me instead of going to the shipyard office.

You approach him and he explains that his ship had some malfunctions and he cannot deliver his cargo of advanced surgical equipment to <destination>. "This is the worst! One jump away from the planet and the navigation system suddenly decides to go on strike! There's no way I can make it before the deadline!"`
			`	"My friend Nanachi here could deliver it for you. We were heading there anyway; a few extra crates won't make a difference," you say, trying to sound as convincing as possible.`
			`	At first, he seems delighted that you two want to help him, but when Nanachi mentions that she's flying a Heavy Shuttle, he frowns, and looks back at the cargo. "Unfettered attacks make it so they need tons of medical supplies on <planet>, and quite frankly I'm not comfortable letting such a fragile ship go into dangerous territory carrying this equipment when it could be blasted to bits in an instant," he says. The captain glances around the deserted spaceport for a while, as if trying to find some other captain, before finally turning to Nanachi and saying, "but I guess beggars can't be choosers. Fine, I'll let you take the cargo there, but please be very careful."`

You watch her go around the spaceport and approach some groups of humans and even other Hai to no avail. Maybe since this is a world seeing combat often, they're too busy with military related activities to help a new pilot. She manages to grab the attention of a Hai family leaving a restaurant carrying way too much luggage, most likely tourists looking for a ride back home.

They settle on the pay and the two of you help the Hai get their baggage to Nanachi's ship. When the family is focused on a conversation, you quietly ask Nanachi what the issue she was having with the other people she encountered.`

She tries to play it cool, but it's clear that she is embarrassed about losing so many potential jobs. When you reach her ship, you take a look at the prices for commodities in <system>. You decide to tell Nanachi to stock up on heavy metals to sell there, to help her make a bit more profit.`

She is certainly still very tired, but this seems to have cheered her up a bit; it is the first time she can get a job without your help after all.`
			`	While you thought she would've picked one or two jobs quickly and headed back to her ship, she keeps going through them and double checking the information for each one, as if something about them bothers her.`

We're part of a group organizing a big festival in Allhome to celebrate the friendship between humans and Hai, and we just got a last-minute idea: we'd like to get our hands on some Quarg spices."`

"Pick up the Hai diplomats, but do not tell them where you are going. Take them to these coordinates on Covert in the Gienah system. It is a location in an uninhabited area where we will be able to talk. We will be waiting with something that might be able to help them - if they can meet our price."`

			`At the designated coordinates, there is a small encampment set up that looks vaguely reminiscent of a desert trader outpost. Aside from a few camels tied near a water trough, the place looks abandoned. When you touch down next to it, the delegation steps out cautiously. "Is this the right place?" one of the Hai asks somewhat worriedly.`
			`	Before you can answer, a number of Remnant emerge from the tents, and you notice that Rayn is among them. "Welcome to our encampment, representatives," Rayn chants. "Captain <first> brought us your missive, and we asked them to bring you here. Would you care to come inside?" They gesture toward the largest of the tents. While obviously surprised, Ambassador Yashili acquiesces, and the Hai step inside. Rayn gestures for you to follow. The remaining Remnant begin patrolling around the camp.`
			`	Rayn offers food and water to the Hai and then takes a seat on a cushion on the ground. The Hai politely refuse the food before joining Rayn on the cushions. Ambassador Yashili begins. "We come representing the Hai people, who live far from here. Some of our brothers and sisters have turned violent toward us, and have recently created a new ship that may cause us trouble. We have created a ship of our own in retaliation, but we are still in need of technology capable of repairing the hull of a ship while in flight so that we may have an advantage. Captain <last> has told us that you have such technology, with ship hulls that repair themselves."`
			`	"It is true that our ships self repair," Rayn responds. "But this is not technology that we are able to share. The property is intrinsic to the metals that we build our ships with - metals which are in low supply." Yashili looks concerned with this development; perhaps this journey was a worthless one.`
			choice
				`	"So is there no way that you can help them?"`
				`	"There must be something we could do."`
			`	"Do not fear, for we have something else. For many decades, we have been fighting and plundering Korath raiders from the Core. Their ships contain outfits capable of hull repair through the use of small robots. We have been unable to reproduce these robots with ease, but we may be able to provide for you our research and a number of samples that you may use."`
			`	"We too have encountered these Korath," Yashili says in response. "Although, we had not taken their technology. This may be of great use to us."`
			`	"We would like to ask something in trade, however: a copy of your astronomical records. The history of the galaxy itself is a mystery to us, and we would like to learn more about it."`
			`	Ambassador Yashili looks thoughtful, then nods. "Historical astronomical data is scientifically valuable, as is learning how to repair our ships in flight. This seems a fair trade. We should be able to have the data for you shortly. We only need use of Captain <first>'s ship to access the hyperspace communication relays." Yashili nods to another member of the delegation, who then scurries off to your ship.`
			`	"I imagine there will be a large amount of data to transfer," Rayn says. "Let us pass the time."`
			`	Ambassador Yashili and Rayn settle into diplomatic small talk. The conversational dance between a group of professional diplomats and a secretive group that are currently playing the role of nomadic desert traders is an odd one.`
			`	"While we wait, I am curious how you met these Remnant, Captain," Yashili says.`
			choice
				`	"I spend much of my time exploring the galaxy. Sometimes you stumble upon interesting things."`
				`	"Well, the same way I'd imagine most people found you - by just wandering aimlessly."`
			`	Yashili nods. "This is an understandable situation."`
			``
			`	An hour of conversation later, the Ambassador's assistant returns with a large data drive and hands it to her. The Remnant pull out a data chip of their own, and the two groups formally exchange the data. In response to an unseen signal, another Remnant pulls back one side of the tent, and a team carries in a segment from a systems core with several of the small robots. "There are more of these waiting outside, but here is a sample for you to inspect. Using the instructions we have provided, you should have no problem making use of this technology." They poke at the console, and the robots promptly spring to life and assemble a small pile of parts into a model ship.`
			`	"Thank you for doing business with us," says Ambassador Yashili. "You have a friend in the Hai." She bows and the Remnant return the bow with fluid grace before quickly shouldering the Korath equipment. They load everything onto the <ship> as the delegation boards, and you set out to return to <planet>.`
			`	As you take off, a final glance at your exterior cameras shows the Remnant have already almost finished packing up their encampment onto the camels. As one tent comes down, it reveals an anti-aircraft artillery cannon installed on a sled. Despite the rustic appearance they portrayed, the Remnant certainly took their security seriously. There is still no ship visible, but you suspect that a Starling or Gull is undoubtedly hiding nearby.`

			`	The Hai delegation is momentarily confused by the unusual speech pattern the Coalition species have, but snap out of it shortly. The Heliarch then start explaining their story to the Hai, the same they told you when you first met them, including their warning about the Quarg.

Truthful, is it, that close to the Hai planets, a ringworld the Quarg have constructed?"`

			`	Without waiting for the Hai delegation to answer, they practically drag them to a restricted section of the ringworld without you. About an hour later, the Hai are brought back, most with tired expressions.`
			`	"Had I known we would be interrogated on the engineering aspects and the inner workings of a ringworld, I would have had an engineer come with us," Yashili whispers to you.`

"We come representing the Hai people, who live far from here. Some of our brothers and sisters have turned violent toward us, and have recently created a new ship that may cause us trouble. We have created a ship of our own in retaliation, but we are still in need of technology capable of repairing the hull of a ship while in flight so that we may have an advantage.

			`	"Developed such technology, indeed we have," an Arach agent responds. "Composed of several dozens of small repair bots, and their center of command, such outfits are."`

				`	"So are you willing to give or sell one of those outfits to the Hai?"`
				`	"Would you share the way of mass-producing those outfits with the Hai?"`

			`	"Do you desire anything in return?" Yashili asks the agent.`
			`	"In return, we ask nothing. Helping you extend beyond the limits placed upon you by the Quarg, enough of a reward is," the Arach responds. Yashili looks somewhat puzzled, but does not press the issue any further.`
			`	A short time later, a group of Arachi representing House Chamgar arrive. They have the Hai describe their ships, using this information to optimize the repair module for Hai ships. They then prepare a copy of the blueprints, handing a data chip containing the schematics for the hull repair modules and their hull-walking robots to the Hai. Some workers then load a crate with two small modules onto your ship for the Hai to use as examples. Yashili thanks the Coalition for their generosity and boards your ship, ready to return to <destination>.`
