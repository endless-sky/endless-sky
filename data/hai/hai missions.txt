When humans go on vacation, they travel to a world with perfect weather, sunny every day. When Hai go on vacation, we visit the stormiest world, to find unpredictability and change. Humans are so strange, that to speak with a human is like a small vacation." It smiles, and you catch a glimpse of its massive incisors.

Perhaps each species must consume many worlds and many resources before learning to burn slowly, and the wisdom of the Drak is to allow them to do so.

			`	"My friend Nanachi here could deliver it for you. We were heading there anyway; a few extra crates won't make a difference," you say, trying to sound as convincing as possible.`
			`	At first, he seems delighted that you two want to help him, but when Nanachi mentions that she's flying a Heavy Shuttle, he frowns, and looks back at the cargo. "Unfettered attacks make it so they need tons of medical supplies on <planet>, and quite frankly I'm not comfortable letting such a fragile ship go into dangerous territory carrying this equipment when it could be blasted to bits in an instant," he says. The captain glances around the deserted spaceport for a while, as if trying to find some other captain, before finally turning to Nanachi and saying, "but I guess beggars can't be choosers. Fine, I'll let you take the cargo there, but please be very careful."`

"So, how did you like your first time doing a hyperspace jump?" you ask, to try and snap her out of it.`
			`	"Oh um, I don't think I'll get used to the feeling anytime soon. I threw up a lot so I'm glad this wasn't a job with passengers. I've always dreamt of being on other worlds, exploring and learning everything about them. I'm glad I'm finally able to do it."`
			`	You help her get the crates out of the cargo hold and contact the client. Nanachi's share of the payment is small, as the client transfers most of the money to the merchant she got the job from, but that doesn't make her any less excited about getting her first paycheck.`

You watch her go around the spaceport and approach some groups of humans and even other Hai to no avail. Maybe since this is a world seeing combat often, they're too busy with military related activities to help a new pilot. She manages to grab the attention of a Hai family leaving a restaurant carrying way too much luggage, most likely tourists looking for a ride back home. Everything seems to be going well until the parents start to look worried. It seems as if they might go away if you don't step in.`

It has enough bunks for us but our sons already caused a ruckus on the way here in a Hai ship, we're worried that since they aren't used to the accommodations, they might end up giving her too much trouble."`
			`	You reassure them that the trip will be very quick, and that the ship's interior is somewhat similar to that of Hai ships, until they finally agree on traveling with her. They settle on the pay and the two of you help the Hai get their baggage to Nanachi's ship. When the family is focused on a conversation, you quietly ask Nanachi what the issue she was having with the other people she encountered.`
			`	"They all seemed willing to give me a job, but I ended up blowing it when I asked for more money. I just really need to get out of debt so I guess I went a bit overboard." She tries to play it cool, but it's clear that she is embarrassed about losing so many potential jobs. When you reach her ship, you take a look at the prices for commodities in <system>. You decide to tell Nanachi to stock up on heavy metals to sell there, to help her make a bit more profit.`

I couldn't get any rest since I had to keep making sure they weren't about to dump their own bags into the void by accident."`

You're still walking toward the job board, when she asks: "Back home I heard stories about how humans have a much larger population than the Hai, and that their home planet has even more people than Hai-home. Is it true that there are many other human worlds with spaceports this large?" You name her a few human planets that are extremely populous, and how even some planets with fewer people than this world have incredibly large spaceports.`
			`	While you tell her stories of many different planets you've visited, she seems to be particularly interested in Earth. "I've seen a bit of human architecture in videos of planets like Allhome, but I can't even imagine what your capital must look like. Tens of thousands of years of another species' history, it sounds even more exciting than what I heard about our landmarks on Hai-home. Captain, do you think that someday, when we no longer need to be kept hidden from humanity, that I'll be able to visit Earth, and see the beauty of your capital?" Seeing how little she knows about humanity, it's not surprising that she is unaware of the state that Earth is in.`

"Despite how much humanity has advanced in the past centuries, Earth has been largely neglected. Most of the land has been turned into cities, which have over the years decayed into slums. If you ever managed to visit you'd be better off going to museums or monuments, but even then there are many thieves roaming the streets and it is very dangerous to be out at night. Lots of folks born there just think about how to get out."`
			`	You keep telling her about the issues facing humanity's birthplace, and her previous eagerness to learn about the planet fades. "How could your ancestors let their own home become like this?"`

			`	"Thanks, but I have to do this on my own. I promise I won't mess this up by getting greedy again," She approaches the board on her own, and it becomes clear that it's much easier to get a job here; she's barely started talking to one of the desk workers before receiving a long list of jobs for smaller ships. She is certainly still very tired, but this seems to have cheered her up a bit; it is the first time she can get a job without your help after all.`
			`	While you thought she would've picked one or two jobs quickly and headed back to her ship, she keeps going through them and double checking the information for each one, as if something about them bothers her.`
			`	"What's wrong? Are you struggling to pick between two different jobs?" you ask.`
			`	"These all seem very easy and I could even accept many at a time, but the problem is their pay isn't very good." She grabs some worn papers from her pocket, and shows it to you: they're the documents for her loan. "The bank back home would only give me enough for the ship if I agreed on a short-term loan. I lost two days before you came along to help me, and if I don't get some better paying job soon, I won't even be able to pay the interest."`
			`	As you're trying to figure out a way to get the most out of the available missions, you feel a tap on your shoulder, and turn to see a Hai standing beside a human couple. The couple introduce themselves as Xavier and Vanessa, who are here with their Hai friend Narancia. "We overheard your conversation and are willing to pay a little extra for a job. We're part of a group organizing a big festival in Allhome to celebrate the friendship between humans and Hai, and we just got a last-minute idea: we'd like to get our hands on some Quarg spices."`
			`	Nanachi perks up during their conversation. "I'm sure I can get the spices to <planet> within two weeks. I won't let you down!"`
			`	"That's wonderful," Narancia says. They tell Nanachi that they won't be going along; they already have a transport to Allhome, and will stay here a bit longer to try and advertise the event. "Just come to Allhome after you've picked up the spices. Safe travels!"`

			`The bar is just as busy as the docks. Many captains here must have transported something for the festival. "Captain <last>, Captain Nanachi!" shouts Narancia, beckoning the two of you to join her and the others at their table. You learn that they were inspired by the Hai's own March festival, and wanted to bring small parts of human culture to Hai space.`
			`	"They can't go to our planets and experience it for themselves yet, so we thought about bringing it to them!" Vanessa says.`
			`	"It was very hard to get enough sponsors for this, but after years of hard work we even managed to have famous art pieces be brought here, some of which date back to the European Renaissance!" Xavier adds.`
			`	Afterwards the conversation topic shifts to you as a captain, as you describe your journey after buying your first ship, and how you met Nanachi. You're about to order another drink for the group when a grizzled old man barges into the bar, and starts shouting: "The art convoy has been attacked! The freighter managed to escape but they're stranded on Prime now, and the pirates are still out there, patrolling the route to the wormhole!"`
			`	Xavier stands up with a shocked expression. "How? We had a Leviathan escorting them!"`
			`	After catching his breath, the man at the door responds. "The pirates must have been stealing Hai tech from ships going back home. The freighter's captain said they shredded the escort!" Chaos spreads amongst the other captains, and the group sitting with you is in anguish.`

				`	"Are those art pieces really that valuable?"`
				`	"Can't you just postpone the festival until the pirates are taken care of?"`
			`	Xavier collapses back to the table, holding his head in both hands. "Those paintings and sculptures were our main attraction! They're worth tens of billions! It'll take months before the Navy ever notices the pirates there and makes it safe for the convoy to come here. The art exhibition is scheduled three weeks from now!"`
			`	As they try to figure out what to do, Nanachi speaks up. "I'll go there. I pilot a human ship and if we just need to transfer cargo from one ship to the other, I could get out of there quickly. Nobody would notice that a Hai ever went there."`
			`	"Are you insane?" Vanessa says, "If they managed to take down that Leviathan, you wouldn't last a second! Besides, our convoy was extremely fast. If even they were caught your chances of outrunning the pirates are next to nothing!"`
			`	"Captain <last>," Nanachi turns to you. "I know you already helped me way more than anyone would ever be willing to, and I'm really grateful for that, but would you be willing to help me one last time, to get to that planet, and travel back here?" While it's certain that for a pirate fleet to take down a Leviathan so easily they must be incredibly powerful, and this could be extremely dangerous. You're sure that if Nanachi tries to get to Prime by herself she'll just get herself killed.`
			choice
				`	"Alright, I'll make sure we reach Prime and get back here safely."`
				`	"No, I agreed to help you find and deal with some simple jobs, but I can't risk fighting such a fleet by myself."`

			`	She thanks you profusely, and promises that she'll pay you for everything as soon as she can. The organizers are a bit hesitant, but seeing as no other captain here has decided to offer them help, they agree to let the two of you go to Prime and retrieve the cargo.`
			`	Vanessa grabs ahold of Nanachi's arm before she can run off to the spaceport. "Just remember, if you can't get back here by <day>, don't worry about it; we'll understand. I'm sure we can come up with some alternative to have the festival without our main attractions."`
			`	As you're leaving the bar, Xavier pulls you aside, speaking very quietly, "<last>, I know you're just trying to help this girl, but don't get killed over this. If you run into those pirates don't try to fight them, just rush to Prime."`
