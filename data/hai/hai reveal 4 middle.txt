We call them microtransceivers. They act together as one big transmitter and receiver, sending and receiving directional messages over great distances."`
			`	"This technology is clearly not of human or Hai origin. It has some similarities to some microbots used in Hai medicine that are used to seal off ruptures causing internal bleeding, but the construction of these  is significantly beyond our science and some materials involved have properties unlike anything we've ever studied up close. Another race's hand has been involved in this technology, a race that has mastered miniaturized technology and is comfortable with its principles."`

				goto questions

			`	A Hai near Teeneep responds. "Yes... and no. Apart from our own people, we're regularly in contact with police. They investigate the disappearances, and sometimes find the missing person. Other times, they eventually have to give up and work on other crimes."`
			`	"Our biggest problem is the lack of help in human space. Local police are generally overwhelmed with crime in the regions where the kidnapping victims are found. There, kidnappings are commonplace. In the areas where the victims were taken, there's virtually no evidence. Your navies and intelligence agencies haven't the time to help us; they're busy cleaning up after the war. There is a lot of unfinished business in Syndicate space they don't want to talk about."`
			`	"Since this problem is tiny compared to the total crime in Hai space, the Hai Elders haven't made it a large priority. They tell me that, if we can prove the kidnappings are from a coordinated effort, they'll put all the resources they can spare into stopping the crime. So far, they say, their investigators have been unable to discover anything."`

			`	You pass through another two grey platform transports and reach a warm cave-like structure with a group of Korath and Quarg.

There are Hai, humans, and reptiles (probably Korath) in the colony, but no evidence of Alphas. However, the scanners could only see the upper three floors due to interference from the planet.`
		conversation
			`Giti turns on the scanning equipment.`
			`	"Okay, let's do the planet first..." Her voice trails off. "Wow! That's odd. We'll need a scanner about ten thousand times more powerful to scan that planet."`
			`	 "I can see a bit of the surface though. The planet is odd in every way. It is completely inhospitable to all known forms of life. There's a huge network of caves and caverns coated with a crystal that is radiating... something the computer can't identify... and deuterium. The denizens of this system siphon the deuterium to make hyperspace fuel. Also, the planet has about a thousand times the mass it should, but somehow the gravity is around Earth normal."`
			`	"Now the moon... hmmm... okay. It's just an ordinary chunk of rock, but the planet's radiation is disturbing the sensors. I can only see a few dozen meters below ground."`
			`	"I found your missing researchers. They're in a facility beneath the moon's surface. There are three different species there: Hai, human, and some kind of reptile." You realize she probably means a Korath. "No Alphas though. I can only see the uppermost part of the facility. They have hydroponics, big cargo bays, docking bays for ships, and some spacious living areas. I detect 1,387 life signs spanning all age ranges, and that's just in the upper three floors of the facility."`
			`	"This isn't a base; it's a colony."`
			`	You notice capital ships heading your way and about two dozen more preparing to leave the planet. It's time to go.`

			`The Earth authorities give you an unusual landing vector that leads to a secret docking bay below ground in Argentina. You land and a Navy cadet meets you at your ship with an urgent message, "Republic Intelligence and a Navy Marshal want to see you as soon as possible. They have news about your microtransceiver transmissions. Please follow me."`
			`	Giti adds, "I'll take the scanners and data to some researchers and let you know when I have more information. Please go with the cadet. It sounds like you'll finally get some answers."`
			`	The cadet takes you to an elevator just outside your ship, down more than three hundred floors to a large meeting room. Within, you see two men and a woman in formal dress. One man has a Republic Intelligence uniform with the name, Agent Kopkow. Another wears a navy full dress uniform that you don't immediately recognize. After a moment of thought, you realize he is Marshal, the second-highest rank in the Navy, answering only to the Grand Marshal. His uniform is is labeled, Adurath Kaine. The woman is a Navy captain wearing the prominent Parliamentary Medal of Valor. Her name label says, "Captain Anna Wallace."`

			`	You've had few dealings with Republic Intelligence, but you know what everyone knows. They're the top police force of the Republic, dealing with high-profile civilian crimes that local authorities can't handle. Murder investigations, interplanetary kidnappings, and the like. They also gather intelligence throughout human space, and possibly beyond, reporting directly to the Republic Parliament.`
			`	There are only five Navy Marshals, and one Grand Marshal; this man's high rank means he reports parliament regularly. People this high in the navy tend to deal more with political issues, rather than combat or strategy, so you wonder why they picked him to talk to you.`
			`	The Parliamentary Medal of Valor is only given to one person per year; this captain must have done something especially heroic. She must also have supporters in Parliament to receive the award in the first place. That will give her some freedom to act independently, like Danforth does.`
			`	The three of them are looking at you confused, wondering why you've stopped and stared at them for a half minute.`

			`	Marshal Kaine introduces himself, "I'm the Marshal of the Third Armada, the guards of the Far North and the uninhabited regions near it. I know you've met one of my admirals, Danforth that is, a good man albeit one who flouts the rules a bit too much." He gives a stern look at Captain Wallace. "Some of my carriers have detected the signals you've found. Actually, we see them quite regularly in the ships of known slave runners. The runners don't always carry slaves; they do other smuggling missions as well."`
			`	Agent Kopkow speaks his piece next, "Sometimes the runners do carry slaves, and we have found humans or Hai in crashed slaver ships. We returned the Hai to their homes, as you did, but they didn't know Republic Intelligence helped them. Several merchants have done the same. About one in seven we rescued were researchers, an extremely disproportionate amount when you consider the number of researchers in human and Hai space. Clearly they're being targeted."`
			`	Kaine continues, "That, unfortunately, is where we have some bad news. Parliament has a strict policy on pirates and slaver ships: destroy on sight. This is a tradition that goes back long before the era of space travel. Raiding pirate ships is a deadly affair; numerous navy or police will be killed. While it may seem heroic, the casualty rate is unsustainable. The only effective way to discourage piracy is to destroy the ships. If you don't believe me, try catching some yourself and count your dead."`
			`	Captain Wallace concludes, "That means many slaves are killed, including some Hai researchers."`
			`	Kaine says, "We informed the Hai government while you were away and they've responded by moving fleets towards the wormhole; we're doing the same. By the time you arrive, there will be large fleets on both sides of the wormhole. This could quickly lead to war. Please take the message back to Teeneep and the Hai victims with our condolences. Captain, please see <first> <last> back to the <ship>."`
			choice
				`	(Return to your ship.)`
			`	Along the way, Captain Wallace tells you stories of Navy heroism and brutality towards slaver vessels. Apparently many officers like her disagree with the Navy's policy. They want to rescue slaves whenever possible, regardless of risk or orders.`
			`	She was awarded for personally leading a charge deep into pirate space to rescue a group of over a hundred high-school students that were captured on a field trip to Shroud. That led to her court-martial and conviction for disobeying a direct order. She was pardoned by the Prime Minister upon receiving the Parliamentary Award for Valor.`
			`	When you reach your ship, she hands you a business card, "Please have the Hai victims talk to this man. He's part of Syndicate Internal Affairs and may be able to help. He and I... share common goals."`
