A few other Hai and human victims are here; they were mostly rescued by other kind merchants in human space, but around half of those here are my staff."`

Perhaps more pertinently though, since we've found those patterns we've been able to reach some of the victims more quickly upon their return, and even rescue a couple ourselves.

			`	Teeneep looks at you as if you were daft. "The kidnappings happen on Hai and human worlds. The kidnappers have no reason to search an uninhabited planet for potential victims. This gives us a safe place to hide any critical people or information. We have reason to believe that if there is a coordinated organization behind this as we suspect, they would have strong reason to track us down and silence some those who have previously escaped, and probably shut us down too. We have plenty of space here to do our work and investigate what we need to without the precautions that would be necessary somewhere more populated."`
				goto questions
			label cadmium
			`	A Hai in a medical uniform explains, "The victims each seem to have been exposed to airborne particulates containing cadmium which must be circulating through their ships ventilation. I should also clarify that it's not strictly 'poisoning'. The level of exposure is quite low, but enough that testing shortly after being rescued does show clearly elevated levels in many who were taken.`
			`	"No known technology of human or Hai origin exhausts anything which could create this effect. There are some microbots used in Hai medicine that are used to seal off ruptures causing internal bleeding, and their dispenser canisters have residual cadmium dust in them as residue, but that's the only thing we even bring onto a ship that uses it, and those are self-contained for disposal and the molecular bonding doesn't match anyway. There are some materials involved have properties unlike anything either of us make, which suggests this is coming from another race's technology."`

			label patterns
			`	Teeneep explains, "I head a large activist organization for social direction and civil rights alignment; we have some resources of our own. We've combed police records for the past few decades and noticed patterns in disappearances."`
			`	"There are violent crimes and kidnappings in Hai space, though much less frequently than in human space. Murder, assault, estranged parents kidnapping their children, all of that happens here. Many of those crimes are solved: the victim is found dead or alive. Some of them are not solved. There are also disappearances that go unreported until long after they occur. Hai who simply get up and decide to go on an adventure one day out of boredom, and then get stuck up a mountain, fall into a crevasse, or any encounter any number of other fatal natural phenomena. Their bodies are sometimes found, but they're usually only hard to find when they're local to the destination with the danger."`
			`	"In recent years a disproportionate number are from the intelligentsia: doctors, scientists, engineers, architects. In particular, they are specialists of some kind in their field, but not prominent enough for the field to be significantly set back by their absence. The same is happening in human space, people with niche skills are occasionally disappearing. In Hai space particularly, some of these disappearances are from world where we would expect to be able to track them to the general area of their disappearance, but instead they are simply... gone. We believe someone is targeting researchers and specialists and trying to hide it beneath the noise."`
				goto questions
			label kidnappings
			`	Teeneep answers, "In human space, we don't know, but after collating records in Hai space it seems to have happened in three spates each lasting several years. The first of which date back to only about a decade after we made contact with humans, though it doesn't seem to have been consistent in either time or method, merely in the type of people targeted. This of course means that we can't even say for sure if it's even been the same people, but every investigation has ultimately dead-ended with similar difficulties."`
			`	"Nevertheless, from the rate at which the disappearances have happened, possibly as many as five thousand Hai have vanished this way. The number may be less; some of those cases may be undiscovered murders, secret changes of identity, or defections to the Unfettered. We have no idea how many humans, we don't have that level of access to your records and they're not that good anyway."`
				goto questions
			label know
			`	Teeneep explains, "The organization I lead has contacts with sympathetic individuals and organizations throughout Hai space. We have enough funding to hire a few hundred full-time employees of our own. Most of them are lawyers, social workers, or administrative employees. A few are investigative journalists or various types of researchers."`
			`	"We've spent the last three years researching this problem, but it helped a lot to meet the people who have been rescued."`
				goto questions
			label anyone
			`	A Hai near Teeneep responds. "Yes... and no. Apart from our own people, we're regularly in contact with police. They investigate the disappearances, and sometimes find the missing person. Other times, they eventually have to give up and work on other crimes.`
			`	"Our biggest problem is the lack of help in human space. Local police are generally overwhelmed with crime in the regions where the kidnapping victims are found. There, kidnappings are commonplace. In the areas where the victims were taken, there's virtually no evidence. Your navies and intelligence agencies haven't the time to help us; they're busy cleaning up after the war. There is a lot of unfinished business in Syndicate space they don't want to talk about.`
			`	"While the crime in Hai space is rather more manageable, the evidence of a pattern just isn't strong enough for the Elders to justify a dedicated task force when more visible priorities still dominate the news feeds. They tell me that if we can prove the kidnappings are from a coordinated effort, they'll put all the resources they can spare into stopping the crime. So far, they say, their investigators have been unable to discover anything though, and there are some cases where there are things about the Elder's responses that simply don't add up, and we presume must be classified for some reason."`
			`	Teeneep nods. "What we need is a skilled pilot with the strength and connections to investigate some locations we cannot easily access... and that pilot needs to be someone we can trust. You are recommended by our mutual friend."`

It surprises you that a gang of pirates would be capable of creating such a base, as the materials and time needed to make something like this are immense.`

			`	The leader turns to the crowd. "How about a fight? To the death!" The crowd erupts in cheers. The leader turns back to you. "We fight in this system only. Just you and me. You attempt to run, my men hunt you down. How's that sound?" You attempt to respond, but before you can, the leader pulls his gun and aims it at you. "Run."`

		conversation
			`You read Teeneep's contact information for Tarazed Shipyards, and it talks about a man named Goraz Zoltof who works in their communications research laboratory. There's an address and detailed information about the man, whose wife went missing under mysterious circumstances some time ago. After a series of shuttles and trains, you reach his house and knock on the door.`
			`	He's a little groggy, but manages to ask, "Yes?" You explain about the microtransceivers, the Quarg, and the kidnappings. You avoid mentioning that some of the people are Hai, just in case he's never heard of them. He seems to awaken immediately. "You found a lead on my wife's disappearance? Yes, I think I can help you. Let's go to my laboratory at once."`
			choice
				`	(Head to the laboratory.)`
			`	After another series of shuttles and trains, you reach what looks like a spaceport. From the extra equipment and unusual ship designs, you realize it is a research shipyard. Goraz's laboratory is an entire docking bay with a modified Blackbird. Despite its size, it is conspicuously absent any other personnel. He takes you on board and, noting your attention to your surroundings, explains that he has few assistants that are typically off-world most of the time as he walks you to the communications room.`
			`	"Here, let me take a look at what you've brought me." He takes the data card you got from the Quarg and plugs it into the communicator. After several minutes of typing and muttering incoherently to himself he pauses as a simulation plays on his screen. You're not sure exactly what you're looking at, but when it finishes he lets out a long slow breath and comments to himself in a low voice. "Bastijn Biesterveld, you absolute legend. He was right - it's the interference."`
			`	He turns back to you and explains. "Normally interference isn't something that's logged, but when you're in civilized space with hyperspace relays, your ship does a final handshake with the local relay station as it jumps. That station sends that handshake signature to the destination station so it knows exactly who you are to be able to reconnect communications at the other end. It's a fully automatic process, and it's independent of ship IDs. It's just buried in there as a check from back in the days when hyperdrives would occasionally explode and we'd need to work out who went missing. It gets logged and automatically overwritten every couple days, and someone would probably have gotten rid of it if it wasn't so deeply baked into the way the system works. If you know when a ship jumped and where it jumped to, you can use it to confirm it didn't blow up; and if there's something wrong with the communications equipment you can use the log info to identify if a specific ship is the same ship talking to you later, but neither of those are particularly useful since the same information can be acquired more easily and in much higher quality through other means."`
			`	He pauses, realizing he's been rambling. "Sorry, that was probably way more explanation than you needed. There's a small group of us comms people that have lost people, or know people who have, that the authorities can't help. We're scattered all over and we've been looking at this ourselves. Together we identified some ships we thought were suspicious, but we've not been able to pin down anything concrete. Bastijn was convinced there was a pattern of interference signatures from the logs; he made the analysis program, but it was never definitively distinct from the noise. Now though, well, what you've given me is a match!"`
			`	He casts around for a moment and then plugs a freshly unpacked data card into his console. "Give me a little time: I can do something for you now. I'll be back with you in ten minutes."`
			choice
				`	(Sit down.)`
				`	(Stand around idly.)`
			`	After some time, in which he looks like he's installing a series of programs, he returns your original data card and the second one, now loaded up with whatever he was putting on it. "Load this new card into one of your communicator's extra data storage slots, preferably the first one. This new card will run maintenance level processes with the communicator to download the logs from the local station when you enter a system, match the log signatures for ships that are in-system, and code up extra info for their ID's. Functionally, they'll show up as 'Smuggler' on your display. You'll have to hunt for them though, cause you'll have to be in the same system as them for any of this to work.`
			`	"Also... maybe keep this quiet. This is," he pauses and clears his throat conspicuously, "somewhat less than strictly legal, though there's no penalty attached to accessing the data at the level this card will use. You should focus your search on the uninhabited areas between the Far North and Syndicate space, plus any nearby pirate systems. That's where we've noticed the most suspicious activity."`
			`	All business and technical explanation now out of the way, you watch as the reality of what's happening seems to suddenly sink in, and his demeanor changes suddenly as his eyes shine with faint hope, "And please, if you do find my wife Janitza... please bring her home."`
			choice
				`	(Return to your ship.)`
			`	After one last ride through the shuttles and trains of <origin>, you arrive at your ship. You plug the data card into your computer, and a new "government" shows up: Smuggler. The ships will be colored differently than pirates.`
			`	It may be risky, but you should disable one and board it.`
			`	Teeneep gave you the name of a contact within a historical archive on <destination>. She wants you to speak to a woman named Giti Gilani if you find one of the smuggling ships. Giti specializes in history of ship designs and space-faring groups, including the Hai.`

			`	When you arrive, Giti tells you, "This is a religious materials archive. Give me a minute here..." Her voice trails off as she starts typing on a terminal. She walks back and forth between several bookshelves skimming books for a few minutes.`
			`	"I found it," she says. "This is a modified version of the Symbol of Baphomet, the official symbol of an older incarnation of the Church of Satan. Contrary to popular belief at the time, they were never devil-worshipers of any sort. Instead, they believed in a sort of rationalist individualism and were one of the first organizations to fund large-scale settlements on Freedom. Since then, the symbol has been co-opted by miscreants.`
			`	"But you didn't come here for a theological history disquisition. The letters around the pentagram have been replaced with galactic coordinates using an archaic notation." She smiles at you, "I wrote my Ph.D. thesis about that notation! Now I finally need that information for something other than getting a degree!`
			`	"The circle around the symbol looks almost like a wormhole. A red wormhole. I heard about one in Terminus near The Deep. Apparently nobody is able to enter one without their ship being torn to pieces. This symbol suggests there's another one in the middle of Syndicate space.`
			`	"Fly through the wormhole at the coordinates on that card, if you can, come back and tell me what you see. In the meantime, I'll ask other researchers about the microtransceivers."`
			choice
				`	(Thank her and return to your ship.)`
			`	Upon returning to your ship, you ponder Giti's findings. The coordinates are for a system in Syndicate space that is not reachable by hyperlane, so you'll need a jump drive. The red wormhole requires another key.`
			`	Once you've passed through that wormhole, hopefully Giti will have more information for you.`

			`	As soon as she sees you she asks, "What did you find out?" You explain your journey to her.`
			`	She responds, "Wait... I... lemme check..." followed by some typing on a nearby terminal. "Yes, you're right. In the late 21st century, there was an effort to map stars in that intergalactic region. By all rights these stars should not have been so visible, but some strange anomaly made that part of the sky clearer for a while. The strangest thing we spotted was not a star; it was some kind of object with unknown properties that confused our scanners. Even today I'm not sure we'd make sense of it, but the anomaly passed, and we couldn't even make an attempt now."`

There's a huge network of caves and caverns coated with a crystal that is radiating... something the computer can't identify... and deuterium. The denizens of this system siphon the deuterium to make hyperspace fuel. Also, the planet has about a thousand times the mass it should, but somehow the gravity is around Earth normal."`

			`The Earth authorities give you an unusual landing vector that leads to a secret docking bay below ground in Argentina. You land, and a Navy cadet meets you at your ship with an urgent message: "Republic Intelligence and a Navy Marshal want to see you as soon as possible. They have news about your microtransceiver transmissions. Please follow me."`
			`	Giti adds, "I'll take the scanners and data to some researchers and let you know when I have more information. Please go with the cadet. It sounds like you'll finally get some answers."`
			`	The cadet takes you to an elevator just outside your ship, down more than three hundred floors to a large meeting room. Within, you see two men and a woman in formal dress. One man has a Republic Intelligence uniform with the name "Agent Kopkow". Another wears a Navy full dress uniform that you don't immediately recognize. After a moment of thought, you realize he is a Marshal, the second-highest rank in the Navy, answering only to the Grand Marshal. His uniform is labeled "Adurath Kaine". The woman is a Navy captain wearing the prominent Parliamentary Medal of Valor. Her name label says "Captain Anna Wallace."`

			`	You've had few dealings with Republic Intelligence, but you know what everyone knows. They're the top police force of the Republic, dealing with high-profile civilian crimes that local authorities can't handle: murder investigations, interplanetary kidnappings, and the like. They also gather intelligence throughout human space, and possibly beyond, reporting directly to the Republic Parliament.`
			`	There are only five Navy Marshals, and one Grand Marshal; this man's high rank means he reports to Parliament regularly. People this high in the Navy tend to deal more with political issues rather than combat or strategy, so you wonder why they picked him to talk to you.`
			`	The Parliamentary Medal of Valor is only given to one person per year; this captain must have done something especially heroic. She must also have supporters in Parliament to receive the award in the first place. That will give her some freedom to act independently, like Danforth does.`
			`	The three of them are looking at you confused, wondering why you've stopped and stared at them for a half minute.`

			`	Marshal Kaine introduces himself. "I'm the Marshal of the Third Armada, the guards of the Far North and the uninhabited regions near it. I know you've met one of my admirals, Danforth that is, a good man - albeit one who flouts the rules a bit too much." He gives a stern look at Captain Wallace. "Some of my carriers have detected the signals you've found. Actually, we see them quite regularly in the ships of known slave runners. The runners don't always carry slaves; they do other smuggling missions as well."`
			`	Agent Kopkow speaks his piece next. "Sometimes the runners do carry slaves, and we have found humans or Hai in crashed slaver ships. We returned the Hai to their homes, as you did, but they didn't know Republic Intelligence helped them. Several merchants have done the same. About one in seven we rescued were researchers, which is an extremely disproportionate amount when you consider the number of researchers in human and Hai space. Clearly, they're being targeted."`
			`	Kaine continues, "That, unfortunately, is where we have some bad news. Parliament has a strict policy on pirates and slaver ships: destroy on sight. This is a tradition that goes back long before the era of space travel. Raiding pirate ships is a deadly affair; numerous Navy or police will be killed. While it may seem heroic, the casualty rate is unsustainable. The only effective way to discourage piracy is to destroy the ships. If you don't believe me, try catching some yourself and count your dead."`
			`	Captain Wallace concludes, "That means many slaves are killed, including some Hai researchers."`
			`	Kaine says, "We informed the Hai government while you were away, and they've responded by moving fleets towards the wormhole; we're doing the same. By the time you arrive, there will be large fleets on both sides of the wormhole. This could quickly lead to war. Please take the message back to Teeneep and the Hai victims with our condolences. Captain, please see <first> <last> back to the <ship>."`
			choice
				`	(Return to your ship.)`
			`	Along the way, Captain Wallace tells you stories of Navy heroism and brutality towards slaver vessels. Apparently many officers like her disagree with the Navy's policy. They want to rescue slaves whenever possible, regardless of risk or orders.`
			`	She was awarded for personally leading a charge deep into pirate space to rescue a group of over a hundred high-school students that were captured on a field trip to Shroud. That led to her court-martial and conviction for disobeying a direct order. She was pardoned by the Prime Minister upon receiving the Parliamentary Award for Valor.`
			`	When you reach your ship, she hands you a business card. "Please have the Hai victims talk to this man. He's part of Syndicate Internal Affairs and may be able to help. He and I... share common goals."`
