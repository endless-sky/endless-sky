Many of the ones who have subsequently been rescued have had mild cadmium poisoning from some technology not of human or Hai origin.

			`You follow the landing coordinates to a flat area of hardened dirt near a cave. A Hai Centipede is parked next to you; it draws your attention immediately as it is equipped with some non-standard human outfits. You can see the emission components of a scram drive sticking out the back, and the collection prongs of a Catalytic Ramscoop. The steering is Hai, but the thrusters are human. The ship appears ready to fly rapidly through unfriendly territory without stopping.`

			`	You walk twenty meters into the cave before coming up to a concrete wall that fills up the entirety of the cavity. An open door passes through to an unmanned security post, until it finally leads into a small and roughly designed underground facility. Through some large windows immediately to the left, you can see a room containing a variety of medical machinery, while off to the right there are computers arrayed around a makeshift living area and some sleeping quarters. You notice that some of the people you've rescued are present, but there are many more humans and Hai you haven't met, some armed with Pulse Rifles. Despite all this, your attention is quickly captured by a Hai woman walking towards you.`
			`	"Greetings Captain <last>, my name is Teeneep Goot'r. I'm a social advocate among the Hai, and I'm trying to help your friends with a problem. As you know, they were kidnapped by humans. A few other Hai and human victims are here; they were mostly rescued by other kind merchants in human space, but around half of those here are my staff." As she speaks she directs you to some seats that are just far enough away from the other people in the room to confer at least the illusion of privacy.`
			`	"My organization has been researching the disappearance of Hai ever since humans began disappearing here under similar circumstances. We've discovered some patterns to these abductions, and through those we've been able to reach some of the victims more quickly upon their return, and even rescue some ourselves. But we have noticed something strange among the abductees: those Hai that you rescued, and several others, too, are all experiencing mild cadmium poisoning."`
			`	Teeneep is your best lead so far on Hai arming pirates, and this may be your only option for information. It's time to ask, but perhaps this calls for a careful choice of words.`

			`	You explain about pirates having Hai weapons, and about a "trusted source" that told you about an entire warehouse of them.`
			`	"That's... worrying, but the Elders are pacifists to a fault, so I can't imagine them doing it. It is more likely that smugglers took it there, or ordinary pilots sold their used Hai gear. Do you have more evidence?"`
			`	After you describe what Sayari said about Hai pirate deals, Teeneep shakes her head and says, "Sayari would put a stop to any weapon deals. I'm sure it's something innocuous, like cash or basic supplies for their anarchist worlds.`
			`	"If you find solid proof that our government is arming pirates, I can, and will, stop them. There are extreme legal maneuvers civilians can use to force the Elder Council to change their minds.`

If there is a coordinated kidnapping effort as we suspect, they would track down threats to the operation, like escaped victims or our organization. We have plenty of space here to do our work without precautions that would be necessary on a populated planet."`

			`	"No known human or Hai ship technology exhausts these particles. There are some Hai medical microbots that leave behind something similar, but not quite the same, and those are microbots are self-contained for disposal. We believe this is coming from another race's technology."`

			`	"First, you must understand that violent crimes in Hai space are not a rare thing, though they aren't a day-to-day part of life as in human space. Murder, assault, estranged parents kidnapping their children, all of that happens here. Some Hai go on an adventure one day and then fall in a crevasse or get eaten by a beast. Some join the Unfettered but don't tell anyone. Most cases are solved: the person is found dead or alive. Sometimes, though, no person or body is ever found."`
			`	"In recent years, a disproportionate number of Hai and human disappearances are from the intelligentsia: doctors, scientists, engineers, architects. Most were specialists within their field. None were prominent enough for their departure to send shock waves in the community though. Some disappeared from worlds where we'd expect to be able to track them to their general area, but instead, they are simply... gone.`

The earliest date back to only about a decade after we made contact with humans, but the circumstances and types of victims varied over the years. This means that we can't even say for sure if the same people are behind it, but every investigation has ultimately dead-ended with similar difficulties."`
			`	"Nevertheless, from the rate at which the disappearances have happened, possibly as many as five thousand Hai have vanished this way. The number may be less; some of those cases may be undiscovered murders, secret changes of identity, or defections to the Unfettered. We don't have the data to make an estimate for human disappearances."`

			`	Teeneep explains, "The organization I lead has contacts with sympathetic individuals and organizations throughout Hai space. We have enough funding to hire a few hundred full-time employees of our own. Most of them are lawyers, social workers, or administrative employees. A few are investigative journalists or various types of researchers."`
			`	"We've spent the last three years researching this problem, but it helped a lot to meet the people who have been rescued."`
				goto questions
			label anyone

				set "Hai Reveal [A02] Symbol Identification: label anyone"
			`	A Hai near Teeneep responds. "Yes... and no. We work with police who investigate the disappearances, and sometimes they find the missing person.`
			`	"Our biggest problem is a lack of help in human space. Local police are overwhelmed with crime in the regions where the kidnapping victims are found. Worse, the kidnappers leave behind virtually no evidence to investigate. Your navies and agencies haven't the time to help us; they're busy cleaning up after the war. The Syndicate has unfinished business they won't talk about.`
			`	"Hai space is more manageable, but our resources are not infinite. The pattern just isn't clear enough yet for the Elders to justify more expenditure. They tell me that if we can prove the disappearances are part of a coordinated kidnapping effort, they'll put all the resources they can spare into stopping the crime. They also say their investigators have been unable to discover anything, but sometimes their responses don't add up. We presume this is because they're blocking our access to classified information."`

				`	"Yes, I have."`
				`	"No, I've never seen it before."`

				`	"Yes, I do."`
				`	"No, I don't remember this symbol."`
			`	She nods. "This symbol was on the key to the crate Gipeep had been locked in. He swiped it and brought it back with you. It has been found a number of times in association with the circumstances where rescued Hai have had some level of cadmium poisoning. We have not been able to identify where it originates from. We must know and seek out who they are and where they are hiding, though I believe our mutual friend will be satisfied with merely the 'who' for now."`
			`	She hands you a data card. "This has as many images of the symbol as we have, and information on where we've found it so far. Perhaps you might find it useful. Think about who you might be able to ask, and follow any leads. If you can find out where this symbol comes from or who uses it, return here, and we will pay you 2,000,000 credits."`

			`	The slightly accentuated formality on 'Remington' is not lost on you, but the Syndicate PR man doesn't react to it as he hands you a datapad displaying a hyperspace relay. "Since this crisis began, the Navy maintained hyperspace relays in Rajak and Hasseleh, linking our communication network to the Hai's through a secure portal. However, while this has allowed us to communicate to anywhere back home, it has some disadvantages. What you see there is the solution.`
			`	"There are fourteen relays between the wormhole and Earth, but that means routing through Elnath or Aldebaran.

			choice

			`	"As I said before, there are fourteen relays between the wormhole and Earth, which is theoretically the same number as there are to Markab, but for us that means routing through Elnath or Aldebaran. Those two relays are owned and maintained by Lovelace Labs, who ferry an enormous volume of data back and forth between those two systems. This means that communications back to the Syndicate tend to either get held up in a buffer waiting on priority data streams that Lovelace reserves for itself, or it gets routed for eighteen links through Sirius, or seventeen through Sol itself. Both of these systems have strained infrastructure with high throughput latencies as it is, even for priority communications. So while Xilin has the highest priority access and the shortest distance and Alondo here has all his comms routing a whole different way entirely, the Syndicate is getting many of our comms held up to sometimes problematic degrees."`
			choice

For a long time the marauders here have been using the communications darkness out this way to do their business with impunity. The sole advantage of these relays is that ships out this way can call for help when they couldn't before. So the relays the Syndicate have been putting up have been getting destroyed, along with several of our security ships.`

He makes eye contact with Alondo and very deliberately emphases the word as he continues, "WE have been working with the Hai to make relays that look human-made, but utilize advanced Hai technology to baffle scanners attempting to find them. They'll form communication links the marauders can't destroy."`

			`	He gives a meaningful look to Alondo on his way out, but exactly what it means is not clear to you. Alondo's posture relaxes as he gets up and quietly closes the door.`
			`	"Now," says Alondo, setting aside his pad. "We have some other business. I have a lead on this symbol you wanted investigating. I still wish you'd tell me why you're looking for it, but for now, I'll accept that it's important." He fishes around in a small satchel bag that usually carries his pad and pulls out an actual piece of physical paper. The text on it reads, 'Adjunct Research Library, Navy Intelligence Observatory, Moscow. Room number: 3017A19'.`
			`	"Fortunately, I found someone for you to speak to and a cover for being there in the first place. Xilin needs a trusted aide to stay on top of things here, especially as Mountaintop progresses. So far he's found the staff provided there to be... lacking. I get the sense from him that he's expecting things to get more complicated, though he hasn't said in so many words. So, you get to go to Earth to pick up his assistant, and while you're there, you can speak to a certain Ms. Giti Gilani. She's an expert in the history of space flight and related archaic topics. Meanwhile the aide you'll pick up is a young man called Batu Cegeen. You'll have to land at the Ulaanbaatar spaceport for him, and travel locally for your business with Ms. Gilani."`

					goto finish
				`	"Do I need to speak to Xilin myself?"`
			`	Alondo shakes his head. "No, I have already told him about the plan to have you drop off some relays, and explained that it's just a minor detour to ask you to go on a bit further. It saves them having to try and arrange suitably secure transport all the way from Earth to <origin> and then back to <planet>. This way the worst he'll have to deal with is the one trip from here back to wormhole later, which is easy enough."`

		conversation
			`You land at Ulaanbaatar's spaceport and receive a message that Batu has to finalize some arrangements and will arrive in the evening. That leaves plenty of time for you to see to your other business about the symbol.`
			`	At an information desk, you inquire about the route to Moscow and are given two options. You can take a very expensive private taxi service, which you could bill to Alondo, or you can take the long route and see the sights. Either way, you'll have plenty of time before Batu arrives.`
			`	The attendant at the information desk asks you, "Would you like to contact the direct taxi service, or take the slow route and see the sights?"`
			choice

					goto "take the direct route"
				`	"The slow route sounds more scenic. I'll try that."`
			`	Moscow is thousands of kilometers away, so you travel most of the route on shuttlecraft. It seems some new pilots took an option you never considered: planet-side travel in an exclusive contract with local transit authorities who pay half the mortgage. Certainly a safe career, but it would be too dull to be restrained to just one planet.`
			`	You fly past mountain ranges and lakes, and over bare tundras and steppes. The gray cities of Earth stand out when you pass them; packed in their ancient locations and their new ones. Even from far above, the cities' vast megabuildings are an imposing sight. There's still some farmland on this route, even now that farming has largely moved off-world, but not enough for the twenty billion people living on Earth.`
			`	After three shuttle trips, you land in the city of Nizhny and board a two-story train that hovers in a tunnel of superconducting magnets. Such a complex system would be unprofitable anywhere else in human space, but the population is so high here that these village-sized trains run non-stop at full capacity. You must look lost as you disembark in the vast station in Moscow, and a passerby asks if you need directions.`
			choice
				`	"How do I get to the surface?"`
				`	"I'm looking for this address."`
			`	You follow his directions and, while strolling through Moscow to your destination, pass many historic sites. An unmistakable sight catches your eye: the Museum of Cosmonautics, one of the largest museums of spaceflight on Earth. It is most famous for having the first hyperspace-capable human-made ship on display, painstakingly preserved for hundreds of years. The museum extends into the three megabuildings surrounding it, containing all manner of spaceflight firsts.`
			`	At length you arrive at the building you seek and pass through its main doors into a room as big as a football field, filled with in-building trains, moving walkways, and hover-platform elevators. It's amazing how large Earth's megabuildings have become; some planets have smaller populations than the building you are standing in right now, and it is but one of hundreds you've seen on your short journey.`
			`	You find an information desk, and inquire about the meaning of 'room number: 3017A19' - the 301st floor, section 7A, room 19 - and get directions. They point you to what looks like a cross between a train and an elevator. A robotic voice asks your destination.`
			choice
				`	"Please take me to the 301st floor, section 7A, room 19."`
				`	"Room 3017A19, please."`
			`	Reaching the room in question you knock on the door which has a nameplate that reads, 'Giti Gilani' with the title 'Research Librarian' in small print underneath. You are swiftly greeted by a short, energetic looking lady. She looks you up and down and nods. "Captain <last>, you're not as tall as I thought you'd be in person. Please, please come in."`
				goto "converse with giti"
			label "take the direct route"
			`	You're ushered into a luxury taxi, complete with a built-in bar and the latest forms of entertainment. The taxi enters a ballistic trajectory into space and back down into the atmosphere, reaching your destination in under an hour. It links its aft exit port to a hover vehicle access port about half the way up the side of the building. The well-dressed driver leads you into the building and, after briefly consulting a directory, escorts you to your destination.`
			`	"Floor 301, section 7A, room 19, sir," he says. "This is the office of research librarian Giti Giliani."`
			choice
				`	"Thank you for the smooth trip."`

			label "converse with giti"
			`	Clearly someone took the liberty of informing Giti of at least the basic information about what was being searched for, and that it was you doing so. Once the door is shut and locked, though, it becomes clear she is quite excited about this search. She gestures to a seat near her work desk and briefly tidies some of the more egregiously scattered research items. "Would you like a drink? Tea, coffee, vodka? I already have some notes on the cat symbol but I need to discuss some things with you. Do you have any more images?"`

			`	"Well, you'll probably be disappointed with what I have so far," she begins, "but I'll start with what I have found and then you can show me any new pictures you have and we can see what I can do." She waits for you to indicate your understanding before she continues.`
			`	"This cat symbol was used a century ago by a clandestine organization called 'Base Principles' that worked within the Syndicate."`
			choice
				`	"Who were 'Base Principles?'"`
				`	"Wait. What were they doing in the Syndicate?"`
			`	She explains, "Base Principles were anarcho-syndicalists infiltrating the Syndicate from within, gaining clout through research findings gleaned from alien equipment, but nobody knows where they got it. The organization was eventually torn in two by regular anarchists and other unsavory characters looking to profit off the backdoor access to the Syndicate; this group kidnapped researchers from other institutes to expand their capabilities.`
			`	"These others didn't cover their tracks well enough; the trail led back to the syndicalists that started it all in the first place, and Syndicate Internal Affairs quickly put a stop to the organization with extreme prejudice. Most of the anarchist leaders were killed in battle or executed after capture, but the internal players simply... disappeared.`
			`	"Officially, the Syndicate maintains that they wiped Base Principles out to the last individual, but evidence never proved it had been conclusively terminated."`
			choice
				`	"That's it?"`
					goto rude
				`	"Was there anything else?"`
			`	"Yes. That was over a century ago, but only a few decades back the same symbol came up again in conjunction with a smuggling ring that was kidnapping gifted children. It seems that a minor error resulted in a crate being misplaced by the smugglers, complete with a child inside and the symbol surreptitiously stamped on the corner plate. The ship the crate was meant to be on self-destructed when it was caught, and any potential affiliates went to ground. A handful of ships and individuals were identified retrospectively to have been involved, but none of them were ever seen again. The kidnappings stopped."`
				goto newpictures

			`	She frowns at you. "No. Somewhat more recently, only a few decades back in fact, the same symbol came up again in conjunction with a smuggling ring that was kidnapping gifted children. It seems that a minor error resulted in a crate being misplaced by the smugglers, complete with a child inside and the symbol surreptitiously stamped on the corner plate. The ship the crate was meant to be on self-destructed when it was caught, and any potential affiliates went to ground. A handful of ships and individuals were identified retrospectively to have been involved, but none of them were ever seen again. The kidnappings stopped."`
			label newpictures
			`	She waves a hand dismissively at her screen. "Of course, I only received the one image to refer to, and the older records are not necessarily very good quality or captured with future research librarians in mind. So, please, show me what else you have."`
			choice
				`	"I have some pictures to show you."`
				`	"Can you glean more from this?"`
			`	You pull out your datapad and hand it to her with the folder of relevant pictures, some carefully redacted of Hai paraphernalia, for her to look at. As she begins flicking through them she makes some comments.`
			`	"You know, there's quite a lot more of these than I expected. All quite recent too, judging by the file quality and that crate design. They are exactly the same as the original. Someone clearly has made a deliberate decision to reuse the exact symbol, with no re-imagining or stylistic alterations whatsoever. If you ask me, that sounds like a group that has set itself to having the same goals, which means the Syndicate would probably be very interested in this. Though I suppose you'd have the connections there if... Oh!" She pauses. "Now this is interesting."`
			`	She turns the datapad to you and shows you what looks like an amulet or maybe a jewelry charm. The scale in the image isn't very clear. "Do you see this patterning around the outside of the symbol on this? I'm quite sure nearly everyone in the galaxy would simply pass that off as decorative, but it's not." She pauses for a moment, perhaps expecting a response.`
			choice
				`	(Politely wait for her to finish.)`
					goto disappointed
				`	"I have a hunch you're going to tell me it's a form of writing."`
			`	She looks impressed and says, "Very good! I underestimated you, Captain <last>.`
				goto archaic
			label disappointed
			`	After a couple seconds, Giti looks slightly disappointed but makes no comment on the matter.`
			label archaic
			`	"This is an archaic written shorthand notation used for ship's logs, back when they were considering data storage requirements for the thousands of people on board the slow ships they sent to Alpha Centauri. You'd be amazed how much space just logs and diaries can take up when the journey takes as long as theirs did." She smiles at you, "As it happens I wrote my Ph.D. thesis about that notation! Now I finally need that information for something other than getting a degree!"`
			`	She frowns at it for a long moment, "There's quite a lot of notation here actually and... well, gosh, it's been twenty-eight years since I did that thesis. I can't just translate this on the fly. It'll take me some time to dig up my resources and work on it. Am I allowed to keep these pictures?"`
			choice
				`	"Absolutely, I'll send you the folder."`
				`	"Yes, and I can also give you some other data too."`
			`	"Excellent, look, leave it with me and give me your contact info. I'll see if I can work out whether there's anything meaningful there and let you know."`
			`	You thank Giti for her time and depart to make the return trip to the Ulaanbaatar spaceport. You message ahead once you're on your way and arrive to find Batu waiting for you ready to depart.`
			`	For now it's back to Hai-home, and hope that Giti turns up something useful. At this point, though, maybe this whole thing is just a red herring?`

			`	An enraged Teeneep counters. "They give them our weapons so that they can more efficiently go and enslave other people, rather than just dealing with them properly the way they should have! One hundred and seventy three reports, Sayari. That's how many times they've done this, or something like it, and those are just the ones that came up in the sweep. There's no telling how many others might be filed improperly, missing key words, or just outside of my search range.`
			`	"I thought you were a model of morality, Sayari. Now I know you're no better than they are. No better than... than..."`
			`	Sayari finishes Teeneep's thought. "No better than you? The curse of power is to sacrifice your morals for protection of people under your care. I think you know that well, Teeneep. Perhaps better than I?" Teeneep looks briefly ashamed when Sayari says that.`

For the past five years, though, nearly every deal involved exchanging Hai weaponry." She looks irate at Sayari for a second.`

Teeneep needs to at least attempt to follow that process, and if she does not go through with normal resolution channels, she will be censured from public life. She must confront the Elders directly."`
			`	Teeneep makes the effort to give a final, defiant snarl of disgust. "She's right," she grates out. "I hate it, but she's right. Especially because several of those reports indicate that the Navy knew of Hai on some ships and stood by while they were taken away. Which makes it your business, too."`

Let me put a priority audience request into the system, and you can probably see them this afternoon. In the meantime, why don't I order some food here? You can use my spare desk over there to prepare what you need to say."`
			`	Teeneep takes a deep breath and accepts the plan with sudden and surprising grace. She gathers her pads, then sets up where indicated. "Alright, just get me some comfort food while I work on this."`
			`	Sayari asks you, "Her favorite foods are acorn curry and nutmeg pie. Which should we order?"`

				`	"Acorn curry sounds... good?"`
					goto curry

				`	"What does that mean?"`
				`	"Thank you, Sayari."`

			`	"Enough," says an Elder, raising his hand. "We know about your views, the 'five thousand missing Hai,' and your organization's media connections. You're already risking larger issues with your current actions. We are here to speak to your witness. Captain <last>," he says, turning to you, "tell us your views on these matters."`

We fund the development and protection of their planets, in return for them ensuring the wrong people don't find us."`
			`	Another Elder adds, "Most of the deals are much smaller, though: when a pirate gang causes mischief, we pay them to stop. Hostages, theft, raids, and the like. Usually, the same gang never bothers us again." Teeneep perks up at the word "hostages," but doesn't speak.`

			`	An Elder concludes the meeting. "The Elder Council asked us to take charge of the pirate situation, and we now have a plan of action on the pirate deals. However, I've heard enough of this 'kidnapping' conspiracy theory. Our meeting is adjourned." Teeneep's fury is palpable, but she remains silent as the three exit.`

				`	"That could have gone better."`
				`	"It sounds like we've made some progress!"`
			`	As you walk back to the diplomatic quarter, Sayari begins. "They didn't do anything, but at least they agreed to solve the problems when they become disasters."`
			`	Teeneep objects, "We can't wait for a disaster before solving this!"`
			`	Sayari agrees. "You're right, of course, in this matter. The Elders have ever struggled with change. They're not wise for this, but they were not elected to be so. They were elected to continue the long march of incremental development. Besides, you know far better than most exactly what challenges they've contended with these past couple of decades. More of them have died or retired than been unelected."`

				`	"What can we do to solve this, Sayari?"`
				`	"Teeneep, I think we need quick action. You mentioned something back in the cave."`
			`	The three of you head back to the diplomatic quarter and where Xilin and Batu lead you to a conference room. They consult Sayari, and occasionally Teeneep, in a long discussion about the Navy knowing of the pirate troubles and willfully not intervening. Xilin sympathizes and suggests the Hai ask the Navy to rescue those captured.`
			`	Batu cuts in. "I'm sorry, deputy minister, I have not had time to fully brief you. The Navy already considered this and said 'not under any circumstances' will they 'clean up the Hai's mess'." In the slightly stunned pause following his words he draws breath and adds somewhat less intensely, "It's, uh, possible that five thousand missing civilians was not one of the things they considered when they said that."`
			`	Xilin frowns. "We should definitely present that case. They'll have to do another whole round of private briefings, and then no doubt a large debate. Even if we started today, Parliament won't be able to act for months. I'll kick things off, but you'll have to be patient."`
			`	When Teeneep makes a noise as if to speak, Sayari silences her with a gentle touch and thanks Xilin in the formal capacity. He briefly thanks you for delivering Batu safely and then the two excuse themselves to see if they can get a hold of someone before their day ended.`
			choice
				`	"Should we wait for Parliament to respond?"`
				`	"Do you have any other ideas?"`
					goto "other ideas"
			`	Teeneep sighs in exasperation. "We can't wait for your parliament to spend months deliberating. Sayari, you have a crisis of your own here, and I cannot accept a resolution without an avenue to rescue our people and put a stop to this for good. I would hope you cannot either..."`
			label "other ideas"
			`	Teeneep says with certainty, "I must go to the Unfettered. If they can be swayed, then the Elders may be pressured into acting."`
			`	"Captain <last>," she says, giving you a calculating look. "I would very much appreciate it if you'd be so kind as to take me."`
# TODO: These options should be revisited at some point based on how much you've had to do with the Unfettered, despite being only flavor.
			choice
				`	"Aren't those Hai pirates? No, that sounds unwise."`
				`	"Of course, Teeneep. Let's go."`
			`	"Teeneep, no! You cannot just commandeer the Captain to act as your chauffeur wherever you want to go," says Sayari. "<last> has an important role here in this crisis."`
			`	"And what would you have them do next then?" When Sayari seems at a loss to respond, Teeneep continues. "Exactly. Your crisis is mostly resolved behind closed doors, but this crisis requires transportation. The thing you seem to be missing is that they're the same crisis, Sayari. They can't be resolved separately."`
			`	Sayari slumps back in her chair with a huff, for a moment looking as old as she says she is. Teeneep waits patiently while her friend spends a good thirty seconds seriously thinking about something. "She is right, <last>," says Sayari eventually. "This is worth trying. Please take her to the Unfettered if that is what she wishes; their government is on <destination>, but please, be careful."`
			`	As you both get up to leave Teeneep walks over and places a hand gently on the old diplomat's shoulder. "They call themselves the True Hai, maybe it's time they demonstrated it."`

			`Teeneep makes a request on your approach and then goes to prepare. You are subsequently directed to a restricted landing zone near their government complex. When she reappears Teeneep has prepared to meet the Unfettered in a somewhat surprising manner; she's wearing what looks like a fencing outfit. There are two swords on her back and several balanced knives on her belt. She's wearing a headband with a medallion on it that looks like an athletic medal.`
			`	She pays you for the trip and explains, "These blades are not ceremonial. Bring your gun with you, but hand it to them when we reach the chambers, or the Unfettered may think you're an assassin. Trust me, we'll be fine.`
			`	"Let's go," she says.`

				`	"What's your plan?"`
				`	(Follow her.)`
					goto follow
			`	"To Unfettered Hai leadership, this meeting is all a political ploy. They know it's in their best interest to help us. It will raise public opinion towards them among the "Fettered" and likely lure more recruits to their side. But before they agree, I have to prove myself in front of their troops. If I don't, the public's perception will be that the Unfettered leaders helped a weak coward. Fortunately, dangerous sports have a tendency to open doors for you in Hai society. They're an essential hobby for anyone who hopes to have influence, and I have kept up with mine reasonably well. It's been a couple decades since I won anything, but I was regional champion in fencing a number of times when I was really into it."`
			label follow
			`	Teeneep goes to disembark, pauses, then turns back to you. "Actually, before we leave the ship, there was something I wanted to make sure I explained before we meet the Unfettered leadership: I'm carrying real weapons for a reason. This meeting will probably seem violent, and that will probably make you think the Unfettered are a barbaric people. They're not; they 'play up' their violent nature. It's a hard concept to explain - we have Hai words for this that don't translate well into your language. That's the simplest way I can think to explain it without spending twenty minutes here, so it'll have to suffice."`
			`	She glances around. "Besides, we're already close to running late. Let's get going."`
			`	You enter the complex and she speaks as you pass through a hallway filled with battle trophies. "I have requested this conversation happen in your language. This is not only politeness for your benefit, but it is also to mine. To shy from a challenge is not befitting a True Hai, and for this matter I think your tongue may be more eloquent. I should have them at a disadvantage in using it, as well." A moment later you reach a guarded door; you hand your gun to an Unfettered guard and hope Teeneep understands the Unfettered Hai as much as she claims to. Beyond, you enter a large room filled with uniformed Hai. You notice many of them have swords similar to Teeneep's, though they look more ceremonial than functional.`
			`	As Teeneep walks in, an Unfettered moves to block her path. From the extensive decorations on his uniform, it appears he's a high-ranking officer. "You're not welcome here, False Hai." He starts to push her away. In one motion, Teeneep spins around, unsheathes a sword, and swipes it across his arm, drawing blood. The Hai grunts, surprised, and steps aside to let Teeneep pass. She walks toward the gigantic leader of the Unfettered, whose face betrays his surprise and admiration.`

			`	As you enter the room, a pair of Unfettered grab you. Teeneep draws a throwing knife, saying with intensity, "Let Captain <last> go. Now." The Unfettered let go immediately, and she nods for you to stay where you are, sheathing the knife.`
			label watch
			`	The leader's voice booms from where he sits at the other end of the room. "Come, False Hai. You have entered here to make a case, have at it."`
			`	Teeneep explains to the leader, "Five thousand Hai have been enslaved by human pirates, or vaporized when the human authorities have shot down their captors with no regard for the innocents on board. The Elders do not act. Will not act. They know, and do nothing. I have learned that they have known of some pirates who they felt were too much of a headache for decades, and that rather than hunt them down, they have paid them with technology. Our weapons and technology. Paid them off to simply leave us alone, and not even to return any Hai they may have captured.`
			`	"You were once the protectors of all Hai. I would honor that not out of political opportunism, but because our people need heroes and protectors that the Elders are not. So I stand here to ask you to be so again. Free our people from slavery and kill their human slavers."`
			`	The Unfettered leader responds, "Your people have outlawed and abandoned us. You give us insulting food donations with propaganda on them. You block our ships from returning to Hai-home. Why should we help you, a race of slothful cowards? Your people are willingly blind and lost, an insult to all Hai."`
			`	Teeneep suddenly takes three strides forward, closing the distance between her and the Unfettered leader in less than a second. You had forgotten how quick Hai are; few humans could do what she just did. "I challenge you for rule of the Unfettered military!"`
			`	"You haven't the authority to do that," he responds, laughing.`
			`	"Besides..." you see one of the other Unfettered to the right of the leader begin to step out. "You would ha..." Teeneep cuts the leader off as she draws a throwing knife and launches it. It zips through the air, and spears the shoulder of the Unfettered who began to move, embedding itself in the wall behind and pinning them in place.`
			`	"I would have to do what, defeat your right hand first?" She takes a step back and smirks at him. "Now, will you face a woman half your size?" From her expression, you're unsure if she genuinely has that much faith in her abilities, or if this is a bluff.`
			`	The Unfettered leader pauses, then smiles. "There is no need. Even on our planets, I've rarely met a Hai half as brave as you. You have the courage to turn an act into action. You are a True Hai, and we protect our own. You have vouched for the value of the lives of these Hai, so I say now we are willing to send our fleets to their aid. I would come myself."`
			`	She re-sheaths her swords and calls you over. "I have brought with me one of the greatest war heroes of the humans."`
			choice
				`	(Walk to her.)`
			`	"Captain <first> <last> led great fleets during a civil war of the humans. We will have the honor of fighting alongside this warrior of the humans."`
			`	He looks at you appraisingly. "That is well, but there is a matter yet to be addressed. We cannot just 'waltz' through Hai and human space without being blasted. How will you convince your Elders to allow us passage?"`
			`	"They will not allow it," says Teeneep. "We must force them."`
			`	A round of muttering breaks out around the room.`
			`	"The threat of true war, then..." In the ensuing silence you swear you could have heard a pin drop.`
			`	Teeneep bows her head. "I know it is distasteful to consider this sort of show."`
			`	The Unfettered leader considers her for a long moment before raising his head and slowly assessing the room, making eye contact with each of the others standing by.`
			`	All bravado and bluster seems to be gone from him now as he finally speaks. "Five thousand Hai, you say?"`
			`	"At least," she says, lifting her head to lock eyes with him.`
			`	With the weight of a proclamation he responds, "Then it shall be so."`
			`	There is a moment where it seems as if something respectful is being observed and then, like a switch being flicked, the energy returns and the leader smiles at you as those around start jostling and making quiet remarks to each other.`
			`	The Unfettered leader seems to sense your confusion. "Neither True Hai nor Fettered truly desire to shed the blood of the other. Our disagreement is a protest, a lesson to be learned that we are learning but slowly. Perhaps it is time though that we demonstrate the seriousness of our resolve, especially if the Elders have become so mired as for it to have come to this."`
			`	He grins. "I look forward to seeing you fight, human. Now both of you, go. Do what you must."`
			`	Teeneep turns and leads you out, making sure they return your weapon as you leave. "Now we must return to <planet> and address the Elders again. Hopefully they will now see reason."`

			`	"Ah, well those are difficult to explain, since the options worth using will depend on exactly what happens in the meeting. One thing Sayari was very right to remind me of before is that there are normal channels and processes to follow, and those must be followed. We're an old people, Captain <last>, and not always a very patient people. We've forged a system of government with systems and processes to allow almost any internal situation to be handled without resorting to base hysteria, and to actively punish and isolate those who try and subvert those processes. It is a difficult pill to swallow sometimes, but it works, and it has ensured stability since before humans learned to bash rocks together."`

We have a similar thing with our words for political systems and navigator. It's a title he has earned."`
			`	She spreads her arms, 'palms' up, in a human gesture indicating a loss for words. "Our system of government has systems and processes to allow almost any internal situation to be handled without resorting to base hysteria, and to actively punish and isolate those who try and subvert those processes. It is a difficult pill to swallow sometimes, but it works, and it has ensured stability since before humans learned to bash rocks together. Aimet is the master navigator of those systems.

			label return
			`	Teeneep's console beeps a moment prior to Sayari's slightly breathless return. A message, entirely in your language, is displayed on the screen; it announces an emergency meeting of the full Elder Council in under an hour.`
			`	Sayari steps across to Teeneep and glances at the message. "I needn't have left this room. We must prepare quickly, we're going to have an escort..."`
			`	Teeneep's expression darkens, but she quickly ensures she has what she needs before a group of Council security staff arrive to take you to the chambers. This is not the first time you've seen the room, but it is the first time you've seen it full. There is a small desk and seat at the front of the central circle, opposite the entry point, which was not occupied when you entered here for dealing with Scar's Legion but now hosts a very serious Hai bearing unusual marks of office. Sayari sees your line of vision and nudges you, conveying in a whisper, "That's the moderator. They're only required when more than two thirds of the council is in attendance, and when there's a debate or petition to address."`
			`	She glances around the room and raises an eyebrow. "This is a closed session, which is quite unusual for a full Council Assembly. This does not bode well."`
			`	As the security staff take their place, the moderator walks over to address you while the Elders are still filtering in and muttering to each other. "Now, before we begin, I would like to confirm. I understand you are able to act as a witness, and confirm that the threat carried from the Unfettered was indeed real. Is this correct?"`
			choice
				`	"That is correct."`
					goto correct
				`	"I can also testify to the human position on the matter."`
			`	The moderator pulls a strange face and says, "Right, well, I doubt that will be necessary.`
			label correct
			`	"Thank you, Captain. Since you have become involved as a witness, protocol dictates that the session will be held in your language, though for the sake of order normal council directions will still be in Hai. We will begin in a moment."`
			`	After everyone is set in place, the moderator abruptly starts. "Teeneep has provided a confession about her visit to the Unfettered, incitement to war, involvement of outside government in internal Hai matters, and other concerns. She has justified this by an argument of necessity, that it is essential for action to be taken to produce both a peaceful outcome for the ongoing crisis with humanity and to heal a hole in the heart of our society."`
			`	When the moderator refers to 'healing the hole', it is spoken with an emphasis that implies heavy quotation, and you can hear the muttering of translations and scoffs rippling out among the Elders in the room.`
			`	Sayari hisses with distaste and quietly says, "The framing of this is terrible, someone has already decided what outcome they'd like to get and has got in on this process early."`
			`	The moderator calls something out in Hai which ends with 'Teeneep' and Sayari translates, "The Council hears Teeneep."`
			`	Not visibly disheartened by the situation, Teeneep steps into the middle and begins. She makes her case thoroughly and passionately, but with a clearly well-practiced presentation structure, ensuring that the full background for the situation is laid out for those present. Some Elders make snide comments at various points, but the moderator shuts them down and those most skeptical settle for being merely disengaged. When she presents the Unfettered's position as an offer of assistance there is a smattering of largely disbelieving sounds, though when she speaks of their willingness to force the matter the tone of the conversation gets remarkably more tense. "If you don't act, they will. Whether that's with you, or through you," she finishes.`
			`	One of the more stubborn Elders stands up, heralded by the moderator. "The Unfettered have made serious attempts to push through at Wah Ki before, to no avail. More recently, they've been more trouble again, and again we have organized more than enough security to keep their disruption contained, even with the current human crisis. This threat is ridiculous, and the Unfettered would not dare, not while they are so dependent on our food and medical supplies these past years. They would most certainly sacrifice many thousands of lives in the pursuit of misguided justice for a mere handful."`
			`	"You are blind. Blind and old and foolish," snaps Teeneep, but another Elder has leaped to their feet and the moderator cuts her off with a rebuke that you don't need translated to know what it means.`
			`	After being properly heralded, the new Elder addresses you. "I understand Teeneep has enlisted you as her gopher. You have my sympathy. I have no doubt that your continued involvement means that you accept her conspiracy theories that many of the pirate activities, specifically relating to kidnapping and people smuggling, are a coordinated effort. So I will not waste time retreading your position on points she has just laid out. I must ask you of this recent interaction, though. Tell me, how would you characterize Teeneep's meeting with the Unfettered Choot'k: constructive, aggressive, or something else?"`

			`	A roomful of laughter engulfs your words, but many Elders appear offended by their peers' mockery. The Elder who questioned you explains, "The Elders and the Unfettered have different views of what constitutes a 'constructive discussion.' You lack the biases of a Hai. If you say it was constructive, I believe you." The tone of the room changes after that, as the laughter ends. Most Elders appear to agree with your assessment, and many who laughed look ashamed.`
			label next
			`	Sayari gives you a meaningful look and whispers, "A lot of them paid attention to that..."`
			`	The next Elder to their feet is an older lady Hai, and her expression alone is enough to cause a flicker of concern to disrupt Teeneep's careful mask of calm. She gestures around the room, pointing with a digit and squinting at several others in the room. "You are, all of you, cowards. This is the highest chamber of the Hai, elected to protect and serve, and to ensure the enduring stability of the great edifice which is now a hundred millennia of stability. This one here has sought to upend that authority and topple that edifice in favor of nothing more than a statistical blip. Five thousand Hai in two hundred years is barely a concern. That many managed to get themselves killed swimming with Gelo Appanoh in the last decade alone! Freedom through peace, peace through order, order through security, and security through secrecy. This is the mandate of this chamber, and no matter how virtuous the challenger may be, this threat cannot be allowed to stand!"`
			`	There is a growing rumble of assent as the crescendo of her impassioned statement crests to its conclusion. She levels a clawed finger directly at Teeneep and the room is filled with the angry cries of both those emboldened by her diatribe and those distressed by her implication. The moderator makes several attempts to restore order as over a dozen Elders jump to their feet, but the cacophony is not so easily restrained. At your side, Sayari's expression is ashen, but Teeneep seems to be seeking out a particular face somewhere in the room with a fierce intensity.`
			`	There is a shift in the sound of the room and your attention is drawn to one Hai in particular, a particularly elderly man who struggles to his feet in a series of pained stages. The effect on the assembly is profound, though. A ripple of silence flows outward from his position, and Elders all around promptly drop back into their seats as it reaches them, leaving a scant handful who were too slow to react to have their final words trail off awkwardly. Only the last speaker remains on her feet, the moderator weakly announcing in Hai what you know to be, "The council hears Aimet."`
			`	"Security through secrecy..." He coughs. "You throw that in there as if it were always so Gemnali but, unlike you, I was there when it was added to the mandate of this chamber."`
			`	He peers around the room, and you realize he is blind, or nearly so. "Freedom may be achieved through peace, but peace must not be maintained at the cost of freedom. Order may not be pursued at the cost of peace, nor security at the cost of order. Always this mandate must be considered in both directions. To censure this woman, to resist action on this matter... You would have us pursue secrecy at the cost of security."`
			`	He coughs again, and it echoes in the silence of nearly a hundred Hai holding their breath. When he continues, his voice grows stronger and sharper. "My eyes may not see as well as they used to, but there are many in this chamber who are yet too blind to see. The edifice of our stability is not threatened by this woman who would have us restore security to our lost brethren. It is you who would use her virtue to topple it yourself."`
			`	The silence stretches with all eyes on Gemnali. She clenches her fists, shaking with barely suppressed emotion, before collapsing back into her seat as if physically struck.`
			`	Whatever spell had held the room is immediately broken and a susurrus of murmuring rises to fill its space. Within the noise a certain phrase starts to be repeated multiple times, drawing an expression of shock from Sayari.`
			choice
				`	"What are they saying?"`
				`	"What just happened?"`
			`	She glances at you briefly. "They are saying: Veeheylur and Misanaya fight over Eyrisen." Her tone carries with it a sense of awe, and despite the growing volume in the room she leans in close to you and continues in scarcely more than a whisper, "The Mythos has been invoked."`
			`	As Aimet painfully resumes his seat, one Elder who has thus far been maintaining a fairly neutral demeanor in this seems to regain a certain sense of himself and stands up, quickly heralded by the moderator, who struggles to compose himself suitably. "I think the Council has heard enough. The petitioner is entitled to a closing statement, unless there is objection?"`
			`	None of those assembled who might object seem to have recovered their composure enough to stand up quickly, and the moderator, perhaps sensing a politic moment to intervene, quickly announces the closing of the interrogation and calls the Council to hear Teeneep again.`
			`	Teeneep quickly plasters back on her mask of calm as best she is able to and says, "Thank you all for your ears. You are those we trust to decide, but know this: If you will not listen to this here, then apparently I must now be the one to present a pathway to avoid war. The Unfettered are committed, no matter what path I choose now. If you do not take action, I will make the history of inaction I have discovered public knowledge. Every Hai from Greenwater to Snowfeather will know by the end of the day."`
			`	One Elder cries out, "You wouldn't dare!" To which Teeneep responds, "It is already scheduled to happen unless I actively stop it!"`
			`	Before any further exchange can occur, though, the moderator bellows for security to escort you all from the session and shouts down the offending Elder for impropriety. The two remain engaged in a lively shouting match as you depart, the echoes following you until the chamber doors are shut.`
			`	Teeneep moves to pull out a datapad, but both the security officers and Sayari step in to stay her hand. "The chamber will have to vote on the proposition to act," says Sayari, looking at Teeneep pointedly. "You know that external contact is forbidden during the deliberation grace window."`
			choice
				`	"The deliberation grace window?"`
				`	"So what, do we just wait?"`
					goto wait
			`	Teeneep sighs and points an exasperated expression your way. "Yes, after certain types of chamber hearings there is an enforced period where the petitioner must remain isolated to the chamber's waiting area, including digitally. I forgot for a moment."`
			label wait
			`	Sayari smiles at you. "Don't worry though, it's only for about twenty-three of your minutes." She eyes the security officer warily. "After a session such as that though, the traditional wisdom is to wait in relative silence."`
			`	"If it wasn't a closed session we wouldn't be doing this," harrumphs Teeneep. "I hadn't realized it would be so didn't plan for it."`
			
			`	After only about seventeen minutes the moderator slips out and exchanges some words with Teeneep and Sayari before re-entering the chamber. "We've been released," says Sayari. "They've voted to take no immediate action, either for or against Teeneep."`
			`	Teeneep just shakes her head, pulls out a datapad, and quickly taps a few times. "Well, that was going to happen in an hour. No point waiting, though. Let's get dinner."`
			choice
				`	(Get dinner.)`
					goto dinner
				`	(Decline and maybe eat with the diplomats.)`
			`	There are some perfectly adequate meal places in the cafeteria area. There you manage to join Alondo and Remington, who have a surprisingly civilized conversation the entire time. Albeit mostly about work.`
			`	You're still finishing up a little shortly after they leave, at which point a harried-looking Sayari appears and practically sprints across the room to you.`
				goto alarm

			`	You join Teeneep and Sayari at a fusion restaurant about a block down the road from the 'Elders' Chambers' - which turns out to be the official name of the whole government complex.`
			`	Having finished your main meal, and while waiting for some dessert that Teeneep has ordered, Sayari pulls out her datapad. "You know, while we're waiting. It's probably a good idea to check the damage. I don't know if your plan is actually going to have the desired effect, you know. Especially after that scene in there; no doubt the long tooths will get riled up."`
			choice
				`	"What was that in there about the Mythos?"`
				`	"What will happen if they get riled up?"`
					goto riled
			`	Teeneep rolls her eyes, putting her drink down with a sharp clink. "It's superstition. Humans have their religions, the Hai have the Mythos. It's a collection of stories about Hai who lived incredibly long lives and were involved in or responsible for incredibly influential events in our history, or more accurately pre-history for the vast majority of them. If you believe the stories literally, these Hai transcended mortal limitations and achieved immortality; our word for them translates imprecisely to either 'immortals' or 'imperishables'. When someone embodies a character from it well enough, there's a set of people who will believe it's actually that person come back to steer things.`
			`	"Someone in there has linked that scene to a story, in which I am implicated as Eyrisen."`
			label riled
			`	She scoffs and waves a paw dismissively. "The contingencies shouldn't be affected. Superstition is mostly dead, it's really only the Elders that subscribe to it." She pauses and looks at Sayari. "The plan will work just fine."`
			`	Sayari grumbles, "There's plenty of older Hai, those 'long tooths', that align with particular political factions. They also tend to subscribe, at least selectively, to the superstitions. Despite what Teeneep says, I would not count out the potential impact that scene in there could have on the situation."`
			`	She rounds on Teeneep. "I mean, seriously, Tee, what will you do if the plan doesn't play out fine? Will the Hai actually have to shed our brethren's blood with lethal intent?"`
			`	Teeneep just sips her drink and shakes her head. "Oh, Sayari, you really are getting too long in the tooth yourself for domestic politics these days."`
			`	A moment later Sayari squeaks and looks up in horror. "You triggered an election?! This wasn't just making it public, you had the petition for redress ready to go all along!"`
			`	She scrolls down on her pad several times and begins to mutter, "Oh dear, oh no." She lapses into Hai for a moment before returning. "It hit the trending issues board, and triggered the safety policy alert response. People got direct notifications that this was an issue. There are over two billion supporting votes for an injunctive action and it's only been two hours... this is what you hoped would happen, isn't it?"`
			`Teeneep places a gentle hand on Sayari's arm. "Better this than war."`
			label alarm
			`	Sayari's eyes are alive with thinly-veiled panic as she slams her hand down on the table. "Captain <last>, you must leave immediately. Get on your ship and fly to <planet> right now! The winds of change are afoot and we will have an election. They'll hit the threshold in maybe only twenty minutes, and it'll take maybe thirty more for the bureaucracy to act on it. The instant the election is announced formally, all non-essential ships will be grounded, all communication in or out of Hai space will be cut off, and the border will be sealed to everyone - not in the polite way either. If even one ship tries to cross the border to investigate... there's no telling what will happen."`

			`The spaceport appears to be operating on a skeleton staff with an increased security presence. Plenty of ships are still coming and going, but they seem to be here strictly on business. The usual milling of tourists, haggling of merchants, and perusal of jobs all appear to have been suspended in favor of efficient boarding and disembarking of Hai with places to go and goods with places to be. The displays in the main thoroughfare have been switched over to wall-to-wall election coverage and the rest of the non-essential sections of the spaceport have been closed.`

It certainly seems like things are heated. Different charts being presented for the same areas seem to suggest that there's a great deal of controversy and some very strong opinions being thrown around.

			`	"Apologies for my brethren's behavior, Captain, but this is a very important time for the Hai. Many are under significant strain to be informed and also maintain their essential business as captains themselves. There are a number of regulations for Hai citizens to stay on top of if they are frequently moving between worlds during the period, and they haven't had the time to prepare that they usually would."`

"No one is more closely tied to the specific dynamics of trade between our worlds, and the subtleties of what makes them healthy, than our merchant captains are. I believe the human phrase is that they have their, 'fingers on the pulses', yes? This election has nothing to do with economics, and yet all the candidates have historical economic platforms that they can be expected to bring with them. These captains are being bombarded by queries from friends, families, organizations they trade with frequently, institutions they studied at or supported, local media outlets, and more.`
			`	"Ordinarily, they would spend at least a month checking on different things and solidifying their positions before an election. A snap election has robbed them of that preparation time, and so they are stressed and concerned. Many, including myself, will have to put up with the consequences of this election for at least the next two decades before any meaningful correction can occur, should the outcome be unfortunate. Long is the timeline that a Hai merchant must consider when asked who should be supported in an election."`
				goto ping

			`	He smiles. "You must not have considered the Hai lifespan, Captain. A human might not understand the situation to have nuanced opinions until they are more than twenty years of age, and by the time they are fifty the outcome of their votes are unlikely to have a large effect on the remainder of their lives. It is comparatively easy, if things are okay, for you to simply ignore your politics in favor of other things. A Hai may live for over three hundred years, if they are quite fortunate, but will in most cases still be trying to make a livelihood halfway through that. Barring accident, stupidity, or malicious action, a Hai will typically live to see the longer term effects of their voting preferences. The more wealth a Hai has, the more significant those effects are likely to be. There are few Hai more politically aware than merchant captains, and fewer still whose opinions on the effects of change are trusted more widely.`

A selection of brave but confused tourists are trying to work out how to get from one place to another, now that the line has disrupted all normal flow through this section. Someone is crying behind a greenscreen, and a great many people involved both in running the station and making the movie seem to be frantically attempting to keep up with events.

It is late in the day when you enter the diplomatic wing of the government complex. The developing gloom as Ya Hai sinks behind the buildings of the capital underscores the mood; the place appears nearly deserted.`
			`	Fortunately though, you swiftly discover Alondo and Remington who are sitting in the empty cafeteria with paired glasses of what appears to be scotch whiskey. When he sees you Alondo raises a hand and gestures for you to sit with them. "<first>! Bloody hell, come join us."`

The ones where there's some populist extremist with dangerous ideas that the establishment is just blindly assuming couldn't possibly be successful, while at the same time that same populist is whipping crowds into a violent frenzy on the streets outside."`
			`	On the screen the face of a charming-looking male Hai comes up and Alondo points with sudden vigor. "Him! I swear there was going to be torches and pitchforks right below my window one night thanks to him. He's here on Hai-home, as are his followers."`
			`	You are relieved to see that when it flicks over to the stats, the individual in question looks to be losing out on whatever his target was by a nice, comfortable, seven percentage points.`
			`	Remington nods sagely and an unreadable expression flicks between them for a moment before he looks back at you. "The Hai electoral system seems quite simple on the surface, but they seem to have a complex series of reserve steps and fail-safes for if any outcomes aren't clear enough for their thresholds. For almost all of yesterday I couldn't even find a Hai in this very building who could translate what was going on well enough to make sense of it.`
			`	"They only started locking in the last few seats a couple of hours ago. Until then we could have been prisoners and at war by now for all we knew. Peace-oriented heads seem to have prevailed though, but there's no lack of passion even in them. Near as I can tell from what has been explained and what I'm seeing; a third of the Elders have been replaced, which is the fastest change they've had since they were invaded by Korath... which I also didn't know was a thing that had happened until yesterday."`
			`	He manages to make that last line sound both bewildered and grumpy at the same time. "That Teeneep you've been running around with - and yes, don't look at me in shock, Sayari told me when we were concerned you might not get out. You've developed some friends in high places and I admire that... where was I?"`
			`	"Teeneep!" says Alondo, perhaps a little too loudly, nearly poking Remington in the face.`
			`	"Of course, that Teeneep of yours, she had her position settled yesterday. She's being..." He curls his lip and frowns while looking for the right word. "Inaugurated! She's being inaugurated in about an hour or so. It's why we're still here. She's the youngest 'elder' since before we developed fire, or some similarly ridiculous time-frame. She seems to have the most influence among the new lot, at least now that 'sir pitchforks and Pulse Rifles' down there has definitively lost. She's a firebrand, that one, but she seems principled and decent. We're waiting to hear what she has to say in her victory speech."`

			`	Remington answers your question. "That Teeneep of yours, she had her position settled yesterday. She's being..." He curls his lip and frowns while looking for the right word. "Inaugurated! She's being inaugurated in about an hour or so. It's why we're still here. She's the youngest 'elder' since before we developed fire, or some similarly ridiculous time-frame.

				`	"Just a water for me, thanks."`
					goto watch
				`	"It's time for some celebratory beer. I'll have the best ale!"`
				`	"I'll need some 'medicine' to get through this horror. Anything at least 80 proof should do."`
			`	After a few more drinks, Teeneep's speech comes on. Either it's all in Hai, or you drank more than you thought. The speech is short and punchy, but restrained; or at least her delivery of it has that feeling. With nothing else to do, and it being well into the evening, you call it a night.`

			`	As it turns out, Teeneep's speech is in Hai with no translation available. It's short and punchy, but restrained; or at least her delivery of it has that feeling. With nothing else to do, and it being well into the evening, you call it a night.`
			label morning
			`	The following morning Sayari finds you with Alondo, Remington, Xilin and Batu all having vending machine breakfasts in the cafeteria. It turns out Hai vending machines aren't half bad.`
			`	"Morning to all of you." She seems a little stiff compared to normal. "I'm glad you're all here together, it'll save me some time. Now, I have good news and bad news. I believe it's polite to ask which do you want first?"`
			`	Alondo and Remington both groan, neither having pulled up particularly well this morning. Xilin has a great deal more composure but looks like he's not had a break from stress in well over a month... which is probably accurate. "Why don't you pick, <last>?" he says.`
			choice
				`	"Good news."`
					goto goodnews
				`	"Bad news."`
			`	"Well, the bad news is that I'm afraid you're all going somewhere. You have an hour to collect your things and be ready to go. We are going to rendezvous with a fleet."`
			`	That seems to make people sit up a bit straighter and Alondo seems to unconsciously stabilize himself against Remington's shoulder. "The good news is that we're probably not going to be getting into a fight. The new Elder council has somewhat more, uh, flexibility than the previous one."`
				goto summary

			`	"Well, the good news is that we're probably not going to be getting into a fight with the Republic. Peaceful voices for change triumphed over more radical instigators. The new Elder council has somewhat more, uh, flexibility than the previous one."`
			`	Xilin actively seems to draw strength from this news, and Remington claps Alondo on the shoulder with a quiet, "told ya." Sayari continues. "The bad news is that I'm afraid you're all going somewhere. You have an hour to collect your things and be ready to go. We have a fleet to meet and there's more work ahead of us."`
			label summary
			`	The freshest of the group, Batu, seems to twig to something first. "There's going to be an ultimatum, isn't there? The fleet is a threat."`
			`	"Yes," says Sayari. "It's going to be a very broad ultimatum though, with lots of room for the Republic to decide how it's addressed; and no one is shooting at anyone without talking first. Now, all of you except <last> are traveling with Elder Teeneep. I suggest you go and prepare immediately."`
			`	As the meeting disperses, Sayari motions for you. She leads you away to have a private discussion.`
			choice
				`	"What has Teeneep done, Sayari?"`
					goto hasdone
				`	"I take it you need another ride?"`
			`	She puts her paw over her face and breathes a long sigh. "Yes, Captain <last>, I do need another ride." She smiles sadly and looks away for a moment.`
			label hasdone
			`	Her tone is very serious as she explains, "Things might be tense now, but I promise, things aren't as bad as they look. I know Teeneep, and she has the influential backing of another long-time advocate for sensible change, who was also just elected. They are remaining here to reinforce her position. Teeneep displaced that Elder who threatened her in the chambers. It's upset all the long-term power dynamics in the Council, but it's a much better Council overall now.`
			`	"Events are in motion though, we're to go to <stopovers> and then to <planet> - and you're to come with us too. I don't think it's something they view as optional, and I'm told I'm required to travel with you... as insurance."`
			`She hesitates, seeming oddly nervous for the one who theoretically has all the power in the room. "<last>, this will sound silly, but I'm a bit of a traditionalist sometimes. There's a superstition about space travel, and under the circumstances... I'm too old for this stress. Could you please do me a favor and make sure you have a Quantum Keystone on your ship? It's meant to be good luck, and well, I think we need it."`
			choice
				`	"Of course."`
					goto course
				`	"No."`
			`	Her expression is deeply wounded, but she sets her resolve. "Then this is no longer a request. It's a requirement.`
				goto end

			`	She looks relieved. "Thank you, I really appreciate it.`

			`Upon docking at <origin>, now bereft of civilians, you and Sayari are kept out of things for a little while, as some business occurs behind a Navy security barricade in the direction of where Teeneep's ship docked. Neither Terry nor Turner are allowed through either, as Navy personnel progressively establish operations and set secure areas on the station. Eventually Batu is sent out to get all of you and escort you in.`
			`	As you reach Xilin, who is also joined by other diplomats and even Danforth, Sayari is intercepted by a Hai functionary and led away. Xilin looks at you all with a grave face and begins. "So. The Hai have broadcast the threat that if the Republic does not treat with them seriously, the united Hai will move in without Republic approval to search for their people. We're at a political impasse now, as the Cabinet is blocking any progress.`
			`	"The Hai have demanded we cut through the red tape by having the heads of state meet." He turns to you briefly. "They insist on you as a mediator. I think behind-the-scenes discussions have reached the point where we can proceed, and we've gathered to prepare you for the meeting."`

			`	Xilin responds, "The Navy has blockaded the wormhole to the best of its ability, but the reality is that the Navy is already heavily committed, and barely look to be a match for the Hai fleet numbers. The Hai, on the other hand, do not yet appear to be committed heavily." He looks at Alondo briefly. "We had the unstated privilege of observing the Hai security fleet left behind on Everhope in addition to what we saw beyond the wormhole on our way in."`
			`	Danforth interjects, "In short, we doubt we can stop them while we're stretched out here... and if the reality is that they're only going to go after pirate worlds... well, we'd be under orders to disengage. The political crisis would be more tolerable than the probable military defeat."`

True or not. In all likelihood the Republic would fracture and the Free Worlds would probably be on the receiving end of a migration crisis.

			`	Xilin proceeds to list off a number of names, but to everyone's irritation and surprise, Turner cuts in. "Remington, I know you're the PR guy, and you keep your nose out of sales, so I apologize if it's presumptuous for me to assume you haven't considered this, but most of those names are people who listen to the Syndicate. I should know, I've had to negotiate with them as a bloc often enough for government contracts. Has anyone on your side reported back to the Syndicate Board and suggested that, perhaps, if we can influence them to support a solution that we propose; even if we don't have that solution defined yet; the Hai could be a very large and very profitable market for Syndicate goods?"`
			`	There is a long, expectant pause as Remington looks to Terry and they engage in some kind of silent exchange before he replies. "You know, I don't think we'd connected those two specific dots just yet." He looks at Terry. "We need to make some calls."`
				goto questions
			label begin
			`	A few hours later, they manage to set up a clear channel dedicated to the meeting in a room with large wall-mounted displays. Xilin and Alondo are standing near you, slightly off camera. Alondo explains, "We've arranged a high-reliability feed directly to the President of the Republic and the Chancellor of the Free Worlds. You'll see them here soon, along with Teeneep and Sayari from another room in the station."`
			`	Soon after, the leaders all appear. You knew the moment was coming but you're still a little surprised to see the President and Chancellor in remarkable clarity and surprisingly low latency. The windows behind the Chancellor suggest they were awoken in the middle of the night for this, but you wouldn't guess it from looking at them.`
			`	Xilin whispers to you, "Teeneep wants you to mediate, so you need to begin the proceedings. Ask her to present the problem."`
			choice
				`	"Would the Hai representative please present us the problem we must solve together?"`
					goto formality
				`	"Teeneep, please explain the problem to the human leaders. I'm sure we can come to a compromise that will suit everyone."`
			`	Teeneep responds, "Thank you for mediating these proceedings, Captain <last>."`
			label formality
			`	Teeneep explains, "I speak as the voice of the Hai and with the full authority of the Elder Council. Thousands of our people have been kidnapped over the past few decades, and they still largely reside under the servitude of various pirate factions that the Republic allows to continue. Even worse, your authorities have allowed numerous Hai to be slipped past on slaver ships, without attempting rescue because of the no boarding policy your forces employ, even on disabled and potentially doomed ships. We demand the return of our people and an immediate end to the policy of letting slaves die or escape without attempting boarding and rescue."`
			`	The President is the first to respond. "The problem of piracy in human space is a difficult one and cannot be solved overnight. The pirates are well-entrenched in their planets, and fighting them is a long and brutal struggle. With our navies distracted fighting one another, our recent war has left them stronger than ever."`
			`	The Chancellor states, "However, the Free Worlds has made great strides reducing piracy by befriending the peoples of the anarchist worlds. We are discussing similar approaches with the Republic. Perhaps in another few years, piracy will be entirely eliminated."`
			`	Xilin whispers to you again, "The problem is of immediate concern, and the Hai will not view this as an acceptable proposal. They need to respond."`
			choice
				`	"Is this an acceptable proposal, Teeneep?"`
				`	"With respect, Chancellor, this is a problem of immediate concern. I'm sure the Hai representative would like to respond to that before we continue."`
					goto calm
			`	Teeneep looks perturbed, and has to make an effort to hold back her anger and resentment. The other heads of state don't seem to notice; perhaps you're more sensitive to Hai facial expressions after the time you have spent with them. "Of course not," she says.`
			label calm
			`	Teeneep responds plainly, "We are a peaceful people by nature, but these pirate attacks have gone too far. We support a solution that benefits the innocent inhabitants of the pirate worlds. However, there must be immediate action, not years of delay."`
			`	Xilin whispers to you, "Ask politely for a counter-proposal."`
			choice
				`	"Are there any counter-proposals?"`
					goto happypres
				`	"Surely a group of enlightened human leaders can propose an alternative?"`
			action
				set patronizedthepresident
			`	The President presents a stony mask at being patronized, but the Chancellor smirks. You get a furry little smile from Teeneep.`
			label happypres
			`	"We have a counter-proposal," the President says. "We cannot afford to change our policy in totality, it would cost too many lives. However, we propose the following: the Free Worlds and Republic will establish a customs service on Mountaintop. Hai visiting human space will check in with us there. Our intelligence agencies will then track their movements in order to see to their safety as best we can. They'll also be given contacts on every human planet that they can go to for help. In the meantime, we will place extensive surveillance fleets at Ultima Thule to detect any unapproved Hai travel. We will do our best to disable and capture ships with kidnapped Hai, no matter the risk to Navy lives."`
			`	"The Free Worlds will also extend our protection, of course," the Chancellor adds.`
			`	Teeneep looks relieved by this suggestion.`
			`	Xilin whispers to you, "This is the solution everyone already discussed behind the scenes on the human side. You need to confirm the Hai will accept it."`
			choice
				`	"Would that be acceptable, Elder Teeneep?"`
				`	"Teeneep, will that satisfy the Hai?"`
			`	Teeneep takes a moment to respond. "That sounds like an acceptable future state... but I cannot sign any treaty yet. The Hai will not be satisfied until our kidnapped brethren are returned."`
			`	The President replies, "The Minister for Foreign Affairs has been keeping the Cabinet apprised of the major details and proposals reported back by Deputy Minister Yang. Under the circumstances we believe it would be appropriate for us to attempt a joint effort to address your concerns. We agree to making this effort against one target, and to reassessing the situation afterwards depending upon what is discovered in that process. The Republic representatives there with you now will work with you to identify that target and plan the action accordingly."`
			`	The smoothness with which this goes down gives you the sense that the main points of this were all provisionally agreed to already, with only a little wiggle room left to be settled in this conversation.`
			`	Sayari steps up and whispers something to Teeneep who then seems to think for a moment before returning to the screens. "This pathway is acceptable."`
			`	Xilin whispers to you, "The functionaries are waiting for your signal to end the call so we can implement the decision. And, of course, so the Chancellor can get some sleep."`
			choice
				`	"That ends these proceedings."`
				`	"Thank you, President, Chancellor, and Hai representative."`
			`	The President and Chancellor nod mechanically while Teeneep perks her ears and tilts her head in a motion that usually signals pride.`
			`	After the screens go off, a number of people involved in the busywork of bureaucracy start slipping out of the room, doubtlessly to get a head start on certain preparations, as Teeneep and the leaders on the screen conclude some formal thanks for continued cooperation and other matters of protocol. You are too visible to slip away though and have to wait.`
			`	When you finally emerge Terry and Turner are waiting for you. Terry addresses you. "Captain <last>. We have a little problem. The many civilians that have been living under this cover or being serviced by it have been kept in the dark, and are very nervous about the massed Navy ships. They've been so far sold a story about a 'pirate menace,' and now we need them out of here."`
			`	Turner smiles, "And I think it would be appropriate if you, as the famous war hero, were the one to escort them to safety and keep everyone's eyes away from what's happening here."`
			`	The two of them look at each other for a second before Terry says, "We also need to get out of here ourselves. With the movie cover shutting down, we both have other things we really should be doing, and so we'd like to come with you. It would be much safer on your ship than with any of the merchant ships that need escorting."`
