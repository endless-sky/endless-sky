This gives us a safe place to hide any critical people or information. Plus once we've removed enough of the microtransceivers they no longer function effectively. This place gives us plenty of space to keep samples and people far enough apart for safety without the obvious precautions that would be necessary somewhere more populated."`

We call them microtransceivers. They act together as one big transmitter and receiver, sending and receiving directional messages over great distances."`
			`	"This technology is clearly not of human or Hai origin. It has similarities to some microbots used in Hai medicine that are used to seal off ruptures causing internal bleeding, but the construction of these is significantly beyond our science, and some materials involved have properties unlike anything we've ever studied up close. Another race's hand has been involved in this technology; we're looking for one that has mastered miniaturized technology and is comfortable with its principles."`
			`	"What is most troubling is that we don't know how to detect the signals beyond about thirty meters. We can tell they send messages over much longer distances through hyperspace, but they use a method we don't understand."`

			`	"A disproportionate number are from the intelligentsia: doctors, scientists, engineers, architects. In particular, they are gifted researchers in their field, but not prominent enough for the field to be crippled by their absence. The same is happening in human space. In research institutions, people are occasionally disappearing. The patterns are exactly the same. We believe someone is collecting researchers."`

The number may be less; some of those cases may be undiscovered murders, secret changes of identity, or defections to the Unfettered. Maybe five times that number of humans."`

				goto questions

			`	"Our biggest problem is the lack of help in human space. Local police are generally overwhelmed with crime in the regions where the kidnapping victims are found. There, kidnappings are commonplace. In the areas where the victims were taken, there's virtually no evidence. Your navies and intelligence agencies haven't the time to help us; they're busy cleaning up after the war. There is a lot of unfinished business in Syndicate space they don't want to talk about."`
			`	"While the crime in Hai space is rather more manageable, the same lack of evidence makes it hard for the Elders to justify a dedicated task force when more visible priorities still dominate the news feeds. They tell me that if we can prove the kidnappings are from a coordinated effort, they'll put all the resources they can spare into stopping the crime. So far, they say, their investigators have been unable to discover anything."`

This will tell you how to detect these microtransceivers," it explains, handing you a standard data card compatible with human computers. "Take this to Tarazed Shipyards."`

			`You read Teeneep's contact information for Tarazed Shipyards, and it talks about a man named Goraz Zoltof, who works in their communications research laboratory. There's an address and detailed information about the man whose wife went missing under mysterious circumstances some time ago. After a series of shuttles and trains, you reach his house and knock on the door.`
			`	He's a little groggy, but manages to ask, "Yes?" You explain about the microtransceivers, the Quarg, and the kidnappings. You avoid mentioning that some of the people are Hai, just in case he's never heard of them. He seems to awaken immediately. "You found a lead on my wife's disappearance? Yes, I think I can help you. Let's go to my laboratory at once."`
			choice
				`	(Head to the laboratory.)`
			`	After another series of shuttles and trains, you reach what looks like a spaceport. From the extra equipment and unusual ship designs, you realize it is a research shipyard. Goraz's laboratory is an entire docking bay with a modified Blackbird. Despite its size, it is conspicuously absent any other personnel. He takes you on board and, noting your attention to your surroundings, explains that he has few assistants that are typically off-world most of the time as he walks you to the communications room.`
			`	"Here, let me take a look at what you've brought me." He takes the data card you got from the Quarg and plugs it into the communicator. After several minutes of typing and muttering incoherently to himself he pauses as a simulation plays on his screen. You're not sure exactly what you're looking at but when it finishes he lets out a long slow breath and comments to himself in a low voice. "Bastijn Biesterveld you absolute legend. He was right, it's the interference."`
			`	He turns back to you and explains. "Normally interference isn't something that's logged, but when you're in civilized space with hyperspace relays as your ship jumps it does a final handshake with the local relay station. That station sends that handshake signature to the destination station so it knows exactly who you are to be able to reconnect communications at the other end. It's a fully automatic process and it's independent of ship ID's, it's just buried in there as a check from back in the days when hyperdrives would occasionally explode and we'd need to work out who went missing. It gets logged and automatically overwritten every couple days, and someone would probably have gotten rid of it if it wasn't so deeply baked into the way the system works. If you know when a ship jumped and where it jumped to, you can use it to confirm it didn't blow up; and if there's something wrong with the communications equipment you can use the log info to identify if a specific ship is the same ship talking to you later, but neither of those are particularly useful since the same information can be acquired more easily and in much higher quality through other means."`
			`	He stops and looks sheepish for a moment. "Sorry, that was probably way more explanation than you needed. There's a small group of us comms people that have lost people or know people who have, that the authorities can't help. We're scattered all over and we've been looking at this ourselves. Together we identified some ships we thought were suspicious but we've not been able to pin down anything concrete. Bastijn was convinced there was a pattern of interference signatures from the logs; he made the analysis program but it was never definitively distinct from the noise. Now though, well what you've given me is a match!"`
			`	He casts around for a moment and then plugs in a freshly unpacked data card into his console. "Gimme a minute I can do something for you now. Just uh, sit down for ten minutes and I'll be back with you."`
			choice
				`	(Sit down.)`
				`	(Stand around idly.)`
			`	After some time, in which he looks like he's installing a series of programs onto it, he returns your original data card and the second one, now loaded up with whatever he was putting on it. "Load this new card into one of your communicator's extra data storage slots, preferably the first one. This new card will run maintenance level processes with the communicator to download the logs from the local station when you enter a system and match the log signatures for ships that are in-system and code up extra info for their ID's. Functionally, they'll show up as 'Smuggler' on your display. You'll have to hunt for them though, cause you'll have to be in the same system as them for any of this to work.`
			`	"Also uh, maybe keep this quiet. This is..." He clears his throat conspicuously. "Somewhat less than strictly legal, though there's no penalty attached to accessing the data at the level this will do for you. You should focus your search on the uninhabited areas between the Far North and Syndicate space, plus any nearby pirate systems. That's where we've noticed the most suspicious activity."`
			`	All business and technical explanation now out of the way you watch as the reality of what's happening seems to suddenly sink in and his demeanor changes suddenly as his eyes shine with faint hope, "And please, if you do find my wife Janitza... please bring her home."`
			choice

			`	After one last ride through the shuttles and trains of <origin>, you arrive at your ship. You plug the data card into your computer, and a new "government" shows up: Smuggler. The ships will be colored differently than pirates.`
			`	It may be risky, but you should disable one and board it.`

Since then, the symbol has been co-opted by miscreants.`
			`	"But you didn't come here for a theological history disquisition. The letters around the pentagram have been replaced with galactic coordinates using an archaic notation." She smiles at you, "I wrote my Ph.D. thesis about that notation! Now I finally need that information for something other than getting a degree!`
			`	"The circle around the symbol looks almost like a wormhole. A red wormhole. I heard about one in Terminus near The Deep. Apparently nobody is able to enter one without their ship being torn to pieces. This symbol suggests there's another one in the middle of Syndicate space.`

In the late 21st century, there was an effort to map stars in that intergalactic region. By all rights these stars should not have been so visible, but some strange anomaly made that part of the sky clearer for a while. The strangest thing we spotted was not a star; it was some kind of object with unknown properties that confused our scanners. Even today I'm not sure we'd make sense of it, but the anomaly passed, and we couldn't even make an attempt now."`

There's a huge network of caves and caverns coated with a crystal that is radiating... something the computer can't identify... and deuterium. The denizens of this system siphon the deuterium to make hyperspace fuel. Also, the planet has about a thousand times the mass it should, but somehow the gravity is around Earth normal."`

They have hydroponics, big cargo bays, docking bays for ships, and some spacious living areas.

			`The Earth authorities give you an unusual landing vector that leads to a secret docking bay below ground in Argentina. You land, and a Navy cadet meets you at your ship with an urgent message: "Republic Intelligence and a Navy Marshal want to see you as soon as possible. They have news about your microtransceiver transmissions. Please follow me."`
			`	Giti adds, "I'll take the scanners and data to some researchers and let you know when I have more information. Please go with the cadet. It sounds like you'll finally get some answers."`
			`	The cadet takes you to an elevator just outside your ship, down more than three hundred floors to a large meeting room. Within, you see two men and a woman in formal dress. One man has a Republic Intelligence uniform with the name "Agent Kopkow". Another wears a Navy full dress uniform that you don't immediately recognize. After a moment of thought, you realize he is a Marshal, the second-highest rank in the Navy, answering only to the Grand Marshal. His uniform is labeled "Adurath Kaine". The woman is a Navy captain wearing the prominent Parliamentary Medal of Valor. Her name label says "Captain Anna Wallace."`

			`	You've had few dealings with Republic Intelligence, but you know what everyone knows. They're the top police force of the Republic, dealing with high-profile civilian crimes that local authorities can't handle: murder investigations, interplanetary kidnappings, and the like. They also gather intelligence throughout human space, and possibly beyond, reporting directly to the Republic Parliament.`
			`	There are only five Navy Marshals, and one Grand Marshal; this man's high rank means he reports to Parliament regularly. People this high in the Navy tend to deal more with political issues rather than combat or strategy, so you wonder why they picked him to talk to you.`
			`	The Parliamentary Medal of Valor is only given to one person per year; this captain must have done something especially heroic. She must also have supporters in Parliament to receive the award in the first place. That will give her some freedom to act independently, like Danforth does.`
			`	The three of them are looking at you confused, wondering why you've stopped and stared at them for a half minute.`

			`	Marshal Kaine introduces himself. "I'm the Marshal of the Third Armada, the guards of the Far North and the uninhabited regions near it. I know you've met one of my admirals, Danforth that is, a good man - albeit one who flouts the rules a bit too much." He gives a stern look at Captain Wallace. "Some of my carriers have detected the signals you've found. Actually, we see them quite regularly in the ships of known slave runners. The runners don't always carry slaves; they do other smuggling missions as well."`
			`	Agent Kopkow speaks his piece next. "Sometimes the runners do carry slaves, and we have found humans or Hai in crashed slaver ships. We returned the Hai to their homes, as you did, but they didn't know Republic Intelligence helped them. Several merchants have done the same. About one in seven we rescued were researchers, which is an extremely disproportionate amount when you consider the number of researchers in human and Hai space. Clearly, they're being targeted."`
			`	Kaine continues, "That, unfortunately, is where we have some bad news. Parliament has a strict policy on pirates and slaver ships: destroy on sight. This is a tradition that goes back long before the era of space travel. Raiding pirate ships is a deadly affair; numerous Navy or police will be killed. While it may seem heroic, the casualty rate is unsustainable. The only effective way to discourage piracy is to destroy the ships. If you don't believe me, try catching some yourself and count your dead."`
			`	Captain Wallace concludes, "That means many slaves are killed, including some Hai researchers."`
			`	Kaine says, "We informed the Hai government while you were away, and they've responded by moving fleets towards the wormhole; we're doing the same. By the time you arrive, there will be large fleets on both sides of the wormhole. This could quickly lead to war. Please take the message back to Teeneep and the Hai victims with our condolences. Captain, please see <first> <last> back to the <ship>."`
			choice
				`	(Return to your ship.)`
			`	Along the way, Captain Wallace tells you stories of Navy heroism and brutality towards slaver vessels. Apparently many officers like her disagree with the Navy's policy. They want to rescue slaves whenever possible, regardless of risk or orders.`
			`	She was awarded for personally leading a charge deep into pirate space to rescue a group of over a hundred high-school students that were captured on a field trip to Shroud. That led to her court-martial and conviction for disobeying a direct order. She was pardoned by the Prime Minister upon receiving the Parliamentary Award for Valor.`
			`	When you reach your ship, she hands you a business card. "Please have the Hai victims talk to this man. He's part of Syndicate Internal Affairs and may be able to help. He and I... share common goals."`
