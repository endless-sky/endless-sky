Alondo in particular seems excited to be here and seems to have a knack for charming Sayari with polite and insightful, if rather simple, questions throughout the diplomatic niceties.`
			`	A functionary leads you to what appears to be a situation room, filled with monitors, holoprojectors, and other equipment. Everyone takes their seats at a semicircle-shaped table, and the functionary motions you to the middle seat. A massive holoprojector in front of the table turns on.`
			choice
				`	"I don't recall there being nearly so many pirates before."`
			`	Sayari frowns and exhales a long breath through her nose, "Yes. Well, it seems that the rumors making their way through your media have attracted every opportunist this side of the Deep."`
			`	"Of course," she says, "some of the pirates were aware of us, and we were aware of them being aware of us. We had a quiet arrangement with a select few where we rewarded them for keeping the secret well contained within their own circles."`
			`	Alondo looks surprised, and seems sufficiently taken aback to spare a questioning glance at Remington despite the deliberate lack of interaction between them so far. Remington's expression is unreadable though, and Mr. Yang and Ms. Adrianopolous both merely nod.`
			`	Sayari does not appear to notice the exchange. "Extra security forces are being called in, but we've been busier than usual in Wah Ki with our northern brethren."`
			choice
				`	"Are the other Hai likely to be a problem here?"`
				`	"How much longer can the Republic keep up the ruse?"`
					goto "bad news"
			`	Sayari shakes her head. "No problem remotely so severe as the one at hand. Now, I expect you have something for us, Mr. Yang?"`
			`	"Well, I'm afraid I may have some bad news from our side." He taps on his screen as he says, 'bad news,' and the holoprojector begins showing a series of charts.`
				goto charts

			`	"One of the things I brought with me was Republic Intelligence's estimate of the effectiveness of various information containment measures."`
			`	You're not an expert at data analysis, but the highlighted percentages ranging from 4% to 39% do not look promising. The final graphic is a map of stages of what is labeled as "artifact penetration." "Artifact penetration is the point at which a government cannot reasonably attempt to pretend something is anything but the truth, at least not while still holding to the claim of being a representative government," explains Mr. Yang.`
			`	He checks the date. "Our most optimistic estimates suggest the Republic will be forced to acknowledge the existence of the Hai within three months, or we would lose so much credibility as to compromise electoral stability. The actual time limit is probably sooner."`
			choice
				`	"Would that be so bad?"`
			`	"It is always bad to be forced into acknowledging a secret. If we act sooner, we may control the manner of that secret's release," says Xilin. "Plus, while the Hai have let the trickle of humans that find the wormhole settle here peacefully, a massive influx is a problem nobody really wants to have to deal with."`
			`	Sayari looks at you. "We will have to come up with a plan, and quickly, but for the moment may I ask a favor of the war hero in the room? Please meet up with the security forces converging on Allhome and help them rout the pirates back to the other side of the wormhole. It will buy us some breathing room and options."`

We've found a Seerwood producer who's willing to be all wounded on TV about the spoiling of his 'big surprise' release, and we're passing off the footage as leaked promotional material.
