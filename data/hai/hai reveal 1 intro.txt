			`	A functionary leads you to what appears to be a situation room, filled with monitors, holoprojectors, and other equipment. Everyone takes their seats at a semicircle-shaped table, and the functionary motions you to the middle seat. A massive holoprojector in front of the table turns on.`

			`	"Of course," she says, "some of the pirates were aware of us, and we were aware of them being aware of us. We had a quiet arrangement with a select few where we rewarded them for keeping the secret well contained within their own circles."`

"Artifact penetration is the point at which a government cannot reasonably attempt to pretend something is anything but the truth, at least not while still holding to the claim of being a representative government," explains Mr. Yang.`
			`	He checks the date. "Our most optimistic estimates suggest the Republic will be forced to acknowledge the existence of the Hai within three months, or we would lose so much credibility as to compromise electoral stability. The actual time limit is probably sooner."`
			choice
				`	"Would that be so bad?"`

	description "This modified Geocoris has identical cargo capacity, but is modeled off one that was the result of an alien technology being merged with a hybrid Human-Hai operating system. It has additional shield emitters in a geodesic pattern over its main cargo wings, and a crucial element of the ship's system core is not manufactured, but grown from initial samples taken from the first occurrence. This means that some systems are built-in and unable to be removed, and also that it is substantially more expensive than its regular version. It is, however, significantly more survivable."

The presence of Hai who won't take off their costumes has been attributed to a 'fan community' that have been hired on as a focus group to be there as part of the production. Despite all this, it is only a short-term solution. Asked by Sayari to look into a rumor about more kidnapped Hai. She does not consider it to be a particularly likely scenario, but her contacts insist.`

Of all of them, Alondo seems to be the least tired and takes the time to let you know what's been going on. "Captain <last>! You've missed quite the palaver. Still, I doubt you lost much. We've spent four hours trying to explain to Sayari what a 'furry' is."`

"Anyway, I have a hunch that we'll need you again before too long, but for now they're putting some Hai patrols out on the other side of the wormhole with a couple of Navy observers on board to 'play the part', as it were. We've got a plan now but there's some work to pull it off. There's some older counter-propaganda that we're leveraging to pass things off as a big budget movie production."`

			`	He pulls out a hand tablet and shows you a title screen which doesn't automatically look familiar. As he talks he flicks through a series of reference images. "There's an older TV show franchise with a cult following called 'Our Fuzzy Paradise', which has had a few different reboots and iterations over the decades. In case you haven't guessed, it features a whole cast of anthropomorphic squirrels. Most recently we had a seven season series run subtitled 'Fellowship is Glamorous' which was one of the more successful ones."`

					goto next
			`	"The production of the very first series was entirely funded through a government grants program though, as a cover for any accidental leaks about the Hai. Xilin tells me that since then it's pretty much run itself. The idea here is that since the last one was so successful, someone has decided that it's worth the risk to make a big budget movie production out of it and to potentially use that to kick off a sort of tourist trap type theme park destination. We've found a Seerwood producer who's willing to be all wounded on TV about the spoiling of his 'big surprise' release, and we're passing off the footage as leaked promotional material. For the sake of the cover, we've also decided that this project has a 'fan community' that have been hired on as a focus group to support the production for consistency and accuracy."`

			`	"I should not be coming to you with this, so you must promise to say nothing of it to anyone just yet," she says.`
			choice
				`	"Of course."`
			`	"A very sweet friend of mine, who is much too enthusiastic and perhaps led by the vagaries of youth but nonetheless quite astute, keeps harping on to me about this theory of hers that some kind of smuggling ring is kidnapping Hai and transporting them into human space with the quiet support of one of your legal entities.`
			`	"Of course, a thorough investigation has occurred on our side, and no admissible evidence of such things has turned up, but...`
			`	"Well, you see we cannot investigate your space openly or easily. I have paid it little mind, written it off as one of her eccentricities, but things are very tense right now. The Council of Elders wants to maintain our secrecy and the human diplomats are willing to accommodate us, but we sense their governments grow tired of maintaining the fiction. We are well aware that human intelligence services are highly competent, and motivated by many different factors. It worries me that one of your factions may not be wholly honest, and may have knowledge they intend to use as ammunition if things don't work out well for them."`

			`	"They're not. Well, it can be hard to tell sometimes, but no, I wouldn't say they're common. There have been instances in the past though where occasional pirate groups have been caught either trying or succeeding. My understanding is that those were dealt with effectively." She gives an odd shrug that is distorted by the cloak.`
			`	"Still, my friend is very bright, and she is insistent that there is something beneath the noise that cannot be accounted for by normal circumstances. There has been a spike in disappearances since the leak, and not necessarily on worlds where they could be expected to have got themselves into trouble. With recent events her words have begun to trouble me, especially after that raid on Allhome. Nothing like that has ever happened before," she says.`
