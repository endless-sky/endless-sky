While one could definitely argue in favor of his point, it doesn't carry much weight coming from a councilor whose system is a mere two jumps from a brand new Navy base.`

	`You are relaxing within the spaceport while your ship refuels after conducting a spot of business. On the view-screen is some talk show that you haven't previously encountered, but apparently seems to be quite a popular one out of Tarazed.`
	`	A young and fresh-faced man who looks incredibly ill at ease has just been brought out as a surprise guest by the host Jonathon Camembert.`
	`	"So now in our surprise segment, let me introduce you to Ronald Campbell. He once crewed on one of these big trade ships, but after seeing what he saw, he just had to come forward!"`
	`	The host stresses the word 'had' so much his voice squeaks, but the audience's attention has certainly been gained.`

	`	They show a short video featuring alien ships, not Pug, or Quarg, but something else. They are engaged in combat with each other, and fire weapons quite unlike anything produced in human space.`
	`	You raise your eyebrows. Actual footage of an unknown alien conflict doesn't seem likely.`
	`	When the clip ends, Campbell is encouraged by Camembert to talk about where he got the footage. Campbell is well presented, although his suit is definitely rented - you couldn't imagine how a crewman would be able to afford a suit like that on their salary - and he's clearly anxious. You can make out the beads of sweat on his brow as he considers his answer, and his neat suit is slightly crumpled in the way that happens when people wipe sweat off their palms a lot. When Campbell speaks, it is with a paranoid manner that is plain to see even through a screen. He talks at length about an ongoing conflict that threatens to spill over and drag all of humanity back to war; a war waged by an alien species known as the 'Hai'.`
	`	The idea that there's a directly accessible alien race, at war, that has also somehow been kept a secret, may just be a ridiculous rumor. Nevertheless, it is intriguing... You listen in to collect the relevant details for future reference.`
	`	It's difficult to be sure where you should start looking, but it seems that these 'Hai' are meant to be northward, and the biggest hub at that end of the known galaxy is Sunracer.`

He had apparently traveled many weeks before deciding to seek the media in order to avoid being shut down by Republic Intelligence if he contacted them elsewhere.

# Six possibilities for origin and destination, which works around bug 1938 - but also has coherency advantages.
# When other campaigns get added there will be even more possible combinations. As such the objective here is to matrix it out, so that all geographic starting points are defined by the missions - and then the conversations handle the combination of branches required for each campaign in a given geographic area. This makes it clearer and easier to work on and expand in the future when required.

			`	From above, this city has almost perfect radial symmetry, a sure sign that it was planned and built as a single unit rather than expanding at random over time. Every single building in the city is a dull and slightly irregular gray color, all made from the same material which seems to be some metallic alloy, and the corners of each building are slightly beveled instead of meeting at right angles.`
			`	Even the spaceport is symmetrical: a ring of hangars face outwards at evenly spaced intervals, while warehouses and living quarters dot the inside of the ring.`
			`	While the layout is utilitarian, it looks to be an incredibly comfortable place to live; the Hai have clearly given their individual community spaces quite a lot of character and life.`

Where a fleet has just returned from a recent battle, the hangars are lit with flashes from robotic welders as damaged hull plates are swapped out for fresh ones and weakened joints are reinforced.`

It has additional shield emitters in a geodesic pattern over its main cargo wings, and a crucial element of the ship's system core is not manufactured, but grown from initial samples taken from the first occurrence. This means that some systems are built-in and unable to be removed, and also that it is substantially more expensive than its regular version. It is, however, significantly more survivable."

The presence of Hai who won't take off their costumes has been attributed to a 'fan community' that have been hired on as a focus group to be there as part of the production. Despite all this, it is only a short-term solution. Asked by Sayari to look into a rumor about more kidnapped Hai. She does not consider it to be a particularly likely scenario, but her contacts insist.`

			`Arriving at the secure landing area on Hai-home, you are met by a group of relieved diplomats. Of all of them, Alondo seems to be the least tired and takes the time to let you know what's been going on. "Captain <last>! You've missed quite the palaver. Still, I doubt you lost much.

"Anyway, I have a hunch that we'll need you again before too long, but for now they're putting some Hai patrols out on the other side of the wormhole with a couple of Navy observers on board to 'play the part', as it were. We've got a plan now but there's some work to pull it off. There's some older counter-propaganda that we're leveraging to pass things off as a big budget movie production."`

			`	He pulls out a hand tablet and shows you a title screen which doesn't automatically look familiar. As he talks he flicks through a series of reference images. "There's an older TV show franchise with a cult following called 'Our Fuzzy Paradise', which has had a few different reboots and iterations over the decades. In case you haven't guessed, it features a whole cast of anthropomorphic squirrels. Most recently we had a seven season series run subtitled 'Fellowship is Glamorous' which was one of the more successful ones.`

				`	"Never mind. It sounds like you have that under control. What's next?"`
					goto next
			`	"The production of the very first series was entirely funded through a government grants program though, as a cover for any accidental leaks about the Hai. Xilin tells me that since then it's pretty much run itself. The idea here is that since the last one was so successful, someone has decided that it's worth the risk to make a big budget movie production out of it and to potentially use that to kick off a sort of tourist trap type theme park destination. We've found a Seerwood producer who's willing to be all wounded on TV about the spoiling of his 'big surprise' release, and we're passing off the footage as leaked promotional material. For the sake of the cover, we've also decided that this project has a 'fan community' that have been hired on as a focus group to support the production for consistency and accuracy."`

			`	Some hours later, you leave the fancy cocktail bar Alondo took you to and begin making your way back to your ship to sleep. Your cabin by far seems to be the best place to not be bothered.`

			`	"I should not be coming to you with this, so you must promise to say nothing of it to anyone just yet," she says.`
			choice
				`	"Of course."`
			`	"A very sweet friend of mine, who is much too enthusiastic and perhaps led by the vagaries of youth but nonetheless quite astute, keeps harping on to me about this theory of hers that some kind of smuggling ring is kidnapping Hai and transporting them into human space with the quiet support of one of your legal entities.`
			`	"Of course, a thorough investigation has occurred on our side, and no admissible evidence of such things has turned up, but...`
			`	"Well, you see we cannot investigate your space openly or easily. I have paid it little mind, written it off as one of her eccentricities, but things are very tense right now. The Council of Elders wants to maintain our secrecy and the human diplomats are willing to accommodate us, but we sense their governments grow tired of maintaining the fiction. We are well aware that human intelligence services are highly competent, and motivated by many different factors. It worries me that one of your factions may not be wholly honest, and may have knowledge they intend to use as ammunition if things don't work out well for them."`

			`	"They're not. Well, it can be hard to tell sometimes, but no, I wouldn't say they're common. There have been instances in the past though where occasional pirate groups have been caught either trying or succeeding. My understanding is that those were dealt with effectively." She gives an odd shrug that is distorted by the cloak.`
			`	"Still, my friend is very bright, and she is insistent that there is something beneath the noise that cannot be accounted for by normal circumstances. There has been a spike in disappearances since the leak, and not necessarily on worlds where they could be expected to have got themselves into trouble. With recent events her words have begun to trouble me, especially after that raid on Allhome. Nothing like that has ever happened before," she says.`
