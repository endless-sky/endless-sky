			`	From above, this city has almost perfect radial symmetry, a sure sign that it was planned and built as a single unit rather than expanding at random over time. Every single building in the city is made from the same metal alloy, a dull and slightly irregular grey color. The corners of each building are slightly beveled instead of meeting at right angles.`

The one major city that remains is the closest thing the Hai have to a military base, with new supplies of weapons and ammunition constantly pouring in from the rest of Hai space.`
			`	The spaceport has massive hangars and advanced repair facilities designed to accommodate the largest Hai warships. Where a fleet has just returned from a recent battle, the hangars are lit with flashes from robotic welders as damaged hull plates are swapped out for fresh ones and weakened joints are reinforced. The actual process of building these warships, however, takes place on the Hai homeworld, where the facilities will not be vulnerable to attack.`

Handling the Hai secrecy crisis has become his job while the majority of the foreign ministry remains engaged with the fallout from the Free Worlds and the recent peace.`
		conversation
			`On approach to the spaceport on Earth you communicate your need to speak to an official of significant standing on diplomatic business. Since you are not a diplomat this does cause some minor kerfuffle in the process, but thanks to your renown from the Pug war you are able to blow past such petty objections sufficiently so as to shortcut the process. The diplomatic ID from the box Sayari gave you doesn't hurt either.`
			`	The Republic Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs meets you in a hired, private room at the spaceport.`
			`	"Captain <last>," he steps around the table to grasp your hand in a firm handshake, "Xilin Yang, it's an honour to meet a war hero like yourself."`

			`	He offers you a genuine smile as he takes his seat.`
			label sit
			`	You take your seat opposite him and you get down to business. You explain how the Hai have proposed you be their official contact point for humanity on account of your fame from the war.`
			`	He asks a few questions for clarity and when you're done he requests if you'd kindly wait for a moment while he makes a call. It is a lengthy wait, and at one point an aide comes in and offers you refreshments while deliberations continue elsewhere. Much to your surprise the fruity beverage is actually quite light and not too sweet, reminding you briefly that this is actually the world where your major foods originally evolved.`
			`	Eventually Mr Yang returns, "So sorry for that, I hope you were looked after suitably while you waited."`
			`	Once you nod your assent he continues, "Well, obviously the Republic knows about the Hai, but for the moment our official line is that the government does not trade in rumours. However, clearly an appropriate response is needed. I have been informed that Republic Intelligence has gone through official channels to brief the Free Worlds Council just yesterday. They have demanded that they have a trained diplomatic representative along for any decisions. This is already standard practice for the Syndicate. If you are willing, I will come with you, and we shall meet two individuals known as Katya and Alastair on Deep and Foundry respectively. I believe you already know them?"`

			`Landing on Foundry you are communicated to on a private encrypted channel and directed to a private hangar where you are greeted personally by CEO Alastair Korban.`
			`	He smiles warmly, "Apologies Captain <last>, do excuse the cloak and dagger, but in the current media climate you and I are both too well known to be seen meeting without causing the rumour mill to grind out a new story."`

			`	"Of course," she says, "some of the pirates were aware of us, and we were aware of them being aware of us. We had a quiet arrangement with a select few where we rewarded them for keeping the secret well contained within their own circles."`
			`	Alondo looks surprised, but Mr Yang and Ms Adrianopolous both merely nod sagely.`
			`	"Extra security forces are being called in, but we've been busier in Wah Ki than usual lately."`

			`	He gestures to a display and then takes control when indicated.`
			`	"One of the things I brought with me was Republic Intelligence's estimate of the effectiveness of various information containment measures."`
			`	A series of charts are thrown up on the screen. You're not an expert at reading this sort of data but highlighted percentages ranging from as low as 4% to only as high as 39% do not look promising. The final graphic is a map of stages of what is labelled as 'artifact penetration'.`
			`	"Artifact penetration is the point at which a government cannot reasonably attempt to pretend something is other than the truth, at least not while still holding to the claim of being a representative government," explains Mr Yang.`
			`	He checks the date, "Our most optimistic estimates suggest the Republic will be forced to acknowledge the existence of the Hai within three months or lose so much credibility as to compromise elctoral stability, the actual time limit is probably sooner."`
			choice
				`	"Would that be so bad?"`
			`	"It is always bad to be forced into acknowledging a secret, if we act sooner we may control the manner of that secret's release."`
			`	Sayari looks at you, "We will have to come up with a plan, and quickly, but for the moment may I ask a favour of the war hero in the room? Please meet up with the security forces converging on Allhome, help them route the pirates back to the other side of the wormhole it will buy us some breathing space and some options."`
			`	It is so hard to say "no" to a Hai and their cute squirrelly features.`
