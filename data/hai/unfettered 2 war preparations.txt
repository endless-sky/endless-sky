There was no jump, no flash, nothing. It was just gone. Then, once our warships would depart it returned, always [harassing, plundering] us. The ghost managed to take on countless of convoys and escorts without issue, using its superior [technology, weaponry] and tactical advantages. But it was no real ghost. Everyone has a weakness. Its weakness was that while we could not see it, it did not mean that it was [not there anymore, gone]."`
			`	"With this in mind, the brave Unfettered laid a trap for the ship. When it [disappeared, cloaked], they stopped shooting like usual and acted in distress, making the ghost [arrogant, overconfident]. When it reappeared and moved toward the convoy, we were ready. The fleet arrived and blocked its [escape, cloaking]. The ghost ship disappeared, but it was too late. One of the convoy ships nearby [rammed, crashed] into it, which costed the life of the proud captain but revealed the ship. Then it was just a matter of [shooting it down, damaging it]. The cloaking device was damaged in the fight, or maybe it was already damaged before, knowing the ship never [disappeared, cloaked] for long, so we could not extract it from the wreckage. Instead, we built a ship based on that wreckage's materials, and the [damaged, incomplete] cloaking device remained installed."`
			`	"When you gave me the cloaking device, I started the preparations to install it on my ship, but it was not ready yet. It needs to fully [replace, overwrite] the old system, and that one is well integrated into the ship, so we may have to simply disable it if it cannot be replaced.

Looking at the brief scans you took of them he seems to discard that warning as if it was nothing, "I do not know how those aliens have obtained jump drives, they must have stolen them somehow. Once we have taken Wanderer space they will prove to be a very handy supply of new jump drives... I would not worry about their pathetic, although strange looking weapons.

			`	You explain to the herald that you have seen weird aliens in the north, the Pug, that have interfered with humanity in the past. He does not seem to believe you when you speak of technology capable of breaking down starlanes, "there is no way an alien race with such primitive ships would have that kind of technology. They must have simply abused your primitive sensors. They must have stolen the jump drives, and I only see that as an opportunity for later." You try to convince him he should not take them lightly, but he does not want to listen. "We have already done too much to prepare for war to turn back at the first sign of potential trouble. Still, I appreciate you taking this initiative of coming here to warn us, especially with this precise information. You seem to have learned the ways of my master quickly.`
