The ghost managed to take on countless of convoys and escorts without issue, using its superior [technology, weaponry] and tactical advantages. But it was no real ghost. Everyone has a weakness. Its weakness was that while we could not see it, it did not mean that it was [not there anymore, gone]."`

When it [disappeared, cloaked], they stopped shooting like usual and acted in distress, making the ghost [arrogant, overconfident]. When it reappeared and moved toward the convoy, we were ready. The fleet arrived and blocked its [escape, cloaking]. The ghost ship disappeared, but it was too late. One of the convoy ships nearby [rammed, crashed] into it, which costed the life of the proud captain but revealed the ship. Then it was just a matter of [shooting it down, damaging it]. The cloaking device was damaged in the fight, or maybe it was already damaged before, knowing the ship never [disappeared, cloaked] for long, so we could not extract it from the wreckage. Instead, we built a ship based on that wreckage's materials, and the [damaged, incomplete] cloaking device remained installed."`
