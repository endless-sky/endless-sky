			`	"You see," says Sayari, "while you've been away it's been decided that a 'tourist trap type theme park destination' is a critical part of the cover story." Despite her Hai inflections, you can still hear the air quotes around that phrase in the tone of her voice. "So far it seems the movie cover has been circulating quite successfully, so we're leaning into it.`
			`	"This means we need a station, on your side of the wormhole in Ultima Thule. It also means we need it fast, much faster than your people could ever hope to assemble it. The Hai can build it much quicker than humanity can; we actually considered the possibility of needing to raise a station quickly a while back. The alien look that the station will have if we build it has been considered just another favorable aspect of the movie and it provides a long-term commercial justification for the whole idea; the, uh, 'tourist trap.'"`

"In the light of the recent civil war your species has had, some of the Elders are less than keen on allowing a partisan observer to see the inner workings of a station in its earliest phases, especially when we haven't actually built one in so, so long."`
			`	Now that she mentions it, all of the stations in Hai space do seem to be very, very old.`
			`	"However, therein lies a problem," says Xilin.`
			`	"The Republic will not allow the Hai to build a station on our side of the wormhole without some oversight by someone we trust. This has now been a point of contention for some days, and multiple suggestions have been rejected."`
			`	Sayari chitters, "Honestly, it's all very silly. Lots of old men, who are meant to be friends, concerned that the other might have been lying to them."`
			`	In an oddly comical gesture, they both shrug at the same time.`

				`	"Is it me?"`
			`	Sayari winks at you. "Catch on quick, don't you? The actions you're recorded as having taken show a certain conscience for the good of your species as a whole, despite your affiliations. I have convinced the other diplomats and our Elders that you might be a viable solution to this impasse. The human diplomats have already agreed, but the Elders wish to speak with you first."`

The director they found, an eccentric chap called David Cohen, seems to have got quite enthusiastic now he's not busy bemoaning the 'big reveal' of his 'secret project.' There's a Mr Turner who's now the cover story's guy bankrolling the thing.`

We have to cover crews, staff, roles, extras; gauge needs for facilities, amenities, supplies, and livability requirements. We estimate they'll only get a third of that unless something changes."`
			`	As she's talking, Terry has been laying out charts and graphs while using a handheld Hai holographic device to show animated diagrams.`
			`	"The problem is that we need Hai who know how to interact with humans. We've had no shortage of Hai who are keen, even excited, at the prospect of acting in a human movie. Unfortunately, well, many of those Hai... have never met a human in their life. There's something off about their mannerisms and the way they interact; they're simply too alien...

With or without it, the Syndicate knows data. How else do you think we're so profitable?"`

It takes years of sharing a society with humans for a Hai to learn how to code-switch their body language for us, and humans that have lived solely with Hai and no other human contact are equally unsuitable. No, we cannot make unsuitable volunteers less alien. There's a different approach that can work though."`

We need to attract Hai who've lived in shared urban environments with humans enough to be able to fake being humans pretending to be Hai. Which means we need a human touch to this; it can't just come from the Hai's own advertising networks, and we need some star power. Oh, and if you haven't guessed already, you're the one to do it.

			`Before you leave, Alondo finds you in a hallway. "Captain <last>, come with me. We need to have a quick conference." You follow him to an unusual room with strange padding on all sides. He plugs a device with an attached keyboard into a wall-mounted monitor and types for a few seconds. Soon after, you see the familiar face of Katya.`
			`	"The transmission is secure," Alondo says. "This room has good soundproofing and some signal dampening. You can talk freely."`

			`	"Such a vast supply is unlikely to have come from individual smugglers, so we must assume it's the result of a large-scale operation. I'm worried the Hai government may be arming pirates. If they are, I hope the weapons are just misguided tribute payments. In the south, we well know how useful bounties and tributes are when dealing with pirates, but from my time as a councilor, I can tell you the Republic will not be so understanding.`
			`	"You must discreetly find out if the Hai government is arming the pirates and, if they are, put a stop to it. Don't tell them the Free Worlds asked you to do it, and whatever you do, don't let the Republic know. It could lead to an explosive diplomatic incident."`
