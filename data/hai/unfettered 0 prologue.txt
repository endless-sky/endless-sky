			`Looking outside, you see the sun is setting. You take a moment to admire the breathtaking view of the sun passing through some clouds of pollution and notice a large, white, square-shaped structure in the distance, perhaps some sort of stadium, which a growing crowd of Unfettered are streaming towards. Ships keep landing and unloading even more Hai all over the spaceport, so much so that, exiting your ship, you cannot avoid being caught up in the crowd. You are almost carried towards the building, which is grandiose compared to its surroundings and distinguished by its sheer length and pure white facade. In contrast, most of the surrounding structures appear to be houses or bars, all with more dilapidated appearances.`
			`	Something of great interest must be happening in this building, but not all the Unfettered in the crowd actually share your destination - many are instead breaking away to fill the nearby bars. Some simply wander aimlessly. Others are sitting on the rocky ground, chatting. Quite a few of them appear to be trading small quantities of goods between themselves.`

Given that the Hai are generally quite small in comparison to humans, you can already see some of what is going on inside over most of the crowd while waiting to filter inside. It seems much of the line is not for the seating itself; it instead heads directly to the central stage where a group of official-looking Unfettered Hai await.`
			`	When it is their turn in line, a couple towing four children with them, begin to plead. <firstgroup> The officials, perhaps the "Chiefs", which you have heard lead the Unfettered, speak among themselves. Then they turn back to the petitioners, and together, close their left hands and raise them up, before lowering them and opening their palms, as if presenting something. By the relief on the couple's faces, you assume their request has been granted.`

Or maybe he just exemplifies what you've heard about the ways of the Unfettered; they bow to no one.`
			`	The soldier moves away, and a tense silence hangs in the air for a moment. The Chiefs turn from the audience to speak among themselves, while mutterings and debate seem to be spreading throughout the crowd. This subject appears to be something for which strong opinions are held. The volume increases as the Chiefs continue their aside, and you begin to notice some of the nearby Hai turning their attention towards you, some even pointing you out. It may be that you are not welcome here. One of the younger Hai to notice you, probably still an adolescent judging by her colors, approaches you directly. She speaks softly, in your language, but clearly enough to be heard over the back and forth murmuring of the crowd.

			`	You begin to introduce yourself to her, but barely get your name out before you are both distracted as the proceedings resume. A child, younger - or at least smaller - than any other you've seen on stage so far, approaches the Chiefs. Also alone, the child seems scared and perhaps even lost as they speak, so softly even those on stage must be straining to hear. One of the Chiefs breaks ranks to kneel by the child, comforting them as they speak quietly to each other.`

However, he cannot do that alone, and the Chief is asking for someone to escort him, or find him a suitable transport. All Hai captains, even those who do not otherwise sympathize with our cause, would easily accept taking a child back to Hai space, without ever asking for anything in return.

Merora tells you, "This request bothers the Chiefs quite a bit, as he is not asking for a child to be transported but a full family, and not from here to Hai space but the opposite. A lot more money can be required to bring Hai here, because whilst many captains agree to bring us food for free, they prefer not to bring us more Hai, since for some it would mean condemning them to know hunger as well. As such, there are not as many captains ready to do this. The Chief said that currently no one is available, at least not at a suitable price. Later, they will most probably go and personally ask captains if it can be arranged."`

He presses a switch every so often which pops out a mirror, allowing him to peer cautiously around corners and obstacles in your path in case of an ambush.`

			`	Continuing up the mountain, more and more you get the impression that this vault is no simple, small depot. This is confirmed when you pass several security turrets, and, while it is safe to assume that even more defenses are hidden, you wonder why any would be left in plain sight around a "hidden" depot. Crossing a ridge, you begin to notice that some of your surroundings look strange, as the mountain has only been affected by the elements in some places and not others. Suddenly, the armored Hai stops and raises a hand high, palm open. Recognizing the sign, you stop as well.`
			`	The Hai reaches for some kind of device in his pocket and enters what you assume to be access codes. By the look on his face, it doesn't seem to be working very well.

We just have to go in, make sure they recognize us as friendlies, and then reactivate them." You really wonder where the vault could be, until you see the Hai walk right through part of the mountain in front of you. It must be a hologram, disguising the entry! You hurry to catch up to him.`
			`	At first, you don't notice anything particularly suspicious, but you do hear the low hum of running electronics and machinery in the distance. Though the vault is clearly alien in origin, you cannot pinpoint one race; instead, it seems to be a mix of many. All of it is very, very old, and there is no illumination, possibly because your friend cut all power. Even without light, you can tell there is clearly is space to move around - enough for an armored vehicle, in fact. As you acclimate to the darkness inside the vault, you notice a flash of green light, far away on your left.`

You can see his bloody knife, with what seems to be a snake on it, before losing consciousness.`

			`	After searching through the vault to eliminate any other surprises, the Hai declares the area cleared. Any other stalkers have probably run off after seeing the firepower your Unfettered friend carries. You then inspect the Jump Drives to the best of your ability with a device he quickly instructed you how to use, while he finishes taking care of the security systems. While waiting for him to return once you are done, you look around and notice a small symbol in the lower corner of a nearby wall: a dog with multiple heads. You double-check the Jump Drives as you continue to wait, and when the Hai captain comes back, he conveniently places his gun to hide the symbol. Best not to ask about it now.`
			`	He switches a lever, and the electric humming you've been hearing suddenly stops. "I have disabled the holographic field generator, so yer ship can come to pick up the drives.

I guess a lookout got away from the vault and contacted some friends..." Multiple alarms start going off, confirming his suspicions - hostile ships are launching and heading straight for you. You launch as soon as you can, rushing through the correct procedures. Meanwhile, the Unfettered captain joins you on the bridge, clearly used to being where the action is, invited or not, giving you advice.
