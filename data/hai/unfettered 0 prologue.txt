"It looks like you know what to do with a blade! I am Desneeparu, and it is a pleasure to meet you, captain <last>!" She exclaims herself, before laughing at your surprised face.

Many Hai are there, experimenting with small modifications, but never performing any extreme tests. Seeing your interest, the engineer explains, "We prefer to do most of our testing on the field of battle. Here we only make sure the weapon actually fires before Unfettered captains can get their hands on it." She points to where a few captains watch the tests; apparently satisfied with what they see, one even requests a weapon to be taken to their ship. You keep walking until you enter the outfitter section of the facility, where you notice the items on display are much more advanced than anything you have seen available on the surface. So much so it could almost pass for a 'normal' Hai outfitter, were it not for the overcharged, oppressive feel of the air, which is probably due to extensive weapon testing.`

Now that you have sold us multiple jump drives, I can tell you that we offer something much more valuable than money. For now, I can only offer you the mighty Tripulse Shredder, but eventually we will give you access to all kinds of weapons. Two Tripulse Shredders for one jump drive and our sympathy is the deal I propose," they say, presenting the weapons to you. Now that you can take a closer look, you notice these weapons seem fairly similar to the rest of Hai weaponry, but enhanced in one way or another.
