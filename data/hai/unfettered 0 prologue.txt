			`	In his hands he is holding a piece of foil paper. You recognize it as the wrapper from one of the food rations that you have been transporting to the Unfettered, the "tribute" that they demand from the peaceful Hai. But having never unwrapped one of the rations, you had not realized that there is writing on the inside, a few words in the angular alphabet of the Hai. The Unfettered youth sees your look of confusion, and translates the message. "It says, 'Hai-home is your home too. Rejoin your people.'"`
