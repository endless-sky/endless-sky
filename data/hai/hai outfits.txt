	description `Hai holographic outfits are made up of a set of individual "holopads" which work together to create a larger scene. The Phantom Pallet is an Unfettered variation of these holopads, durable enough to survive a firefight and easily hidden under floors, in walls, or in ceilings while remaining undetected. An enterprising privateer might pad their cargo bay with these and project fake cargo as sensor ghosts, confusing scanners into scanning empty space instead of contraband; that extra time has been known to make the difference between seized cargo and delivering needed supplies.`

	description "Hai holographic technology far exceeds the comparable human equivalents, and nowhere is this best exemplified than in the Holovid Zone. Its holographic projectors and textured force fields present lifelike visuals, while phase array speakers emanate sounds from anywhere in the room."
	description "	For the Hai, such technology is commonplace, being used to create 3D conference rooms, holovid theaters, gaming arcades, and more. In the past, Hai captains used to install Holovid Zones on their command deck, allowing them to generate tactical evaluations of battles in real-time."
	description "	The possibilities are endless... especially for a sly captain who misuses the device. Should authorities seek contraband or illegal outfits, a Holovid Zone may fool them long enough for a smuggler to escape. Deathsticks are hard to find in a ship with fifty tons of holographic straw."

	description "An early stage in the development of better and faster weaponry to rival that of the Wanderers, the Tripulse Shredder consists of three Pulse Cannons in a single housing. Advancements in cooling capabilities have reduced the heat generated by each shot at the cost of drawing slightly more power. Additionally, the single shared housing results in a less consistent firing pattern, limiting it to bursts. These factors have made the Tripulse Shredder a popular hit-and-run weapon among the Unfettered."

	description "The Unfettered conflict with the rest of the Hai has put pressure on them to gain a technological edge, despite their limited resources. The Ionic Blaster is a result of that pressure. It is much smaller than the venerable Ion Cannon, while also doing more raw damage for its size. It also is still able to apply some of the same energy draining effects, but Unfettered scientists have pushed it towards a higher relative focus on jamming enemy weapons."

There's probably a cultural component to the joke that many miss, because it's told quite often and the Hai laugh hysterically about it - every time."
