# For Hai shipyards their "Advanced" ships are restricted to the planets where the ships are actually manufactured.
# In the case of "Intermediate" shipyards being required, those should be restricted to planets with substantial industrial bases.
# The basics are those which can (but might not) be exported and sold pretty much anywhere that could provide reasonable maintenance services.
