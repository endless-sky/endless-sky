			`	Around you, the station appears to be prospering. A strong undercurrent of excited anticipation that seems to buoy everyone along as they go about their business.`
			`	"Hiyamaharu here has been telling me stories about these so-called 'Wanderers' you've been off gallivanting with."

			`	He waves his hand dismissively and continues.`
			label main
			`	"In any event," Xilin continues, "Hiyamaharu and I would like you to do something. You completed a similar task when this station was first built.`
			`	"The pirate threat to ships traveling to and from Hai space is just as bad as it ever was, possibly worse for the increased number of ships. So, on top of a mountain of legalese, an endless stipulation of trade obligations, and a nightmare of judicial jurisprudence jurisdiction boundaries, there is a very physical and tangible action that needs to be taken.`
			`	"The Navy base on Farpoint helps to limit the mobility of pirates coming from the Far North, but there is no restraint other than distance to put a check on the pirates that come out of Stormhold. Something needs to be done to secure the space lanes, and so the solution that has been agreed upon is to build a station in Cardax. The volume of pirate activity there is intense enough that the Hai's rapid ship conversion approach to building a station is the only really viable approach."`
			choice
				`	"So what am I going to do?"`
			`	"Well," says Hiyamaharu, "the number of ships involved in this represents a considerable investment, and we'd hate for them to be destroyed during a vulnerable construction phase. The prior concerns about human agents observing the inner core of the station also continue to apply.`
			`	"So, we would like you to escort a security force and the core Geocoris to the site in Cardax, clear out any threats in the system, and get the ship through the first construction phase so it can safely raise its shield again. Once that has been completed, the rest of the Geocoris will travel with their escort to join you. You and the security force will have to protect the station while the rest of the convoy arrives to finish the construction."`
			choice
				`"Why not just send all of them with their entire escort at once? Surely that would be safer?"`
			`	Xilin shrugs. "We've heard a rumor that the pirates might have caught wind of what we're doing. The reality is that the marauders up here can field a truly formidable force, if they get their act together. They've overrun the Navy outpost on Farpoint a number of times before, and it would be devastating if an entire naval flotilla, the Hai construction fleet, and a whole security force were all caught out in the open by such a fleet, possibly attacked from both sides.`
			`	"By separating them, we're less likely to tip them off as to when exactly we choose to act, and once the station is up, the fleet can use the station's projector and facilities to support their presence. Plus, if they are tipped off already and we can't deal with them, then we only lose the one Geocoris. We expect that you and the Hai security ships are capable enough to escape from trouble if it's more than you can handle."`
			choice
				`	"Makes sense."`
				`	"I suppose..."`
			`	"The Geocoris and security force are ready whenever you are. Be safe out there <last>, and remember: we can't have any pirates observing the construction."`

			`With a strong force ensuring that no one can interrupt the final construction stage, space-based cranes set about removing the three outer sections of the Geocoris and moving them to the steel ring deployed around the original station core. Within a few hours, all seven of the new Geocoris have been dismantled and integrated to the station structure, using lessons learnt from the construction of Mountaintop to rapidly finish a station that is fully battle-ready, if lacking in some of the amenities of life. In an unexpected reversal of the Mountaintop priorities, the construction workers unpack and assemble a massive holoprojector while wearing environmental suits before they begin unpacking the contents of the Geocoris storage pods and engaging principle life support systems.`

Obviously, I wanted no part of the ambassadorial business to the Republic, but when all this Hai business started up well, let's just say they struggled to find anyone qualified. As it turns out, someone in the senate doesn't particularly like me, and they've been using my extended time away up here to try and influence the diplomatic corps. Meanwhile, the Hai want the Free Worlds to have some involvement with this station we're on so that everyone is tied in, but obviously the Free Worlds don't particularly care when they could hardly be further from it.`
			`	"I have devised a compromise: the Free Worlds will not supply ships to the garrison, but they will instead sponsor both Kraz and Delta V, primarily based in the south, to set up outfitters here, with full upfront costs paid by the Free Worlds government.

			`Arriving on <origin> once again brings with it full diplomatic regalia. The gallery "Where Mountains Touch The Sky" is filled to the brim with a great many representatives from the Core and Paradise worlds, and some of the more notable representatives from the Syndicate and Free Worlds. The entire Hai Elder Council is in attendance, and the Chancellor of the Free Worlds and President of the Republic are again schmoozing about in their most respectable suits. Alondo, Xilin, and Hiyamaharu have their symbols of office, and it looks like the Free Worlds have now finalized their design for Alondo's.`
			`	The speeches in the grand Borealis Chamber turn out to be rather long and dry. Teeneep makes an appearance along with one of the other Elder Hai, whom you think you recognize as the one who asked you strange questions once before. Only the Republic President makes a head of state address, but the highest officer of the Navy also makes an address on the value of the Mooncreek station to the security of both nations and the benefits of long-term cooperation with mutual friends.`
			`	You are asked to stand for a great many photos, make occasional comments, and shake an absolutely endless series of hands. Xilin is kind enough to make sure you get some of the better hors d'oeuvres in between exchanging pleasantries.`
			`	When it's over, Xilin and Hiyamaharu quietly inform you that you have a reward of <payment> for your earlier efforts setting up Mooncreek. You're free to go back about your business now.`

Outside of outfitters, there are few shops or other services catering to civilians, and a very busy section devoted to the fighter groups that mine the asteroids here to keep the outfitters supplied with basic resources for manufacture.`
