				`	"Just that I'm good looking."`
			`	"There we go!" says the man who was fiddling with the holoprojector as it whirs to life. "No time for introductions. We're late enough as is. Everyone, please sit down."`
			`	The holoprojector displays a series of graphs. You're no expert in data analysis, but a highlighted "chance of total crisis" at the bottom ranging from 61% to 96% does not look promising.`
			`	"Please turn your attention to this chart here," he says while pointing to a bar graph. "We've continued to track the number of new arrivals to Hai territory. As noted on the left, the number of new monthly arrivals was in the low hundreds prior to the leaks being broadcast. Within only a short time after, that number quickly rose to the thousands. Mitigation efforts by the Navy to dissuade civilian captains from discovering the wormhole in Ultima Thule by circulating reports of increased pirate activity have since suppressed this number somewhat, but the rate of new arrivals is still well above what it once was.`
			`	"It has been noted that the character of these new arrivals is also different. Where once a majority of new arrivals were lone explorers or lost captains, they are now increasingly captains following breadcrumbs while looking for the Hai or bringing large groups of 'tourists' with the promise of witnessing the aliens from the news reports. Further research will need to be done to determine the threat that these new arrivals pose in continuing to escalate the situation."`
			choice
				`	"What's the problem with new arrivals?"`
				`	"Do we not have a way of blocking captains from entering the wormhole?"`
					goto block
			`	"We do not have the means of handling a large influx of humans," says the Hai. "For decades, we have dealt with a small trickle of humans arriving through the wormhole. We have grown accustomed to it. But if that trickle were to suddenly become a downpour, then our services would quickly become overrun."`
			`	The man presenting the graphs nods in agreement. "Of importance is also the effect that this situation may have for the Republic," he says while pointing at another graph labeled "artifact penetration" which shows a map of various stages of events and their outcomes.`
				goto continue
			label block
			`	"We could get the Navy to blockade the wormhole," says Alondo, "but such an overt action would be no different than outright stating to everyone that Campbell was telling the truth, which could easily lead to civil unrest after the events of the Pug invasion."`
			`	The man presenting the graphs nods in agreement. "Precisely my next topic," he says while pointing at another graph labeled "artifact penetration" which shows a map of various stages of events and their outcomes.`
			label continue
			`	"Artifact penetration is the point at which a government cannot reasonably attempt to pretend something is anything but the truth, at least not while still holding to the claim of being a representative government. Our most optimistic estimates suggest the Republic may be forced to acknowledge the existence of the Hai within three months, or we would lose so much credibility as to compromise electoral stability. The actual time limit is probably sooner."`
			choice
				`	"What are the plans to prevent that?"`
					goto plans
				`	"Would that be so bad?"`
			`	"It is always bad to be forced into acknowledging a secret. If we act sooner, we may control the manner of that secret's release," he says. "Plus, while the Hai have let the trickle of humans that find the wormhole settle here peacefully, a massive influx is a problem nobody really wants to have to deal with.`
			label plans
			`	"We are currently still gathering information and weighing various potential options. Complete containment of this situation may already be impossible, and so plans which aim for that may not be worth following. If so, we would instead follow the plans which seek to formally reveal the existence of the Hai to humanity in as controlled a manner as possible. Only time will tell if that is the case, though."`
			`	After the briefing is finished, the Hai woman approaches you. "Greetings, Captain <last>. I am grateful that you will be helping us. My name is Sayari. I was the envoy to the human government a century ago." The present situation is all the evidence needed to make it clear that the Republic has never mentioned the Hai, nor publicly acknowledged receiving an envoy from them.`
			`	Before you can get into a conversation with Sayari, the presenter butts in. "Yes, yes, and I have a task for you to be helpful with now. Please meet me outside at the port," he says before swiftly leaving the room.`
			`	Sayari chuckles. "So much on that human's mind. I have not seen him take a break since he has arrived. It is as if he is more stressed about this situation than any Hai."`

			`The rate at which new ships show up isn't tremendous, so Xilin starts by speaking with some of the older captains who have been here prior to the news. "You can learn a lot by sharing a drink with the right merchant," he says to you.`
			`	One captain in particular has been camped out here to intercept new captains as they arrive and give them the induction tour. He also has a copious set of notes that he gladly shares with Xilin. "After I heard the news, I figured I'd help by keeping notes on new arrivals. They make themselves very obvious with the way they gawk," he says. "We had two new ships come in yesterday, a Freighter and an Osprey, but there's been nothing today as of yet. It's normally only one or two smaller ships a day, if that."`
			`	Xilin decides to next search the spaceport for captains that showed up recently, but just before heading off, a Star Queen full of passengers lands in the spaceport with everyone on board pressing their faces against the windows.`

			`	"Welcome, one and all, to the land of the Hai," the ship's captain says while walking down the boarding ramp with all her passengers behind her.`
			`	"Excuse me, Captain. Do you care to answer a few questions?" Xilin shouts up to the captain. She looks concerned to see Xilin standing there in a Republic uniform, but agrees to talk after shooing her passengers off into the spaceport.`
			`	"What is it you need to know, officer?" the captain asks.`
			`	Although Xilin isn't a Navy officer, he doesn't correct her. "I'd like to know why it is that you decided to bring all these passengers who had never been to Hai space before."`

			`	"No," Xilin says while looking away. "But they might be."`
			`	You follow Xilin's gaze to see a beat-up Berserker that looks like it can barely fly landing in the spaceport. "You're free to go," Xilin says to the Star Queen captain.`
			`	You approach the Berserker as it finishes landing. The captain of the ship exits looking far calmer than the condition of the Berserker would suggest he should be. "Uh, hi," he says awkwardly. "Can I help you guys?"`
			choice
				`	"What happened to your ship?"`
				`	"Did you get attacked by pirates on the way here?"`
			`	The captain looks back at the poor state of his interceptor. "Oh, that. Yeah, I ran into a couple pirates on the way here. Nothing I haven't dealt with before, though."`
			`	"So you've been to Hai space before?" Xilin asks.`
			`	"Sure. Plenty of times," he responds.`
			`	Xilin looks over the interceptor with a quizzical expression. "May I see your pilot's license?"`
			`	"Yeah, no problem," the captain says, as he quickly pulls a license out of his pocket that looks almost as beat up as the interceptor. Xilin jots down the details and hands the license back to the captain. "Thank you. And maybe tag along with a merchant fleet on your way back home."`
			`	"That sounds like a good idea," the captain says before walking off into the spaceport.`
			`	You continue to question more captains in the spaceport over the course of the day with Xilin and Sayari. Most turn out to be repeat visitors or those who have taken to conducting their business entirely in Hai space, but they are all familiar with arrivals who heard of the way to the Hai through whispers in spaceport bars or were sold coordinates by knowledgeable captains, and many are able to provide information about these encounters. It seems that everyone has been peaceful enough in interacting with the Hai so far, but clearly the word is getting out more as time goes on.`

"Why are you guys hiding up here?" "Where can I buy some of those weapons of yours?" "Do you eat acorns?" Some of the Hai look intrigued by the attention they're being given, but others look annoyed.`
