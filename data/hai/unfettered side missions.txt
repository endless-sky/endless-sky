			`	To your surprise, the local train station is located underground. You can't begin to make sense of the enormity of it - it almost feels like you can reach the entire planet from here. You ask a Hai for directions, feeling embarrassed when you learn that all you had to do was scan your ticket at a nearby terminal and all relevant information would be displayed for you.`
			`	After departing the train station, you hike for a few hours until you reach your destination. Upon arriving, you look around for the stranger. Besides a cave, some sparse vegetation, and of course the beach itself, you cannot see anything significant in the vicinity. You double-check that these are the right coordinates and look around some more.`
			`	You wait for some time until you spot two hooded figures further down the beach, and you start to doubt whether or not this was a good idea as they make their way toward you. Even when they're close enough to speak, their faces somehow remain impossible to glimpse beneath the hoods. "Hello, <last>," one says to you.

Crystals embedded in the walls cast a faint blue glow as you follow them, until you approach a large chamber where sunlight breaks through cracks, revealing another ship.

The first one seems surprised by this and tries to intervene, but the second resumes before they can speak up.`
			`	"These legendary weapons can interfere with nearly any engine system! Worry not, you'll be able to recuperate the cost of this ship with ease by assisting us. A load of medical supplies is needed on <destination>, and we lack the time and personnel to bring them ourselves on such short notice.`
			`	"Of course, the ship is aged, and you should not expect the best price in a shipyard. Nevertheless, it is a fine vessel, capable of fighting, freighting, and mining. So, what do you say, <last>? This is the opportunity of a lifetime; they simply don't make ships like this anymore."`

			`As you land, countless Hai hastily head to your ship, each armed with several weapons. One of them points at you and makes a declaration in front of the crowd that is quickly forming, shouting loud enough for all to hear. "You do not deserve to fly this relic of old!"`
			`	One standing behind them then chimes in. "You wasted your opportunity for a glorious battle to earn that right! We know of what you've failed!"`

			`	A more important-looking Unfettered then steps up close to you, speaking in a menacing tone. "You must surrender the ship to us immediately, along with the weapons of the savages, if you did not already rob us of those." For a moment, they look down in thought, then speak to you once more. "We will give you another ship so you can leave, but you must give us the Anomalocaris!"`

			`	You and your crew exit what was briefly your ship, and the local Unfettered militia are informed that it is now theirs. The Unfettered that were assembling around your ship happily disperse, except for one - probably the leader, judging by the amount of weaponry on their person. They come to talk to you, weapons in hand but lowered. "We are happy you could see reason and decided to hand over the ship. In exchange, we will provide you with a suitable replacement.`
			`	"That relic was not meant for you, but there are other ways for you to prove yourself to us." The leader of these Unfettered continues with blatantly forced casualness. "Say, for example, bringing us a Jump Drive... or two... that for sure will earn you favor, and prove you can fight."`

			`	The leader of the Unfettered group then has a few of them escort you to the edge of the spaceport. On your way there, some of them seemed to be holding back some frustration, and you could have sworn one wanted to attack you at any moment. Eventually you are lead to a landed Lightning Bug, and after some messy paperwork, the Unfettered leave it with you.`
