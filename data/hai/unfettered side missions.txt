"Keep walking," the stranger hisses. After pointing at and commenting on random ships, as if to mimic the actions of a regular passerby, they address you again. "My associates and I have a lucrative business proposition for you. If you are interested, come find us at these coordinates." Without waiting for a response, they fold a piece of paper into your hand before quickly fading into the crowd. It lists only a location, and if you cross-reference it with the local maps, it appears to point towards a beach on the other side of the planet.`

			`	To your surprise, the local train station is located underground. You can't begin to make sense of the enormity of it - it almost feels like you can reach the entire planet from here. You ask a Hai for directions, feeling embarrassed when you learn that all you had to do was scan your ticket at a nearby terminal and all relevant information would be displayed for you.`
			`	After departing the train station, you hike for a few hours until you reach your destination. Upon arriving, you look around for the stranger. Besides a cave, some sparse vegetation, and of course the beach itself, you cannot see anything significant in the vicinity. You double-check that these are the right coordinates and look around some more.`
			`	You wait for some time until you spot two hooded figures further down the beach, and you start to doubt whether or not this was a good idea as they make their way toward you. Even when they're close enough to speak, their faces somehow remain impossible to glimpse beneath the hoods. "Hello, <last>," one says to you.

Crystals embedded in the walls cast a faint blue glow as you follow them, until you approach a large chamber where sunlight breaks through cracks in the walls, revealing another ship.

The first one seems surprised by this and tries to intervene, but the second resumes before they can speak up.`
			`	"These legendary weapons can interfere with nearly any engine system! Worry not, you'll be able to recuperate the cost of this ship with ease by assisting us. A load of medical supplies is needed on <destination>, and we lack the time and personnel to bring them ourselves on such short notice.`
			`	"Of course, the ship is aged, and you should not expect the best price in a shipyard. Nevertheless, it is a fine vessel, capable of fighting, freighting, and mining. So, what do you say, <last>? This is the opportunity of a lifetime; they simply don't make ships like this anymore."`

			`	A more important-looking Unfettered then steps up close to you, speaking in a menacing tone. "You must surrender the ship to us immediately, along with the weapons of the savages, if you did not already rob us of those." For a moment, they look down in thought, then speak to you once more. "We will give you another ship so you can leave, but you must leave the Anomalocaris with us!"`

The Unfettered that were assembling around your ship happily disperse, except for one - probably the leader, judging by the amount of weaponry on their person.

			`	"That relic was not meant for you, but there are other ways for you to prove yourself to us." The leader of these Unfettered continues with blatantly forced casualness. "Say, for example, bringing us a Jump Drive... or two... that for sure will earn you favor, and prove you can fight."`

			`You see the sun slowly disappear into the horizon as you land on this planet, indicating it is already night here. Shortly after exiting your ship, you see a group of Unfettered Hai sitting on the side of the path, eating corn around a campfire. One of them, probably the youngest, judging by their size, tries to get your attention by calling you repeatedly. "Captain, Captain! Can you tell me stories about how you used great cunning to beat a swarm of Lightning Bugs?" Another one, probably their parent, then speaks up. "Come, sit with us. I am sure there is much to be said about that great relic from our past."`
			`	You start to explain how the fight went, but before you can explain much, the young one interrupts you, speaking to the others. "See? There is no way they lost the ship, if they fought so well with it!" The parent speaks again, trying to console the child. "That great ship may be lost, but everything has to end at one point, and its time of glory was already behind it."`
			choice
				`	"How did you learn about the loss of the ship?"`
				`	"Nonsense. I still have the ship."`
			`	The elder of the group speaks, raising her hand to gather attention, her tone commanding respect. "That ship had an emergency locator, a relic of an age where the Hai Empire was fighting wars on different fronts, and we needed a way to find a ship if its crew had been lost in battle. It sent a short signal, meaning it was either taken apart or destroyed. Tell me, which is it?" As she says this she looks at you deep in the eye, as if she was gazing into your soul.`
			choice
				`	"It was lost in a great battle!"`
				`	"I sold the ship."`
					goto sold
			`	She seems proud, "At least it got the end it deserved!"`
				goto leave
			label sold
			`	"You... what? One of the most important relics of my people, and you just sold it? At least you had the courage to earn it, young human."`
			label leave
			`	She looks around, and as she does you notice more Unfettered Hai than before, talking in little groups and looking your way regularly. She gets up, and continue, in a stronger tone, "It would be wise for you to leave now, wait for things to calm down." You head back to your ship, and thankfully nobody seems be following you.`
