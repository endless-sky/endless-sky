			`	In his hands he is holding a piece of foil paper. You recognize it as the wrapper from one of the food rations that you have been transporting to the Unfettered, the "tribute" that they demand from the peaceful Hai. But having never unwrapped one of the rations, you had not realized that there is writing on the inside, a few words in the angular alphabet of the Hai. The Unfettered youth sees your look of confusion, and translates the message. "It says, 'Hai-home is your home too. Rejoin your people.'"`

	description "This sensor-laden exploration vessel hails back to a more peaceful era of the Hai. Though they have no true ramscoop, a technology the Hai never developed, their built-in collection gills magnify the natural ramscoop present in all ships. These expensive features are the reason the ship has been replaced with the Lightning Bug."
	description "This ship is now appropriate as an agile, long distance, cargo hauler and blockade runner. It is able to defend itself in small skirmishes, even though you suspect that it does not operate at its full potential, as if it stayed underwater for some time... The simple fact that it is still running at all after so many years is clearly proof of the durability of Hai technology."

			`As you enter the shipyard you quickly get approached by someone wearing a hood, apparently not too keen to reveal their identity. They come to address you, discreetly. Seeing you stop to listen, they take your arm and make you follow them. "Keep walking," they say, quickly taking a look around the way someone looking for a new ship would, before addressing you again. "Me and my associates have a business proposition for you, if you are interested to learn more about it go to these coordinates." They give you a piece of paper containing the location, on a beach almost on the other side of the planet with an instruction to not go with you ship, before quickly fade in the crowd. Will you go there?`
			choice
				`	(Sure.)`
				`	(Maybe another time.)`
					defer
			`	You proceed to hire a motorized antigrav vehicle to go there, and by the time you arrive it starts being dark. You set foot after double checking you are indeed at the right coordinates, for except a cave, vegetation, sand, and, of course, the beach, you cannot see much of interest in the vicinity. You can't help but put your hand close to your gun, feeling safer with its presence.`
			`	After waiting for what seems like an eternity you start to hear whisper, and two hooded figures approach you. You start to doubt whether or not this was a good idea but it is probably too late to back down now. They come to address you, their face hidden by the now almost total obscurity. "Hello, <last>," they say at the same time, almost in a comical way, removing some of the tension you felt until now. Then they look at each other, nod, and one of them addresses you in a more serious mood. "We are sorry for all of these complications, but the truth is we cannot afford to take risks. It has been some time since we stopped trying to understand, and started taking every precaution we could to be safe. You see, we simply do not know you, and neither do you us."`
			choice
				`	"Tell me more."`
					goto tellme
				`	"How do you know me?"`

			`	They seem surprised at your sudden change of mind, but make no effort to stop you. You proceed to take the antigrav back to the shipyard without any incidents.`

			`	"We have a very interesting proposition for you: should you agree to bring supplies to our brethren, the Unfettered Hai, we will offer you a ship, for a modest price of 6.5 million credits. This is a very useful ship, and you should be able to repay this quite easily by running more of the same kind of jobs. It is indeed appropriate for bringing this important food cargo safely to destination, and even defend yourself, if need be. You see, these supplies are needed on short notice, on <destination>, and we lack the time and personnel to bring them."`
			`	They take you into the cave, finally showing the ship they were referring to. "This is a mighty relic of the past, from the times our Empire used to control the stars; a Ladybug!`
			scene "thumbnail/hai ladybug"
			`	"Of course, it has some... drawbacks, compared to its golden time, and don't expect the best price in a shipyard either. Nevertheless it is a fine vessel, capable of safely taking a respectable amount of cargo across large distances! So, what do you say, <last>? This is the opportunity of a lifetime, as they simply don't make ships like these anymore!"`

"It is of no real significance, but surely you understand we cannot go trough official means for this, we will have to present it as a fine. Worry not, we will make it something of no consequence, like an old Korath forbidden tech you would not have known about, that we had to confiscate."`
			`	You quickly realize they are not asking you for your opinion at all. In fact, you notice the fine has already been issued before you could say anything. "Oh, and you should not change its colors, you'll understand why later."`
