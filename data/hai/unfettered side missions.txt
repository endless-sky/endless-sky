	description "This sensor-laden exploration vessel hails back to a more peaceful era of the Hai. Though they have no true ramscoop, a technology the Hai never developed, their built-in collection gills magnify the natural ramscoop present in all ships. These expensive features are the reason the ship has been replaced with the Lightning Bug."
	description "This ship can be used as an agile, long distance cargo hauler and blockade runner. It is also able to defend itself in small skirmishes, even though it can no longer operate at its original full potential. Having stayed underwater for such a long time, the simple fact that it is still running at all is proof of the durability of Hai technology."
