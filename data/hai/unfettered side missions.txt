The first one seems surprised by this and tries to intervene, but the second resumes before they can speak up.

We will instead present it as a fine. You'll be charged for carrying Korath tech you had no idea was forbidden, and it will not go on your permanent record.

They come to talk to you, weapons in hand but lowered. "We are happy you could see reason and decided to hand over the ship. For this, we have decided to provide you with a suitable replacement, that should hopefully allow you to exit our space safely.`
