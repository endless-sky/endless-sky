	description "This sensor-laden exploration vessel hails back to a more peaceful era of the Hai. Though they have no true ramscoop, a technology the Hai never developed, their built-in collection gills magnify the natural ramscoop present in all ships. These expensive features are the reason the ship has been replaced with the Lightning Bug."
	description "This ship can be used as an agile, long distance cargo hauler and blockade runner. It is also able to defend itself in small skirmishes, even though it can no longer operate at its original full potential. Having stayed underwater for such a long time, the simple fact that it is still running at all is proof of the durability of Hai technology."

After pointing at and commenting on a, likely, random ship with little conviction, they address you again. "My associates and I have a lucrative business proposition for you.

You start to doubt whether or not this was a good idea, but it is probably too late to back down now. As they approach close enough to address you, their faces somehow remain impossible to even glimpse beneath their hoods. "Hello, <last>," they say at the same time, almost in a comical way, removing some of the tension you felt until now. Then they look at each other, nod, and one of them addresses you in a more serious tone. "We are sorry for all of these complications, but the truth is, we cannot afford to take risks.
