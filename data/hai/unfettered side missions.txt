You recognize it as the wrapper from one of the food rations that you have been transporting to the Unfettered, the "tribute" that they demand from the peaceful Hai. But having never unwrapped one of the rations, you had not realized that there is writing on the inside, a few words in the angular alphabet of the Hai.

"Keep walking," the stranger hisses. After pointing at and commenting on random ship, as if to mimic the actions of regular passerby, they address you again. "My associates and I have a lucrative business proposition for you. If you are interested, come find us at these coordinates." Without waiting for a response, they fold a piece of paper into your hand before quickly fading into the crowd. It lists only a location: a beach on the other side of the planet.`

			`	After waiting for some time, you spot two hooded figures further down the beach making their way toward you. You start to doubt whether or not this was a good idea, but it's too late to back down now. Even, when they're close enough to speak, their faces somehow remain impossible to glimpse beneath the hoods. "Hello, <last>," one says to you.

"We have a proposition for you: should you agree to bring much needed supplies to our brethren, the Unfettered Hai, we will sell you this ship for the modest price of 10 million credits, including 2 very powerful Korath Detainers!" The first one seems surprised by this and tries to intervene, but the second resumes before they can speak up. "These legendary weapons can interfere with nearly any enemy engine system to give you a significant maneuverability advantage. Worry not, you'll be able to recuperate the cost of this ship with ease by bringing medical supplies to the Unfettered. This cargo is needed on short notice, on <destination>, and we lack the time and personnel to bring them.`
			`	"Of course, the ship is aged, and you should not expect the best price in a shipyard. Nevertheless, it is a fine vessel, capable of fighting, freighting, and mining. So, what do you say, <last>? This is the opportunity of a lifetime; they simply don't make ships like this anymore."`

We will instead present it as a fine. You'll be charged for carrying Korath tech you had no idea was forbidden, and it will not go on your permanent record. These Detainers are suspicious looking indeed."`
			`	You quickly realize they are not asking you for your opinion at all. In fact, you receive notice of the fine before they have even finished speaking. "We will need to make some modifications to the ship before you can use it. I also would strongly advise against repainting it; you will understand why later.`
