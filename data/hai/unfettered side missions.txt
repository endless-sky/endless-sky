What he says does not seem to have much sense to it - he's probably had one too many drinks, or consumed too much of whatever that weird smell comes from. When he sees you, he starts shouting.

I sold the old one and took out a loan at the bank. But when I got to the shipyard, they told me the ship I wanted was another million credits more than I thought. Now I've got plenty of credits, but not enough for a ship."`

After doing a lot of business with human pirates, I was led to believe humans all spoke this way. What a laugh they must have had thinking of me, unsuspecting the prank! But I noticed that it helps to get the business going to speak this way. It helps intimidating some, and attracting others. It shows part of a clan... So I spoke like that with you at first as well. Now it's not of any use anymore though, so I'll stop."`

As promised, it is equipped with plenty of prototype weapons and has some particulars which I am sure you will like, and includes a reinforced shield matrix. Thank you for your assistance so far!"`

Once the ship recognizes your identity, it displays the message. "This is for your eyes only. This ship is not just given to you for you to have fun shooting around. It includes a very advanced communicator, that we would not replace should you lose it. Eventually you will be able to use it to coordinate fleet actions, or even to call for reinforcements, I hope."`
