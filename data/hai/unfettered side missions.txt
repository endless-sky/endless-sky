"My associates and I have a lucrative business proposition for you. If you are interested, come find us at these coordinates." Without waiting for a response, they fold a piece of paper into your hand before quickly fading into the crowd. It lists only a location, and you cross-reference with the local maps; it appears to point towards a beach on the other side of the planet.`

You ask a Hai for directions, feeling embarrassed when you learn that all you had to do was scanning your ticket, and all relevant information would be displayed for you.`

Except for a cave, some sparse vegetation, and of course the beach itself, you cannot see anything significant in the vicinity. You double check that these are the right coordinates and look around some more.`
			`	After waiting for some time, you spot two hooded figures further down the beach making their way toward you, and you start to doubt whether or not this was a good idea. Even when they're close enough to speak, their faces somehow remain impossible to glimpse beneath the hoods. "Hello, <last>," one says to you.

The first one seems surprised by this and tries to intervene, but the second resumes before they can speak up. "These legendary weapons can interfere with nearly any enemy engine system! Worry not, you'll be able to recuperate the cost of this ship with ease by bringing medical supplies to the Unfettered. This cargo is needed on short notice, on <destination>, and we lack the time and personnel to bring them.`

In exchange, we have decided to provide you with a suitable replacement, that should hopefully allow you to exit our space safely.`

			`You see the sun slowly disappear into the horizon as you land on this planet, indicating it is already night there. Shortly after exiting your ship, you see a group of Unfettered Hai sitting on the side of the path, eating corn around a campfire. One of them, probably the youngest judging by his size, tries to get your attention by calling you repeatedly. "Captain, Captain! Can you tell me stories about how you used great cunning to beat a swarm of Lightning Bugs?" Another one, probably their parent, then speaks up. "Come, sit with us. I am sure there is much to be said about that great relic from our past."`
			`	You start to explain how the fight went, but before you can explain much, the young one interrupts you, speaking to the others, "See? There is no way they lost the ship, if they fought so well with it!" The parent speaks again, trying to console the child. "That great ship may be lost, but everything has to end at one point, and its time of glory was already behind it."`
			choice
				`	"How did you learn about the lost of the ship?"`
				`	"Nonsense, I still have the ship."`
			`	The elder of the group speaks, raising her hand to gather attention, her tone commanding respect. "That ship had an emergency locator, a relic of an age where the Hai Empire was fighting wars on different fronts, and we needed a way to find a ship if its crew had been lost in battle. It sent a short signal, meaning it was either taken apart or destroyed. Tell me, which is it?" As she says this she looks at you deep in the eye, as if she was gazing into your soul.`
			choice
				`	"It was lost in a great battle!"`
				`	"I sold the ship."`

			`	"You... what? One of the most important relics of my people, and you just sold it? At least you have the guts to own it, young human."`
			label leave
			`	She looks around, and as she does you notice more Unfettered Hai than before, talking in little groups and looking your way regularly. She gets up, and continue, in a stronger tone, "It would be wise for you to leave now, wait for things to calm down." You head back to your ship, and thankfully nobody seems be following you.`
