			`	"Oh, oh, Gemanari, this looks interesting!" The human woman looks to be in her late sixties and, when you turn to look, seems to be clucking over a holographic advertisement for a theater show. "This looks adorable, doesn't it? Oh, and it says they're using ripple ray refractive holographic flight effects!"`
			`	The advertisement does indeed look very impressive, and you pause to observe for a moment.`
			`	The Hai, presumably Gemanari, also appears to be a more mature lady who squints at it and wrinkles her nose. "Ugh, that's the Germontian interpretation though."`
			`	This receives a puzzled look to which Gemanari thinks for a second before clarifying. "You would say the Social Darwinist interpretation."`
			`	The lady grimaces and makes like she's vomiting. "I can't believe you still have those schools of thought in a society this old."`
			`	"Oh we don't really, at least not in scientific circles, but a compelling story will outlive such things. I can't stand it personally, but it is a classic." When the lady looks unimpressed, Gemanari titters and takes her gently by the arm to steer her away again. "Don't worry Alinta; I think the Misheep Wah'uden company is running my preferred interpretation on <destination> at the moment. We can see if they have any cheap tickets. Of course my aunt would insist that the hundred and eighty-third version is the only real one, but she always..."`
			`	You lose the conversation as they trail away from you, leaving you to wonder just what was so special about the hundred and eighty-third version of a play about a prehistoric flying Hai found frozen in the ice.`

At first you wonder if there's some sort of festival going on, but as you watch a young Hai wearing a hood slaps up another holo projector, creating a cartoonish root vegetable with a sword, which begins hacking at the adjacent hologram, some kind of impressionist concept of a Hai elder made up of iridescent triangles.

So to gamble money on the game is to bring real consequences to a fantasy exercise. This is taboo for an adult.`

It's just seen as very immature and base. An adult should be able to conduct their life without resorting to such primitive instincts. We learned that the hard way long ago, back before we holed up in our current borders."`

Strictly speaking, it's not necessary to go, but lots of places simply won't accept you into those sorts of roles without some sort of Academy qualification, and they really do provide some great skills.

I'm told most humans think it's backwards, but it's not. The Academies keep tabs on their graduates; if you lead with self-interest, serve without studying, study without learning or waste your knowledge without applying it, they've been known to revoke people's qualifications. Attendance is free, so there's an expectation that you don't waste what they spend time teaching you.`
