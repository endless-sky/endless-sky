			"This may sound odd, but the acorn cookies they sell here are the best cookies I've ever eaten."
			"A Hai-human fusion restaurant near here sells peanut pizza. It sounds gross, but the taste is heavenly."
			"They make beer from fermented nuts here. I didn't know you could do that!"
			"I just can't get enough acorn stew. These Hai cooks are amazing."
			"Peanut this, walnut that, hazelnut icecream. What I wouldn't give for some good steak right now..."
			"Back home, my favorite snack was pickled walnuts. Here, the pickled acorns are amazing!"
			"It's been really tough trying new foods here because almost everything conflicts with my nut allergies."
			"Where I grew up, walnuts were considered a delicacy. Now that I'm here, I eat like a king!"
			"My buddy tells me of some nearby smoothie bar that has a drink made from the extract of a 'rare green oval nut'. She said it tastes like nothing she's had back in human space, but I don't buy her story for a second."
			"If it weren't for the human settlements that decided to catch fish, I'd be stuck having to eat nuts and these really long carrot... turnip... things."

			"I met some young Hai pilots. It sounds like they start out as poor as we do."
			"I sold my entire stock of food from human space at this port. I guess even Hai get tired of nuts."
			"Some Hai were protesting the work week. They want to work only 32 hours a week instead of 40. I used to work 70 hours a week for the Syndicate!"
			"If I had known there was such high demand for human-made products around here, I would've started making trips years ago!"
			"One day I'll finally retire from my life as a merchant, and when that happens I know no better place than in Hai space."
			"Plenty of businessmen come by curious of what I have in my hold, but I'll never tell them about my stash of industrial-sized shampoo bottles that I bring in on each visit to Hai space."

			"Hai can terraform planets a hundred times faster than we can. I wonder why they didn't do that at Darkwaste?"
			"Hai have the most amazing holographic technology. One of them put on a backpack holoprojector. When he turned it on, he looked like an elephant. The legs and tail even tracked his movements! I wonder if they can mimic humans too?"
			"The Hai have an amazing grasp of quantum chromodynamics. It's why their shield generators are so effective."
			"The alloys Hai use in their ships are way beyond our technology. They're twice as strong with half the weight. No wonder their ships are so fast."
			"It's crazy to think how much human technology would improve if we knew even just a bit of what they've figured out in Hai space."
			"Such a shame that so much of the technology development to the north of Hai space is done for pointless warring. If only they put it to better use."

			"Do you see that Hai woman carrying her baby? Doesn't it look like a long-tailed teddy-bear? The Hai are so cute."
			"Do you ever wonder what the Hai would think if they saw an actual squirrel? Do they even know that squirrels exist? Are squirrels just miniature versions of the Hai? I'm so lost."
			"I always felt so rejected working as a servant on Shangri-la. Ever since I hitched a ride with a hippy who wanted to visit a 'land with giant squirrels' and ended up in Hai space, everyone around me has made me feel like I'm worth something."
			"I bet if I bought a giant squirrel costume I could make my Hai friends think I was a complete stranger. They'd probably get a kick out of that."
