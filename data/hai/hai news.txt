			"The Hai have an amazing grasp of quantum chromodynamics. It's why their shield generators are so effective."
			"The alloys Hai use in their ships are way beyond our technology. They're twice as strong with half the weight. No wonder their ships are so fast."

			"I used to rob people for a living, and I'd be in jail now if I stayed in human space. Here, they've given me a job, and I've been sober for six weeks. This has really turned my life around."
			"I lived on Freedom before I came here, and I could get space weed, death sticks, stardust, and toad juice any time of day or night. Here, the best I can find is spicy acorns."
			"I used to be a slave on a pirate ship. My fool of a captain decided to attack Hai space. The Hai freed me, and now I work in one of their factories."

			"I used to hate myself for all the terrible crimes I did in human space. Here, the Hai have given me a fresh start."
			"You have to re-invent yourself sometimes. I used to be a killer on a pirate ship, now I'm a canner in a Hai factory."
			# Duplicated intentionally so pirates say it too:
