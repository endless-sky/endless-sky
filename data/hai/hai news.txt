			"Have you tried out one of those Hai anti-missile systems? They'll waste any missile in human space."
			"Can you believe these Hai? They're light-years ahead of us, right under our noses."
			"Have you visited the Quarg ringworld here in Hai space? It's a humbling sight. There's probably more Quarg in there than there are humans anywhere. Makes you feel pretty insignificant."
			"Did you see the stuff they sell on Icelake? Hai technology is amazing."
			"I met some young Hai pilots. It sounds like they start out as poor as we do."
			"I sold my entire stock of food from human space at this port. I guess even Hai get tired of nuts."
			"Some Hai were protesting the work week. They want to work only 32 hours a week instead of 40. I used to work 70 hours a week for the Syndicate!"

			"Hai can terraform planets a hundred times faster than we can. I wonder why they didn't do that at Darkwaste?"
			"Hai have the most amazing holographic technology. One of them put on a backpack holoprojector. When he turned it on, he looked like an elephant. The legs and tail even tracked his movements! I wonder if they can mimic humans too?"
			"The Hai have an amazing grasp of quantum chromodynamics. It's why their shield generators are so effective."
			"The alloys Hai use in their ships are way beyond our technology."

			"I lived on Freedom before I came here, and I could get space weed, death sticks, stardust, and toad juice any time of day or night. Here, the best I can find is spicy acorns."
			"I used to be a slave on a pirate ship. My fool of a captain decided to attack Hai space. The Hai freed me, and now I work in one of their factories."
			"I tried smuggling some bad blue to Hai space, but they caught me right away. I don't know what scanners they use in those Hai ships, but it's a lot more effective than the Navy's toys."

			"I used to hate myself for all the terrible crimes I did in human space. Here, the Hai have given me a fresh start."
