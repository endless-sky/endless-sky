			`"Human!" The cry catches your attention not only because of the volume of the shout, but primarily because it's the most respectful term anyone has used for you in Unfettered space. You turn and see a young Hai warrior striding toward you. At least you think he's young. He's certainly thinner than most of the Hai you see south of Wah-Ki. You notice that his boots seems to be made more of mending tape than actual fabric. He's not wearing the ornately decorated knives that many of the True Hai carry, but he does have sheaths for them. Instead, he carries a long staff that looks to be made of one of the light but rigid Hai alloys. You can see that scars from many fights disturb the pattern of his fur.`
			`	"Human," he says again when he reaches you, "you should not promenade yourself in our star market without worthy guidance. This warrior can tell you what trader tongues are saying because I know your backward speech. Fast fingers not grab human things while I watch," he adds, emphasizing the point by banging the staff on the floor and making it ring. You notice the flow of traffic begins to part around you as other traders and travelers give him room.`
			`	It takes you a moment to parse what he is saying as his accent is difficult to understand. You would guess he learned your language in class but has never spoken with humans. You think he is offering to be your translator and bodyguard.`

			`	The young Unfettered proves diligent in his work. He steers you away from some vendors and towards others where the prices and quality are at least competitive. Several times his staff has flashed out and blocked people who might have bumped into you. While some of the vendors you traded with were amused by his translations, most worked through him rather than speaking to you directly. He even kept watch while you were eating, though he did seem to be distracted by the food.`
			`	At the end of the day, he follows you to the <ship> and you pay him his fee. He surprises you though, by following you on board. "I will watch over you until you make it back to the Fettered worlds. You should be safe enough on <destination>." From the prices you saw in the restaurants and shops, the amount you paid would feed him for a few days at most.`

			`	You tell him that you can take care of yourself. He nods to acknowledge your decision but maintains eye contact. He then turns and walks away.`
			`	You see him around the spaceport a few times: once working as a porter, another time loading cargo. Both seem like odd jobs for someone with his apparent skills and neither will pay very well. As you are heading back to your ship you see him at one of the small food stalls that sells really cheap noodle cups and you wonder if that's the only time he's eaten today.`
				decline
			label laugh
			`	You find yourself flat on your back looking up at the young Unfettered. He's holding your sidearm and is pointing it at you with the safety off. You later decide that he must have swept your legs with the staff and grabbed your weapon, but it happened so swiftly you never saw it.`
			`	"I was wrong," he says as he secures your weapon inside his jacket. "I mistook you for a warrior. You do not know the meaning of respect. You are but a monkey after all."`
			`	He walks off causally, never bothering to turn around.`
				decline
			label escort
			`	His eyes narrow when you tell him to leave. "Mistake to refuse generosity of True Hai," he says. You get the distinct impression that he'd take it further if he wasn't on your ship. As it is, he leaves peacefully and you close the hatch.`

			`	You drop the Hai off at the galley and tell him to eat as much as he wants while you prepare the ship for launch. When you return after reaching orbit, his belly is noticeably distended. He seems more relaxed than he did at the spaceport, but that could just be the on-coming food coma. You take him to the uniform locker and find him some boots and a jumpsuit, though you have to make some quick alterations with your knife to accommodate his tail. He asks for a sewing kit and says that he can finish the job.`

You don't see his staff; so either it's too provocative to carry in Hai space or it's collapsible and he has it somewhere on his person. He offers you comments on the Hai conversations going on around you when they are either about you or your business. While he is still stays close to you, he seems to naturally relax into the flow of Hai culture.`
			`	You lose track of him somewhere near the end of the day and he doesn't show back up at the ship. When you check his bunk, you find the <payment> you paid him on <origin> with a crudely lettered note that says, "FOR TRANSPORT."`

You check yourself quickly and you seem to be uninjured. Your clothes are in tatters, though, and your sidearm, communicator, and bag are nowhere to be seen.`
			`	You make your way back to the spaceport. For once, it's useful to be the alien. The guards are easily able to quickly clear you even without documentation. You hear them laughing as you head for the safety of your ship. You have no doubt that the story of the monkey robbed by children is already making the rounds.`
