"This is where I often come to recollect myself, because I like to be able to think alone, and nobody comes here, because they believe this is a bad sign," he says, designating an old rotten tree that looks like it used to be massive.`

It's been too long and I've grown quite worried that they may not make it here after all.`
			`	"The materials they supply us with are not urgently required, but they are needed in order to develop some of the most distant areas on this world, and maintain our current buildings."

The Syndicate would not mind a bit of smuggling, and the Navy would only take it in the unlikely event that their cover was blown and they could not escape.`
			`	"Whoever stole this cargo would not be welcome in either of those spaces, meaning that they are likely to hide away in pirate space and wait for the trail to cool down, before selling the loot back. The pirates are by far not a united faction, so they could steal loot out of one another, but given the low value of this cargo it should not have attracted much attention... I do not understand what happened. Maybe they got intercepted on the way.`

We've never found traces of those particles before. I guess it could mean a shot got through and did some damage to one of the jump drives they are carrying - maybe even the one they use to jump. One thing is certain: these particles are not left by normal human ships, or Hai for that matter. My best guess would be that when the ship jumped, the hole it left behind did not close as quickly as it should, and antimatter came from the other side. Perhaps it left these peculiar particles when being annihilated by contacting matter. Or maybe the particles just came through the opening in space?"`
			`	She shakes her head, getting focused again. "It doesn't matter much anyway, and I must be boring you with this stuff," she says with a chuckle. "I suspect that they would have gone back to their base to at least take a look at it, so there should be traces leading to it. Something bothers me about this: from our experience, jump drives either work or explode. Maybe it's because the jump drive is not actually being used, and is only leaking particles passively, that this is possible? Or maybe the damage done by these weapons is really special. After all, they are more advanced than what we have, or what the aliens up north possess. Only the Quarg and Korath have a similar level of technology, and those are the races that are rumored to have invented the jump drives, so it could be some of these weapons are intended to disrupt it specifically."`

Whatever the case, they seem surprised when they realize it belongs to you. They murmur with each other and then they start saluting, by rising one fist up. First a few do it, then more, until finally all of them are saluting in respect.`

			`	It does not seem to be the right reaction at all. They shout at you; all form of respect is gone. One very shocked Unfettered soldier even tries to shoot you for this insult! It looks like you have shown yourself to be weak to them. After some time, a warlord arrives and calms them down by rising their blade, that shines brightly enough to draw their attention.`

			`	The crowd leads you to the stadium.`
			`	The council seems surprised to see you return, especially the Unfettered warlord that annoyed you earlier, but they address you with a deeper respect than before. "You have proven yourself. Now we have almost enough jump drives for the next phase..." You look at them intensely, and after a few moments they realize, "Oh right, your payment! Here it is: <payment>! From now on, you will be referred to as Herald."`

			`	This seems to trouble them deeply. They are split between those who want to interrogate the Korath for their technological secrets, and those who still remember too freshly the horrors of the Korath raids. The Chiefs are now the most active ones - some show scars or speak of lost family, others insult the Korath. A few, however, keep their calm.`
			`	Then, finally, one of them speaks up. He had remained quiet through the argument, probably thinking. You see many scars on his arms as he stands, and can only guess at what he has been through. He speaks calmly, yet firmly, strongly enough to make everyone listen.`
			`	You recognize Choot'k. He looks different without his armor but there can be no doubt that it's him.`

When you enter the medical facility, the Korath are already speaking between themselves, and he seems surprised, stopping himself at the door. "I... I recognize that language! It brings back memories... I may not be ready to face them yet. But I'll arrange for their transport to our most advanced medical facility, I expect it will be months before they are back on their feet, and we have plans for them when they do. It would be best if you could help us then, since you are the one that rescued them." On the way out he addresses what seems to be the first Hai he sees with that task, and they get to it straight away. You then go back to the stadium.`

"Now that you officially work for us, you will receive a daily share of 1000 credits. We will not make you wear our colors yet, because it could cause problems with the Hai and those parrots that stole our worlds up north. We wish for you to be free to travel in their territory."

			`You do a detailed scan of the Alpha base to see if there are any more jump drives, or anyone who could have witnessed the fight. You cannot retrieve any information: it seems to either be too deep or shielded from scans in some way. You will have to go in blind.`
			`	Surprisingly, the doors of the hangar open to let you in. Maybe it is an automated response to this ship, or whoever is down here assumed the Alphas won the fight. That said, if there is anyone here, it's probably a skeleton crew.`
			`	You and your crew carefully exit your ship, but you see no signs of life here. They could be hidden, so you proceed cautiously, looking for the jump drive vault. On the way you hear sounds - sounds that definitely did not originate from humans. Heading that way, you find a brig full of prisoners, with a lizard head displayed above the cells. They seem to have been mistreated by the Alphas, and you find what appears to be a crudely rigged translation device next to their cell, with information regarding these Korath, an alien species located north-east of human space that sometimes engages in raiding. They apparently used to control the territories nearby that are now owned by automata.`
			`	The captives themselves must have endured a lot, so you should take them to Darkcloak and ask the Chiefs for help. You notice one of them has a very serious injury to his leg, and it seems that it has been partially replaced by a crude prosthetic. He may not survive the transport.`
			`	You find the jump drives easily enough, close to the hangar. There are ten here, and you load them all onto your ship. It seems the base was abandoned for some reason, but you can find no bodies or signs of an attack. Deciding to not overstay your welcome, you head back to the Auxiliary.`
			choice

			`	As you explore the Auxiliary, you find out more about their flight patterns. It seems the Alphas had big plans for these prisoners, as you see the lizard head symbol from earlier on many log entries, but the details are so well-encrypted that there is no hope learning more any time soon. You do find their captain's most recent log: apparently, they had indeed been waiting here to ambush you on arrival. You must have really scared them by scanning them in the Unfettered system to warrant such extreme response... Or maybe it's more than that.`
			choice
				`	(Look for reports of the leak.)`
				`	(Better not dig too deep.)`
					goto warning
			`	You find out the particles were created deliberately as a lure to draw you into the ambush here. Indeed the instructions to lay those weird traces were explained to these mercenaries in detail. Thankfully, you were tougher than they anticipated and secured victory for yourself. Did the Unfettered know about this, or did Mera really think it was a jump drive malfunction?`
			`	You find a few squirrel symbols, and a fist that could indicate they were coerced. The Alphas seem to often communicate using simple symbols for their logs as a primitive code, on top of the more serious encryptions used for sensitive information. Going deeper into these recent logs of activities, you find a monkey symbol, with an eye next to it. But it is not all, there is a symbol of a crossed portal, with a red skull icon.`
			`	There are also multiple flight logs. It seems they had been using this Auxiliary as a mobile base and for bringing jump drives to the Unfettered. These logs probably contain indications of where they have been getting the jump drives, but analyzing all of them will take more time. It doesn't take much, though, to notice they have spent significant time near Korath Exile territory. It is now time to leave the planet and go see the Chiefs.`
			label warning
			`	Before leaving, you remember that the Unfettered want you to show them the Auxiliary, and they probably expect you to land with it as flagship. Make sure you bring all ten jump drives back in your cargo or on the flagship, and that you keep this ship alive at all cost. It may be wise to wait a bit and replenish your fuel in this system.`
