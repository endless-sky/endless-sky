When you pressed her for answers she said, "It'll be obvious soon. We Hai choose our elders for their indecisiveness and slothfulness." Hopefully now you'll learn the meaning of those words.`
			
			`	Soon after landing, you're brought to a Hai government building in the capital city through a series of shuttles and trains. As you pass through the building, you notice its architecture is far different and more varied than you've seen anywhere else in Hai space.`
			`	"Much of this was designed before the Stagnation," Teeneep tells you, "back when your hairy ancestors were climbing jungle trees to eat fruit. Our people were less frivolous and more inventive back then. This building has been moved several times as our capital changed, but every time it is rebuilt as the original."`

			`	Soon you are in a grand meeting hall, designed for a council of over a hundred elders. The hall is empty except for Teeneep, three elders, two guards, and yourself.`

More as a painful thorn in their side that won't come out. It seems workers rights activists are as popular on Hai-Home as they are on Syndicate planets.`
			`	Teeneep thanks the Elders for meeting with her, and calmly explains the problem. The Elders listen intently; it is clear they're deeply concerned.`
			choice
				`	(Continue.)`
			
			
			`	The first Elder speaks, "We will happily pay whatever the slavers demand for our people, but it sounds like money won't return all the Hai. Please tell them we agree to the 19 million, and try to negotiate for more slaves."`
			`	The second Elder adds, "Our agreement with the human Republic is very clear: Hai do not enter human space without permission from the topmost levels of both governments. The risk of instability to both countries is too great if we are discovered prematurely.`
			`	"We know the locations of all Hai in human space with permission to be there, and none are on Stormhold. The 900 enslaved Hai must have entered human space without permission, against the laws of both countries. We realize this is a common occurrence, and there are consequences for disobedience."`

			`	The third Elder says, "Regardless of what laws were broken, slavery is too terrible a punishment. If they cannot be rescued through peace, then a military strike may be the only way."`
			`	The first Elder responds, "Sending military ships through the wormhole is strictly forbidden both by ancient laws, and by our agreement with the humans. There may be serious consequences to that course of action. This decision cannot be made lightly."`
			
			
			`	The second Elder concludes the discussion, "We three cannot give such drastic orders. The full Elder Council must decide. They will meet in a few weeks and this will be the first item on the agenda."`
			`	Before Teeneep can respond, the Elders turn around and leave.`

Admiral Cain you know as the head of the Republic Navy forces that patrol nearest the wormhole. Captain Wallace wears the Parliamentary Medal of Valor, which is given only to one officer per year.`
			
			choice
				`	(Continue.)`
			`	After Teeneep's lengthily explanation, Admiral Cain is the first to respond, "Enslavement through kidnapping is common occurrence on the edge of human space. Most of the crew on a pirate ship are slaves; teenagers or young adults forced into service. Many slaves are smuggled past the Navy to the Paradise Worlds or Syndicate to act as personal slaves or laborers in dangerous environments. Unfortunately, rescue is nearly impossible.`
			
			`	"Human pirates will do anything to avoid capture, including using their own slaves as shields. During any capture attempt, 50-80% of the slaves die. The Navy loses three soldiers for every one slave freed. Against a well-defended facility like you describe, it may be five to one or more. Long-term, even WE cannot sustain those losses.`
			`	"The Republic has a far more effective way of combating slavery."`
			choice
				`	(Continue.)`
			`	Captain Wallace is visibly angry and almost growling. A stern look from Admiral Cain quickly calms him down.`
			
			`	The Admiral continues, "The Navy has a strict policy on slaves in pirate custody: do not rescue. If we see a disabled pirate ship, we don't offer surrender. We shoot the ship, killing every teenage slave soldier onboard. If we detect a ship smuggling slaves, even women and children, we don't attempt an arrest. We destroy the ship. If they free themselves, and come to us for sanctuary, we'll accept them. That's the only condition in which we rescue.`
			`	"The Navy's policy is harsh, even inhumane, but it is the only effective way we've found to reduce slavery. Captains are afraid to become slavers because it is a death sentence, no matter the cost. Slave owners know they'll lose their investment as soon as it is discovered. Captured humans are willing to fight to the death to avoid slavery since they know they'll probably die when the pirates are caught.`
			
			`	"I wish there was another way, but there isn't." You can see by his expression that his words are sincere.`
			
			choice
				`	(Continue.)`
			`	Teeneep's face is filled with confusion that quickly changes to utter horror. "They're your own people. Vulnerable, tortured, victims. You kill them by the thousands?"`
			`	"Millions," Captain Wallace corrects her, getting visibly angry again. "Estimates are between 900,000 and 1,300,000 per year. Of those, at least 40,000 are younger than the age of seven and at least 20,000 are pregnant women."`
			
			`	Agent Kopkow interjects, "Yes, but those numbers have steadily decreased. Fifty years ago, there were twenty times as many slaves in human space. Our methods may be brutal, but they are effective. Later generations will look at us as villains, but they will be grateful for the freedom we won them."`
			
			choice
				`	(Continue.)`
			`	Captain Wallace asks, "These are enslaved Hai. Surely we can make an exception, in the name of galactic peace?" From his voice, it sounds like that was a rhetorical question.`
			
			`	Agent Kopkow rolls his eyes, "As the captain knows full well, tens of thousands of your people sneak into human space every year, in violation of our countries' agreement. An estimated 17% of them die within a year and 33% within five years. About 9% join the pirates willingly, not as slaves. These are all risk-takers who suffer from their shortsightedness. Parliament won't accept a large sacrifice of Navy lives to save a group of alien criminals."`
			
			`	Teeneep ears perk up as she hears her family's vacation referred to as, "shortsighted risk-taking by alien criminals."`
			`	Before she can correct the agent, Captain Wallace interrupts, "What about the possible Syndicate involvement?"`
			
			choice
				`	(Continue.)`
			`	Agent Kopkow says, "That does concern me. Aliens with advanced technology in the hands of Syndicate extremists?"`
			`	Admiral Cain nods in agreement, "I'll ask Navy Intelligence to confirm your story. We'll send agents and reconnaissance drones. If they prove your words true, I'm sure I can convince my superiors to take the base intact. We'll have to interrogate the surviving slaves, and press charges against any collaborators. I'm sure the vast majority will be allowed to return home."`
			`	"I think I can promise Parliament's support for that, and Republic Intelligence as well. We should have some answers in a month or two."`
			
			`	"Then it's agreed. Captain, you can see the lady out."`
			choice
				`	(Continue.)`
			`	The captain walks you all the way to your ship telling stories of Navy brutality and heroism towards slaves. Apparently there is a lot of dissension in the ranks about that and other questionable Navy orders.`
