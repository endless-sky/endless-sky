Often this contains useful tidbits, such as which merchants are ticked off at the moment and whether you should expect to wait a while for refueling. Today, though, you overhear a captain telling an acquaintance a remarkable tale.`
			`	Apparently, there is a man-beast on <planet>, and when the other captain laughs at the idea of a modern "werewolf," the first one is quick to clarify that it's more like a meter and a half tall "were-squirrel." There seems to be some confused discussion about the mythology of such beasts being revealed when caught staring at bright lights until a third captain, listening in the same as you, butts in to inform them that one of them stole that from a popular show a few years back.`
			`	You stop listening on your final approach as the conversation descends into a good-natured argument. Nevertheless, it sounds like a lead on a possible stranded Hai that would be worth following up.`

An occasional tour of duty with the military, a thrill-seeking adventure with the hopes of getting a reaction upon returning, or even... defection to our brethren. If the authorities tried to track down every single Hai who went missing as soon as they went missing, they'd spend their time chasing their tails fruitlessly.`
			`	"Doubtlessly I'm on a register somewhere, with a timer counting down. It is even possible that someone has been told to watch for if I show up on Darkcloak.

			`	The whole family cheers and it turns out they were already packed to leave. Duniip explains they move regularly so they're not found. It takes them under two minutes to finish preparations and don their holoprojectors. Your walk back to the ship is largely uneventful until some men with strange scanners detect the Yeertle family. One man throws a small grenade with a green light on top. You recognize it as a low-level EMP device. All five holograms turn off, along with a nearby bank of lights, but by the time you stumble to a stop and identify the cause you're much closer to your ship than they are to you.`

Looking back, you see the men were not following you; they were running to their own ships. Looks like they're planning to follow you into orbit.`

			`As you walk through a major street, you notice a woman approach an alcove in the side of a building carrying some food. She looks around to see if she's being followed before entering the alcove and covering it with a sheet of steel. You only had a moment to observe, but through the gap you spotted something hiding inside the small alcove which might have had tufts of hair sticking out of the clothing across its body. It's probably a Hai.`
			`	Do you want to investigate?`

				`	(Investigate.)`
				`	(Come back later.)`

			`	You knock on the steel sheet, and a woman within the alcove slides it to the side. As she emerges, she carefully moves her body to block your view of the alcove.`

			`	Her expression immediately takes on a shade of panic and you hear what sounds like something heavy being picked up in the background. "Please don't tell anyone! We were both kidnapped, but we managed to escape. Now we're hiding here, hoping those people don't find us again."`

					goto "come in"
				`	"No really, you can trust me, I promise!"`
			`	Lucy's face goes pale and she seems frozen in shock, while in the background you can hear sounds of someone who is definitely rushing to do something, though you can't see what.`
			choice
				`	"No wait! Luf e ow, vai, luf e eh?"`
			label "come in"
			`	The person in the background stills. "What did you say?"`
			`	You repeat the phrase.`
			`	Somewhere out of sight you hear a string of Hai words that sound very exasperated before they address Lucy again. "Let them in, Lucy, they probably are here to help."`
			`	The emphasis placed on the "are" is thick, and it seems to snap Lucy out of her frozen state. "Oh, uh, yes, alright. If you could fly us to <planet>, we can pay you when we arrive. You'll likely be followed though, so I hope you have a fast ship. I think you should probably come in, and we'll talk about it."`
			choice
				`	(Enter their alcove.)`
				`	"No, I can't help you get home."`
					decline
			`	The alcove is a dead air space between two utility rooms in the basement of a warehouse. The hole in the wall looks like it was recently dug out by a laser cutter. There's a small refrigerator, a two-person cot, an air processor, and a shelf with typical household items. Books are strewn everywhere; the women must be avid readers. It seems they've set up this tiny space as a decent, albeit very small, apartment.`
			`	The human woman slides the sheet of steel back into place behind you both once you're in and says, "I'm Lucy."`
			`	"And I'm Meroot," adds the Hai woman. "I was on Newhome walking to my research lab when some men pulled me into an alley and zapped me with a taser. I woke up in the brig of a spaceship."`
			`	"My experience was similar. I was walking from my biolab to my house on Serpens. Some men jumped out from behind a dune and zapped me."`
			`	Meroot continues, "They took us both here. I was able to struggle out of my handcuffs and sneak the keys from the guard. We escaped together, and we've been hiding for weeks. Please take us to <destination>!"`
			choice
				`	"Sure. Let's go."`
				`	"No, you'll have to find another pilot."`
					decline
			`	The two women put on clothing that thoroughly covers their persons. They lead you through a series of ducts and alleys back to the pad where your ship is parked. Just as your airlock opens there's a sharp zapping sound as someone shoots Meroot with a stun gun. You and Lucy duck, and a couple other shots dissipate harmlessly on the bulkhead of your ship. You fire off a couple shots back and, between the two of you, manage to drag Meroot through the airlock, seal it behind you, and lift off. It appears you're being followed into orbit.`

At first glance it appears to be the sort of crate that is well-insulated against sound and temperature, but this one must have concealed breathing holes. You can still hear muffled thumping fairly clearly, but outside you hear what sounds like a loading vehicle pull up, and you don't know what's in the crate.`
