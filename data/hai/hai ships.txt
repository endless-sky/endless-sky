Because of how peaceful Hai space has been for much of its history, Aphids only come with basic defenses as stock, and rely on larger Hai ships for more serious protection."

	description `The introduction of humans to the Hai civilization has led to a substantial amount of cultural exchange. While some may argue that pickled acorns have been the greatest product of this relationship, many more will point to this luxury transport ship. The product of human-Hai cooperation from the project's inception, the Centipede was released around the turn of the 31st century, but has already become quite popular among Hai fleets.`

	description `A design nearly as old as the Aphid, practically no new Cicadas have been built in recent memory; it is so reliable that the second-hand market is saturated Cicadas that have outlived not just one pilot, but in many cases multiple whole lineages of Hai that have owned one and passed it down through the generations. This feature is likely the main factor which has kept the popularity of the Scarab in check as well as defining the Yeer e Ki shipyard's motto: "Service for Life".`

	description "The Hai upgraded their original Pond Strider after acquiring hull repair technology through alien diplomacy. These improvements have greatly reduced casualties in their conflict with the Unfettered, since the light Pond Striders become vulnerable as they collect damaged drones. Besides enabling the ship to repair damaged drones, the Hai have cleverly innovated the Railgun to make the Pond Strider and Fleas into very efficient combat support for their fleets."

	description "The Sea Scorpion was designed several decades ago to serve as a mobile platform to launch Trackers. However, it is only recently that the Unfettered have been able to mass produce them. While individually vulnerable, the reduced cost of manufacturing compared to Shield Beetles allow the materially inferior Unfettered to gain a numerical advantage against their brethren."

	description `The hard-working cousin to the Lightning Bug, the Scarab has only ever grown in popularity, never declined. That this statistic is occasionally measured in thousandths of a percentage point for years at a time is immaterial to the title. This lightweight transport is commonly the pick for Grasshopper pilots looking to make money while continuing to feed their free spirit. It is also large enough to transport a large Hai family, making it perfect for nearly any odd job in Hai space.`

	description "Before the Shield Beetle, the Hai used the Titan Beetle, a weaker but more capable ship of a similar design. The Emperor Beetle is a Titan coated with many layers of modern armor, making it a more powerful warship than anything else the Hai have built in modern times. Unfortunately, the advanced features are quite expensive, so these ships are used sparingly as flagships and trophy ships."
	description "	As it is not meant to plunder but to lead in glorious battle, many of the cargo bays were removed and converted to space for weapons and defensive improvements. This change came at the cost of increased mass and lowered agility, but that is a sacrifice the Unfettered are more than willing to make."
	description "	More than just a ship, the Emperor Beetle was built to inspire fear in its enemies, making it known that they face no simple Hai, but the military leaders of the Unfettered leading at the front of those they command. Some believe it to be foolish to show their leaders' ships in such a manner, but that is not how the Unfettered think. This ship was built to withstand far more punishment than any normal Shield Beetle, while still being able to dish out damage of its own."

	description "The design of the Water Bug is almost as old as the Aphid, but until recently it never saw much use. A spike in aggression from the Unfettered Hai has led the tougher and more well-defended Water Bug to see an increase in popularity over its little brother, the Aphid. The Water Bug is now the most widely used Hai freighter, comprising the bulk of all Hai merchant fleets."
