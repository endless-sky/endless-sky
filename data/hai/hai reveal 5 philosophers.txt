My part of Internal Affairs works on piracy-related matters.`
			`	"I know what your people are going through," he says. "When I was a teenager, pirates kidnapped my brother and father, and forced them to serve on pirate vessels, calling them 'indentured servants.' My father watched helplessly as my brother's disabled ship was destroyed by a Navy Frigate just as it exited hyperspace. He eventually escaped - but he's now serving his seventeenth year of a twenty-five-year sentence for piracy, even though his deeds were against his will," Moray explains as he leads you into a large building.`
			`	"You see, the hails of the Navy: loyalty, honor, bravery - half-truths at best. We see the Navy as heroes because they are the only large organization capable of self-sacrifice. Yes, they do many good deeds, but those deeds blind us to their brutality and immorality. Not all humans are like that - many members of the Navy disagree with the barbaric rules about slavery. Some of us in the Syndicate, Free Worlds, and elsewhere, are trying to solve this problem."`

			`	"I have some leads on the organization behind this. There is a pirate gang with an extensive array of contacts in organized crime both up in the Far North and closer to home within the Syndicate - possibly even Syndicate executives. I can say for sure though that they're definitely doing this without the permission of the Syndicate proper. I swear to you that I will do everything in my power to track down whoever is responsible for this reprehensible act. They will be brought to justice.`
			`	"I know there are two holding facilities in human space where the kidnapped researchers are brought for processing before passing through the wormhole at Devil-Run. They're on the pirate planets of Stormhold and Deadman's Cove, but I don't know the exact locations yet. Please, leave at once to talk to humanity's government. Perhaps you can stall this conflict long enough for us to get some answers."`

Many of our people have been kidnapped over the past few decades, and some still reside beyond the wormhole at Devil-Run. Worst of all, your authorities have killed numerous Hai on slaver ships, without attempting rescue or even offering the opportunity to surrender. We demand the return of our people and an immediate end to the killing of slaves."`
			`	The President is the first to respond. "The problem of piracy in human space is a difficult one and cannot be solved overnight. The pirates are well-entrenched in their planets, and fighting them is a long and brutal struggle. With our navies distracted fighting one another, our recent war has left them stronger than ever."`
			`	The Chancellor continues, "The Free Worlds has made great strides reducing piracy by befriending the peoples of the anarchist worlds. We're discussing similar approaches with the Republic. Perhaps in another few years, piracy will be entirely eliminated."`
			`	"We have a counter-proposal," the President says. "The Free Worlds and Republic will establish a customs service on Mountaintop. Hai visiting human space will check in with us there. Our intelligence agencies will then track their movements in order to see to their safety as best we can. They'll also be given contacts on every human planet that they can go to for help. In the meantime, we will place extensive surveillance fleets at Ultima Thule to detect any unapproved Hai travel. We will do our best to disable and capture ships with kidnapped Hai, no matter the risk to Navy lives."`

"Actually, there was something I wanted to make sure I explained before we meet the Unfettered leadership: I'm carrying real weapons for a reason. This meeting will probably seem violent, and that will probably make you think the Unfettered are a barbaric people. They're not; they 'play up' their violent nature. It's a hard concept to explain - we have Hai words for this that don't translate well into your language. That's the simplest way I can think to explain it without spending twenty minutes here, so it'll have to suffice."`
			`	She glances around. "Besides, we're already close to running late. Let's get going."`
			`	You pass through a hallway filled with battle trophies and enter a large room filled with uniformed Hai. You notice many of them have swords similar to Teeneep's, though they look more ceremonial than functional.`
			`	As Teeneep walks in, an Unfettered moves to block her path. From the extensive decorations on his uniform, it appears he's a high-ranking officer. "You're not welcome here, False Hai." He starts to push her away. In one motion, Teeneep spins around, unsheathes a sword, and swipes it across his arm, drawing blood. The Hai grunts, surprised, and steps aside to let Teeneep pass.

			label watch
			`	Teeneep explains to the leader, "Twenty thousand Hai have been enslaved by human pirates. They're concealed in a subterranean base that can only be reached with both a Jump Drive and a Quantum Keystone. Dozens of human capital ships and thousands of human pirates guard the Hai. We haven't enough Jump Drives to rescue them.`
			# Note: Teeneep is using hyperbole; she knows most of the 20,000 Hai at Philosopher's Paradise were probably born there.
			`	"You were once the protectors of all Hai. I ask you be so again. Free our people from slavery and kill their human slavers."`
			`	The Unfettered leader responds, "Your people have outlawed and abandoned us. You give us insulting food donations with propaganda on them. You block our ships from returning to Hai-home. Why should we help you, a race of slothful cowards? Your people are an insult to all Hai."`
			`	Teeneep suddenly takes three strides forward, closing the distance between her and the Unfettered leader in less than a second. You had forgotten how quick Hai are; few humans could do what she just did. "I challenge you for rule of the Unfettered military!"`
			`	"You haven't the authority to do that," he responds, laughing.`
			`	Teeneep draws a throwing knife and launches it. It zips through the air, passing within a hand's width of the Unfettered leader before embedding itself in the wall behind. "Fight me! Are you afraid to fight a woman half your size? Fight me, coward!" From her expression, you're unsure if she genuinely has that much faith in her abilities, or if this is a bluff.`
			`	The Unfettered leader pauses, then smiles. "There is no need. Even on our planets, I've rarely met a Hai half as brave as you. You are a True Hai, and we protect our own. You have vouched for the value of the lives of these Hai, so we will send a fleet to rescue them. I will lead the attack myself."`

We cannot spare a large fleet though, so I will need your people to upgrade ten Shield Beetles to our specifications. We'll return your outfits after the battle." He motions to another officer, who hands him a data card. "These are the instructions."`

			`General Choot'k cuts open the doors of a large hangar, and your ships land. The two hundred operatives pour out, wearing exoskeletons with built-in shields. As they storm through the complex, you follow some of them. Their guns melt away meter-thick walls in seconds, and they have have gas bombs which can knock people out for hours. The pirates outnumber the Republic operatives two dozen to one, but this huge advantage in equipment, combined with training, gives the operatives a fighting chance.`
			`	The squads move room to room, neutralizing all opposition with ease until their opponents switch tactics. The pirates begin using electromagnetic pulse devices to shut down the suits (and all other electronics nearby), leaving the operatives helpless for about ten seconds.`
			`	After a bloody struggle, forty-three surviving operatives win the fight, clearing the way to a large blast door. The vast door is twelve meters high and wide, and scanners show it to be six meters deep. The operatives focus all of their suits' firepower on one part of the door, eventually burning a hole through it. They pass through into the darkness of the next room.`
			choice
				`	(Follow them.)`
			`	Scanners show the room to be a vast cavern, some sort of meeting room suitable for ten thousand people or more. It's pitch black when you enter. Once all operatives are inside, a second blast door closes behind you, and lights turn on making the room as bright as day.`
			`	You see before you a couple hundred pirates, held captive by a large crowd of heavily-armed civilians - all of which are now hesitantly pointing guns at the operatives. It seems the citizens have arranged a violent rebellion to coincide with the Republic's attack. Three unarmed civilians walk towards the operatives: one Hai, one human, and one Korath. The leader of the Republic operatives exits her suit and approaches them.`
			`	The Hai speaks. "We are the leaders of the civilian government of Philosopher's Paradise. Although we are grateful for your assistance in defeating our violent rulers, we will not accept your dominion either. We have heard of your war with the Free Worlds. Philosopher's Paradise is an independent nation; we will never join the Republic. I can, however, promise our country will turn to peace, and we will send no military ships through the wormhole."`
			`	After several hours of discussion, the operatives leave their suits, preparing to return peacefully to Republic space.`

			label korath
			`	The Korath leader begins speak, with the Hai translating. "Several generations ago, three of our raiding ships jumped into the Alcyone system. Numerous pirate vessels left Stormhold and disabled all of our ships. A large human ship boarded our flagship while us on the other two vessels listened over communicators. All we heard was screaming. The pirates used deadly gas - what you call 'nerve gas' - to kill the entire crew.  The death is excruciatingly painful to Korath. Not wanting that fate, most of the raiders on the second and third Korath ships mutinied and then surrendered. We worked as slaves for the pirate gangs, but now we're here, safe, and free. We are not scientists like the others here, but we help as we can.`
			`	"The pirates must defend this planet against a space-based lifeform that attacks in flocks. Our ships gave them a significant advantage. Fortunately, we have one more left defend against any threats." The Korath eyes the Republic operatives as he waits for the translator to catch up.`
			`	"I must ask you keep the presence of Korath here a secret. If the Archons or other Exiles hear of this place, they may attack to retrieve us, or the Exiles may simply pillage. We will remain here in hiding unless the Exiles finally learn to settle on their planet."`
				goto questions
			label "translation services"
			`	The Korath leader hisses and replies while the Hai translates. "No, we cannot. Few among the Korath know your language, and we must remain here in secret. Perhaps in time there will be a way, but not yet."`
				goto questions
			label "microtransceivers"
			`	The Korath leader looks to the Hai, who responds, "Is that how you were led back here?"`
			`	"Yes," you reply.`
			`	The Hai leader continues, "Excellent! That was the plan. Our overlords ordered us to create a means of tracking their prey. The microtransceivers were a combination of Hai medical microbots and what our Korath friends here could tell us. None of the surviving Korath were scientists, but many of them seemed to have an uncanny knack for engineering. With their help, we augmented the transceivers to transmit in hyperspace as well, hoping it would lead someone back here."`
			`	The human leader adds, "I can scarcely believe it worked, but I'm very glad it did."`
				goto questions
			label home
			`	The three leaders laugh. The Hai answers, "We are home. This is a place of learning, where three races join as one to seek knowledge. Some recent kidnapping victims wish to leave. We will help you find them and send them home."`
			`	The Korath speaks next, and the Hai translates. "Where my people came from, everyone was starving, barely subsisting. We had to raid for supplies, or slave away in bleak factory stations. This is a much better place for us."`
			`	The human leader concludes, "Most of the humans in this city have been here for several generations. This has always been home to us."`
				goto questions
			label place
			`	"We understand you have heard some of the story from your spy," the human replies, "but I am happy to fill in the details. This place was founded over a hundred twenty years ago by anarchists from the colony of Freedom. With the Syndicate on their doorstep, some of them evolved into anarcho-syndicalists and attempted to bring it down from within. To do this, they allied with less peaceful anarchists and pirates. Those less savory types kidnapped researchers and engineers, forcing them to devise new weapons or medicines, and who eventually inherited control here after the syndicalists were wiped out. Our city also has manufacturing facilities where we created goods the pirates could not easily build in human space, where their facilities are destroyed regularly.`
			`	"There have been various attempts to take the city by force or by money. Early on, there were attempts by Alpha groups, and then various illegal organizations who tracked this place down from rumors about their rivals. There was even someone from the Syndicate who came with his personal fleet, though none of them returned home from that attempt. Some used chemical or biological weapons, others sent ships. Many offered money or favors. Philosopher's Paradise has always been an independent country, and always will be.`
			`	"Now that the pirates are gone, us civilians may rule without fear, and for that you have our gratitude. As the upper region of the city has already been destroyed, we have little to fear from attack by space creatures in the short-term, and soon we'll have our shipyards at full capacity such that we may defend ourselves.`
			`	"We won't ever join the Republic or any other government beyond the wormhole, but you personally will always be welcome, along with those you trust, for what you have done today. Our research and manufacturing facilities are damaged now, but as they are repaired, we will make them available to you."`
				goto questions
			label do
			`	"We're scientists, engineers, philosophers, people of learning. There are laboratories throughout this city where people from all three races work together. We seek knowledge. Under the pirates, we were allowed this freedom, as they realized it was the most effective way to get results from scientists. Now that our abusive masters are gone, our research will take peaceful routes."`
			`	"Of course, this is also a city. People have lived here for several generations, multiplying fruitfully. We have had to carve out more and more of the moon. There is plenty of space left before our growth will have to stop."`
				goto questions
			label space
			`	"Very little. The pirates wouldn't let us leave the planet, and jump drives are precious to them. They cannot risk drives on science expeditions. Still, we have managed a few trips."`
			`	"There is no evidence that any civilization has ever reached this region of space until us. There are many space-faring indigenous creatures that live in gas giants, and sometimes venture beyond. Most are harmless, so long as you leave them alone. There are flocking apex predators who hunt anything that moves.`
			`	"The planet below is a mystery to us. It has a thousand times the mass it realistically should, and its gravitational field reads as such from a great distance. This tremendous gravitational field sustains the large asteroid belt. Despite its incredible mass, as you approach the surface, the field does not increase at anywhere near the rate that it should. Thus, when you stand upon it, the gravity is only similar to that of Earth. There are many forms of radiation and strange materials inside the planet's caves. Perhaps, now that we are not developing pirate weapons, we can focus on exploration."`

			label leave
			`	As you return to your ship, Teeneep interrupts you. "I need you to escort me one last time, Captain <last>. I must return to <destination> to resolve things now that the threat is ended. You will be well-paid, of course."`
			`	Anticipating your next question, she says, "The ships of the Unfettered Hai will be escorted back with us since the Philosophers are convinced they are at no risk and still have a ship at their disposal. Some of them have chosen to remain here and join the philosophers. More than enough bunks have subsequently been freed to return those who have chosen to come home with us. The surviving operatives are planning how to return to Foundry themselves."`
			`	Teeneep follows you back to your ship as you prepare to leave the Philosopher's Paradise.`
