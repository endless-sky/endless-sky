There's been a big outpouring of support, and a lot of anger at the Elders for letting this go on for so long."`

My part of Internal Affairs works on piracy-related matters."`

"When I was a teenager, pirates kidnapped my brother and father, and forced them to serve on pirate vessels, calling them 'indentured servants.' My father watched helplessly as my brother's disabled ship was destroyed by a Navy Frigate just as it exited hyperspace. My father eventually escaped. He is serving his seventeenth year of a twenty-five-year sentence for piracy, even though his deeds were against his will"`

			`	"I have some leads on the organization behind this. There is a pirate gang with an extensive array of contacts with organized crime both up in the Far North and closer to home within the Syndicate; possibly even Syndicate executives. I can say for sure though that they're definitely doing this without the permission of the Syndicate proper. I swear to you, I will do everything in my power to track down whoever is responsible for this reprehensible act. They will be brought to justice."`

Many of our people have been kidnapped over the past few decades, and some still reside beyond the wormhole at Devil-Run. Worst of all, your authorities have killed numerous Hai on slaver ships, without attempting rescue or even offering surrender. We demand the return of our people and the immediate cease of the killing of slaves."`
			`	The President is the first to respond, "The problem of piracy in human space is a difficult one and cannot be solved overnight. The pirates are well-entrenched in their planets, and fighting them is a long and brutal struggle. The war left them stronger than ever with our navies distracted fighting one another."`
			`	The Chancellor continues, "The Free Worlds has made great strides reducing piracy by befriending the peoples of the anarchist worlds. We're discussing similar approaches with the Republic. Perhaps in another few years, piracy will be entirely eliminated."`
			`	The President says, "We have a counter-proposal. The Free Worlds and Republic will establish a customs service on Mountaintop. Hai visiting human space will check in with us. Our intelligence agencies will track their movements and see to their safety as best we can; they'll be given contacts on every planet to go to for help. In the meantime, we will place extensive surveillance fleets at Ultima Thule to detect any unapproved Hai travel. We will do our best to disable and capture ships with kidnapped Hai, no matter the risk of Navy lives."`

Alas, the Quarg have not such technology, nor do the Korath." He smiles, "But the Quarg speak to the Drak."

With this, the anarchists explored much more of the galaxy and eventually found this moon."`

			`You meet Teeneep outside her Centipede and you're surprised to see her with no bodyguards. Instead of her Hai Elder robes, she's wearing what looks like a fencing outfit. There are two swords on her back and several balanced knives on her belt. She's wearing a headband with a medallion on it that looks like an athletic medal.`
			`	She pays you for the trip and says, "These blades are not ceremonial. Leave your gun behind or the Unfettered may think you're an assassin. I'll protect you."`
			`	You hand your gun to a nearby Unfettered, and hope Teeneep is as capable as she claims.`
			`	Now that you see her in this guise, you remember a fencing match advertisement. She looks exactly like the fencing champion a few years ago. Is Teeneep a champion fencer as well as a civil rights leader and Hai Elder? From appearances, she hasn't been in adulthood for long. Though with such celebrity power, it's no surprise she rose in society quickly.`

			`	"To Unfettered Hai leadership, this meeting is all a political ploy. They know it's in their best interest to help us. It will raise public opinion towards them among the Fettered and likely lure more recruits to their side. They cannot be seen as helping a weak coward though. I have to prove myself in front of the troops."`
			`	"Why else do you think the Hai Elders would pick the one fencing champion among their number for this trip?"`
			label follow
			`	You pass through a hallway filled with battle trophies and enter a large room filled with uniformed Hai. You notice many of them have swords similar to Teeneep's. Their swords look more ceremonial than functional though.`
			`	As Teeneep walks in, an Unfettered moves to block her path. From the extensive decorations on his uniform, it appears he's a high-ranking officer. "You're not welcome here, False Hai." He starts to push her away with his hand, and you notice it's on a very personal part of her body.`
			`	In one motion, Teeneep spins around, unsheathes a sword, and cuts the man's arm off at the shoulder. While he's writhing in agony, she cleans her sword on his head, and then re-sheathes it. Teeneep is coated in the man's blood. She walks towards the gigantic leader of the Unfettered, whose face betrays his surprise and admiration.`

				`	(Walk in and join Teeneep.)`
				`	(Stand in the room's entrance and watch.)`
					goto watch
			`	As you enter the room, a pair of Unfettered grab you and pin you to the wall. Teeneep pulls out a throwing knife and says, "Let him go now." The Unfettered let go immediately and she puts her knife away. As you walk towards her, she signals for you to stay where you are.`
			label watch
			`	Teeneep explains to the leader, "Twenty thousand Hai have been enslaved by human pirates. They're concealed in a subterranean base that can only be reached with a Jump Drive and a Quantum Keystone. Dozens of human capital ships and thousands of human pirates guard the Hai. We haven't enough Jump Drives to rescue them."`
			# Note: Teeneep is using hyperbole; she knows most of the 20,000 Hai at Philosopher's Paradise were probably born there.
			`	"You were once the protectors of all Hai. I ask you be so again. Free our people from slavery, and kill their human slavers."`
			`	The Unfettered leader responds, "Your people have outlawed and abandoned us. You give us insulting food donations with propaganda on them. You block our ships from returning to Hai-home. Why should we help you? A race of slothful cowards? Your people are an insult to all Hai." He turns to walk away.`
			`	Teeneep dives beneath the man's legs and jumps on a nearby table in front of him. You had forgotten how quick Hai are; few humans could do what she did. She unsheathes both swords and says, "I challenge you for rule of the Unfettered military!"`
			`	"You haven't the authority to do that," he responds, laughing.`
			`	She jumps down and puts both swords at his throat. "Fight me! Are you afraid to fight a woman half your size? Fight me, coward!" From her expression, you're sure if she genuinely has that much faith in her abilities, or if this is a bluff.`
			`	"There is no need," he smiles. "Even on our planets, I've never met a woman half as brave as you. You are a True Hai and we protect our own. You have vouched for the value of the lives of these Hai, so we will send a fleet to rescue them. I will lead the attack myself."`
			`	She re-sheaths her swords and calls you over, "I have brought with me one of the greatest war heroes of the humans."`

				`	(Walk to her.)`
			`	"Captain <first> <last> led great fleets during a civil war of the humans. I have seen his valor in battle as he's escorted my ship through pirate space. We will have the honor of fighting alongside him."`
			`	The Unfettered leader turns to you and says, "I look forward to seeing you fight. We cannot spare a large fleet though, so I will need your people to upgrade ten Shield Beetles to our specifications. We'll return your outfits after the battle." He motions to another officer who hands him a data card, "These are the instructions."`
			`	Teeneep smiles at you, "Return to Hai-home and inform the Elders that an Unfettered fleet will arrive. We must then arrange for Prime to outfit our ships. When all is ready I and the Unfettered ships will rendezvous with you at Allhome."`

			`	"Well have no fear, I can definitely do that!" Within a few short minutes you seem to have lifted a handful of years off of Xilin's worried features.`
			`	"I'll sort out the approvals, and I'm sure the Marshal can sort out the logistics. Give me the details and we'll have it all waiting for you on Prime by the time you arrive."`

Korath, Hai, and Humans live peacefully, working side-by-side, and most have no desire to leave. They value their independence and have refused Republic membership. This city orbits a strange world that defies analysis in a region of space that has never been touched by civilization. Quarg refuse to go here, and Drak consider it outside their domain.`

			`General Choot'k cuts open the doors of a large hangar and your ships land. Two hundred operatives pour out. They're wearing exoskeletons with built-in shields. As they storm through the complex, you follow some of them.`
			`	Their guns are able to literally melt away meter-thick walls in seconds. They have gas bombs that release an extremely powerful stun gas which knocks people out for hours. The pirates outnumber the Republic operatives twenty-five to one, but this huge advantage in equipment, combined with training, gives the operatives a fighting chance.`
			`	The operatives move room to room, neutralising all opposition with ease until the pirates switch tactics. They begin using electromagnetic pulse devices to shut down the suits (and all other electronics nearby). This leaves the operatives helpless for about ten seconds.`
			`	After a bloody struggle, forty-three surviving operatives win the fight, clearing the way to a large blast door. The vast door is twelve meters high and wide, and scanners show it to be six meters deep. The operatives focus all of their suits' firepower on one part of the door, eventually burning a hole through it. They pass through into the darkness of the next room.`

				`	Follow them.`
			`	Scanners show the room to be a vast cavern; some sort of meeting room suitable for ten thousand people or more. It is pitch black when you come in. Once all operatives are inside, a second blast door closes behind you and lights turn on. The room is as bright as day.`
			`	You see before you several hundred pirate corpses a few thousand heavily-armed civilians all pointing guns at the operatives. It seems the citizens have arranged a violent rebellion to coincide with the Republic's attack. Three unarmed civilians walk towards the operatives: one Hai, one human, and one Korath. The leader of the Republic operatives exits her suit and approaches them.`
			`	The Hai speaks, "We are the leaders of the civilian government of Philosopher's Paradise. Although we are grateful for your assistance in defeating our violent rulers, we will not accept your dominion either. We know what you did to the Free Worlds. Philosopher's Paradise is an independent nation; we will never join the Republic."`
			`	"I promise our country will turn to peace, and we will send no military ships through the wormhole."`

			`	The Korath leader tells you, "A few years ago, three of our ships jumped into the Alcyone system to raid. Numerous pirate vessels left Stormhold and disabled all of our ships. A large human ship boarded our flagship. All we heard was screaming; the pirates used deadly gas to kill the entire crew."`
			`	"You call it, 'nerve gas.' The death is excruciatingly painful to Korath. Not wanting that fate, the crews of the second and third Korath vessels surrendered. Now we're here, safe, and free. We are not scientists like the others here, but we help as we can." The other two leaders smile at him gratefully.`
			# Apparently you're not the only one who can pack a Bactrian with

			# adventurous enough to capture the ships.
			`	"The pirates must defend this planet against a space-based lifeform that attacks in flocks. Our ships gave them a significant advantage. Fortunately we have one more left, to defend against any threats." He eyes the Republic operatives as he says that.`
			`	The Korath leader continues, "I must ask you hold secret the presence of Korath here. If the other Exiles hear of this place, they may attack to retrieve us, or simply to pillage. We will remain here in hiding until Korath space is safe."`

			`	The Hai leader continues, "That is excellent, that was the plan. Our overlords ordered us to make microtranceivers to track their prey. The microtranceivers were a combination of Hai medical microbots and what our Korath friends here could tell us. None of the Korath were scientists, but the principles of their science are part of their engineers' training. With their knowledge, we augmented the transceivers to transmit in hyperspace as well, hoping it would lead someone back here."`

			`	The three leaders laugh. The Hai answers, "We are home. This is a place of learning where three races join as one to seek knowledge. Some recent kidnapping victims wish to leave. We will help you find them and send them home."`
			`	The Korath speaks next, "Where my people come from, everyone is starving, barely subsisting. We have to raid for supplies, and those of us who refuse to fight are treated poorly. This is a much better place for us."`
			`	The human leader says, "Most of the humans in this city have been here for several generations. This has always been home to us."`

			`	"We understand you have heard most of the story from your spy. This place was founded over a hundred twenty years ago by anarchists from the colony of Freedom. With the Syndicate on their doorstep, some of them evolved into anarcho-syndicalists and attempted to bring it down from within. To do this, they allied with less peaceful anarchists and pirates. Those less savory types kidnapped researchers and engineers, forcing them to devise new weapons or medicines, and who eventually inherited control here after the syndicalists were wiped out. Our city also has manufacturing facilities where we created goods the pirates could not easily build in human space where their facilities are destroyed regularly."`
			`	"There have been various attempts to take the city by force or by money. Early on there were attempts by Alpha groups, and then various illegal organizations who tracked this place down from rumours about their rivals. There was even someone from the Syndicate who came with his personal fleet, though none of them returned home from that attempt. Some used chemical or biological weapons, others sent ships. Many offered money or favors. Philosopher's Paradise has always been an independent country, and always will be."`
			`	"Now that the pirates are gone, us civilians may rule without fear, and for that you have our gratitude. As the upper region of the city has already been destroyed, we have little to fear from attack by space creatures in the short-term, and soon we'll have our shipyards at full capacity such that we may defend ourselves."`
			`	"We won't ever join the Republic or any other government beyond the wormhole but you personally will always be welcome, along with those you trust, for what you have done today. Our research and manufacturing facilities are damaged now, but as they are repaired we will make them available to you."`

Under the pirates, we were allowed this freedom, as they realized it was the most effective way to get results from scientists. Now that our abusive masters are gone, our research will take peaceful routes."`
			`	"Of course, this is also a city. People have lived here for several generations, multiplying fruitfully. We have had to carve out more and more of the moon. There is plenty of space left before our growth will have to stop."`
				goto questions

			`	"Very little. The pirates wouldn't let us leave the planet, and jump drives are precious to them. They cannot risk drives on science expeditions. Still, we have managed a few trips."`
			`	"There is no evidence that any civilization has ever reached this region of space until us. There are many space-faring indigenous creatures that live in gas giants, and sometimes venture beyond. Most are harmless, so long as you leave them alone. There are flocking apex predators who hunt anything that moves. We suspect there is a north route from here to another galaxy, though we cannot find the starlanes yet."`
			# The starlanes are not concealed. "We cannot find the starlanes" is a

			`	"The planet below is a mystery to us. It has a thousand times the mass than it should and its gravitational field reads as such from a great distance. This tremendous gravitational field sustains the large asteroid belt. Somehow though, despite its incredible mass, as you approach the surface the field does not increase at anywhere near the rate that it should, and so when you stand upon it the gravity is only similar to that of Earth. There are many forms of radiation and strange materials inside the planet's caves. Perhaps, now that we are not developing pirate weapons, we can focus on exploration."`

			`	Anticipating your next question, she says, "The ships of the True Hai will be escorted back with us since the Philosophers are convinced they are at no risk, and still have a ship at their disposal. Some of the True Hai have chosen to remain here and join the philosophers. More than enough bunks have subsequently been freed to return those who have chosen to come home with us. We will have to transport the surviving operatives back to Foundry, the Republic should be able to look after them again from there."`
