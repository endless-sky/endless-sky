# You as the player have one job: make sure everyone jumps in together, and don't die. During the first campaign it was really important the fights were all balanced for you to be able to tip the balance.
# THIS mission is designed to give you a spectacle. A little visual demonstration of what a real battle could potentially look and feel like with low stakes for you. It's a visual feast, not a challenge.

"When I was a teenager, pirates kidnapped my brother and father, and forced them to serve on pirate vessels, calling them 'indentured servants.' My father watched helplessly as my brother's disabled ship was destroyed by a Navy Frigate just as it exited hyperspace. He eventually escaped - but he's now serving his seventeenth year of a twenty-five-year sentence for piracy, even though his deeds were against his will," Moray explains as he leads you into a large building.`

Yes, they do many good deeds, but those deeds blind us to their brutality and immorality. Not all humans are like that - many members of the Navy disagree with the barbaric rules about slavery. Some of us in the Syndicate, Free Worlds, and elsewhere, are trying to solve this problem."`

There is a pirate gang with an extensive array of contacts in organized crime both up in the Far North and closer to home within the Syndicate - possibly even Syndicate executives. I can say for sure though that they're definitely doing this without the permission of the Syndicate proper. I swear to you that I will do everything in my power to track down whoever is responsible for this reprehensible act. They will be brought to justice.`

Many of our people have been kidnapped over the past few decades, and some still reside beyond the wormhole at Devil-Run. Worst of all, your authorities have killed numerous Hai on slaver ships, without attempting rescue or even offering the opportunity to surrender. We demand the return of our people and an immediate end to the killing of slaves."`
			`	The President is the first to respond. "The problem of piracy in human space is a difficult one and cannot be solved overnight. The pirates are well-entrenched in their planets, and fighting them is a long and brutal struggle. With our navies distracted fighting one another, our recent war has left them stronger than ever."`
			`	The Chancellor continues, "The Free Worlds has made great strides reducing piracy by befriending the peoples of the anarchist worlds. We're discussing similar approaches with the Republic. Perhaps in another few years, piracy will be entirely eliminated."`
			`	"We have a counter-proposal," the President says. "The Free Worlds and Republic will establish a customs service on Mountaintop. Hai visiting human space will check in with us there. Our intelligence agencies will then track their movements in order to see to their safety as best we can. They'll also be given contacts on every human planet that they can go to for help. In the meantime, we will place extensive surveillance fleets at Ultima Thule to detect any unapproved Hai travel. We will do our best to disable and capture ships with kidnapped Hai, no matter the risk to Navy lives."`

			`	Teeneep takes a step forward, pauses, then turns back to you. "Actually, there was something I wanted to make sure I explained before we meet the Unfettered leadership: I'm carrying real weapons for a reason. This meeting will probably seem violent, and that will probably make you think the Unfettered are a barbaric people. They're not; they 'play up' their violent nature. It's a hard concept to explain - we have Hai words for this that don't translate well into your language. That's the simplest way I can think to explain it without spending twenty minutes here, so it'll have to suffice."`
			`	She glances around. "Besides, we're already close to running late. Let's get going."`
			`	You pass through a hallway filled with battle trophies and enter a large room filled with uniformed Hai. You notice many of them have swords similar to Teeneep's, though they look more ceremonial than functional.`
			`	As Teeneep walks in, an Unfettered moves to block her path. From the extensive decorations on his uniform, it appears he's a high-ranking officer. "You're not welcome here, False Hai." He starts to push her away. In one motion, Teeneep spins around, unsheathes a sword, and swipes it across his arm, drawing blood. The Hai grunts, surprised, and steps aside to let Teeneep pass. She walks toward the gigantic leader of the Unfettered, whose face betrays his surprise and admiration.`

			label watch
			`	Teeneep explains to the leader, "Twenty thousand Hai have been enslaved by human pirates. They're concealed in a subterranean base that can only be reached with both a Jump Drive and a Quantum Keystone. Dozens of human capital ships and thousands of human pirates guard the Hai. We haven't enough Jump Drives to rescue them.`
			# Note: Teeneep is using hyperbole; she knows most of the 20,000 Hai at Philosopher's Paradise were probably born there.
			`	"You were once the protectors of all Hai. I ask you be so again. Free our people from slavery and kill their human slavers."`
			`	The Unfettered leader responds, "Your people have outlawed and abandoned us. You give us insulting food donations with propaganda on them. You block our ships from returning to Hai-home. Why should we help you, a race of slothful cowards? Your people are an insult to all Hai."`
			`	Teeneep suddenly takes three strides forward, closing the distance between her and the Unfettered leader in less than a second. You had forgotten how quick Hai are; few humans could do what she just did. "I challenge you for rule of the Unfettered military!"`
			`	"You haven't the authority to do that," he responds, laughing.`
			`	Teeneep draws a throwing knife and launches it. It zips through the air, passing within a hand's width of the Unfettered leader before embedding itself in the wall behind. "Fight me! Are you afraid to fight a woman half your size? Fight me, coward!" From her expression, you're unsure if she genuinely has that much faith in her abilities, or if this is a bluff.`
			`	The Unfettered leader pauses, then smiles. "There is no need. Even on our planets, I've rarely met a Hai half as brave as you. You are a True Hai, and we protect our own. You have vouched for the value of the lives of these Hai, so we will send a fleet to rescue them. I will lead the attack myself."`

We cannot spare a large fleet though, so I will need your people to upgrade ten Shield Beetles to our specifications. We'll return your outfits after the battle." He motions to another officer, who hands him a data card. "These are the instructions."`

			`General Choot'k cuts open the doors of a large hangar, and your ships land. The two hundred operatives pour out, wearing exoskeletons with built-in shields. As they storm through the complex, you follow some of them. Their guns melt away meter-thick walls in seconds, and they have have gas bombs which can knock people out for hours. The pirates outnumber the Republic operatives two dozen to one, but this huge advantage in equipment, combined with training, gives the operatives a fighting chance.`
			`	The squads move room to room, neutralizing all opposition with ease until their opponents switch tactics. The pirates begin using electromagnetic pulse devices to shut down the suits (and all other electronics nearby), leaving the operatives helpless for about ten seconds.`
			`	After a bloody struggle, forty-three surviving operatives win the fight, clearing the way to a large blast door. The vast door is twelve meters high and wide, and scanners show it to be six meters deep. The operatives focus all of their suits' firepower on one part of the door, eventually burning a hole through it. They pass through into the darkness of the next room.`

				`	(Follow them.)`
			`	Scanners show the room to be a vast cavern, some sort of meeting room suitable for ten thousand people or more. It's pitch black when you enter. Once all operatives are inside, a second blast door closes behind you, and lights turn on making the room as bright as day.`
			`	You see before you a couple hundred pirates, held captive by a large crowd of heavily-armed civilians - all of which are now hesitantly pointing guns at the operatives. It seems the citizens have arranged a violent rebellion to coincide with the Republic's attack. Three unarmed civilians walk towards the operatives: one Hai, one human, and one Korath. The leader of the Republic operatives exits her suit and approaches them.`
			`	The Hai speaks. "We are the leaders of the civilian government of Philosopher's Paradise. Although we are grateful for your assistance in defeating our violent rulers, we will not accept your dominion either. We have heard of your war with the Free Worlds. Philosopher's Paradise is an independent nation; we will never join the Republic. I can, however, promise our country will turn to peace, and we will send no military ships through the wormhole."`

			`	The Korath leader begins speak, with the Hai translating. "Several generations ago, three of our raiding ships jumped into the Alcyone system. Numerous pirate vessels left Stormhold and disabled all of our ships. A large human ship boarded our flagship while us on the other two vessels listened over communicators. All we heard was screaming. The pirates used deadly gas - what you call 'nerve gas' - to kill the entire crew.  The death is excruciatingly painful to Korath. Not wanting that fate, most of the raiders on the second and third Korath ships mutinied and then surrendered. We worked as slaves for the pirate gangs, but now we're here, safe, and free. We are not scientists like the others here, but we help as we can.`
			`	"The pirates must defend this planet against a space-based lifeform that attacks in flocks. Our ships gave them a significant advantage. Fortunately, we have one more left defend against any threats." The Korath eyes the Republic operatives as he waits for the translator to catch up.`
			`	"I must ask you keep the presence of Korath here a secret. If the Archons or other Exiles hear of this place, they may attack to retrieve us, or the Exiles may simply pillage. We will remain here in hiding unless the Exiles finally learn to settle on their planet."`
				goto questions

			`	The Korath leader looks to the Hai, who responds, "Is that how you were led back here?"`
			`	"Yes," you reply.`
			`	The Hai leader continues, "Excellent! That was the plan. Our overlords ordered us to create a means of tracking their prey. The microtransceivers were a combination of Hai medical microbots and what our Korath friends here could tell us. None of the surviving Korath were scientists, but many of them seemed to have an uncanny knack for engineering. With their help, we augmented the transceivers to transmit in hyperspace as well, hoping it would lead someone back here."`
			`	The human leader adds, "I can scarcely believe it worked, but I'm very glad it did."`
				goto questions
			label home
			`	The three leaders laugh. The Hai answers, "We are home. This is a place of learning, where three races join as one to seek knowledge. Some recent kidnapping victims wish to leave. We will help you find them and send them home."`
			`	The Korath speaks next, and the Hai translates. "Where my people came from, everyone was starving, barely subsisting. We had to raid for supplies, or slave away in bleak factory stations. This is a much better place for us."`
			`	The human leader concludes, "Most of the humans in this city have been here for several generations. This has always been home to us."`
				goto questions
			label place
			`	"We understand you have heard some of the story from your spy," the human replies, "but I am happy to fill in the details. This place was founded over a hundred twenty years ago by anarchists from the colony of Freedom. With the Syndicate on their doorstep, some of them evolved into anarcho-syndicalists and attempted to bring it down from within. To do this, they allied with less peaceful anarchists and pirates. Those less savory types kidnapped researchers and engineers, forcing them to devise new weapons or medicines, and who eventually inherited control here after the syndicalists were wiped out. Our city also has manufacturing facilities where we created goods the pirates could not easily build in human space, where their facilities are destroyed regularly.`
			`	"There have been various attempts to take the city by force or by money. Early on, there were attempts by Alpha groups, and then various illegal organizations who tracked this place down from rumors about their rivals. There was even someone from the Syndicate who came with his personal fleet, though none of them returned home from that attempt. Some used chemical or biological weapons, others sent ships. Many offered money or favors. Philosopher's Paradise has always been an independent country, and always will be.`
			`	"Now that the pirates are gone, us civilians may rule without fear, and for that you have our gratitude. As the upper region of the city has already been destroyed, we have little to fear from attack by space creatures in the short-term, and soon we'll have our shipyards at full capacity such that we may defend ourselves.`
			`	"We won't ever join the Republic or any other government beyond the wormhole, but you personally will always be welcome, along with those you trust, for what you have done today. Our research and manufacturing facilities are damaged now, but as they are repaired, we will make them available to you."`

			`	"We're scientists, engineers, philosophers, people of learning. There are laboratories throughout this city where people from all three races work together. We seek knowledge. Under the pirates, we were allowed this freedom, as they realized it was the most effective way to get results from scientists. Now that our abusive masters are gone, our research will take peaceful routes."`
			`	"Of course, this is also a city. People have lived here for several generations, multiplying fruitfully. We have had to carve out more and more of the moon. There is plenty of space left before our growth will have to stop."`
				goto questions
			label space
			`	"Very little. The pirates wouldn't let us leave the planet, and jump drives are precious to them. They cannot risk drives on science expeditions. Still, we have managed a few trips."`
			`	"There is no evidence that any civilization has ever reached this region of space until us. There are many space-faring indigenous creatures that live in gas giants, and sometimes venture beyond. Most are harmless, so long as you leave them alone. There are flocking apex predators who hunt anything that moves.`
			`	"The planet below is a mystery to us. It has a thousand times the mass it realistically should, and its gravitational field reads as such from a great distance. This tremendous gravitational field sustains the large asteroid belt. Despite its incredible mass, as you approach the surface, the field does not increase at anywhere near the rate that it should. Thus, when you stand upon it, the gravity is only similar to that of Earth. There are many forms of radiation and strange materials inside the planet's caves. Perhaps, now that we are not developing pirate weapons, we can focus on exploration."`

Some of them have chosen to remain here and join the philosophers. More than enough bunks have subsequently been freed to return those who have chosen to come home with us.

		conversation
			`You read Teeneep's contact information for Tarazed Shipyards, and it talks about a man named Goraz Zoltof who works in their communications research laboratory. There's an address and detailed information about the man, whose wife went missing under mysterious circumstances some time ago. After a series of shuttles and trains, you reach his house and knock on the door.`
			`	He's a little groggy, but manages to ask, "Yes?" You explain about the microtransceivers, the Quarg, and the kidnappings. You avoid mentioning that some of the people are Hai, just in case he's never heard of them. He seems to awaken immediately. "You found a lead on my wife's disappearance? Yes, I think I can help you. Let's go to my laboratory at once."`
			choice
				`	(Head to the laboratory.)`
			`	After another series of shuttles and trains, you reach what looks like a spaceport. From the extra equipment and unusual ship designs, you realize it is a research shipyard. Goraz's laboratory is an entire docking bay with a modified Blackbird. Despite its size, it is conspicuously absent any other personnel. He takes you on board and, noting your attention to your surroundings, explains that he has few assistants that are typically off-world most of the time as he walks you to the communications room.`
			`	"Here, let me take a look at what you've brought me." He takes the data card you got from the Quarg and plugs it into the communicator. After several minutes of typing and muttering incoherently to himself he pauses as a simulation plays on his screen. You're not sure exactly what you're looking at, but when it finishes he lets out a long slow breath and comments to himself in a low voice. "Bastijn Biesterveld, you absolute legend. He was right - it's the interference."`
			`	He turns back to you and explains. "Normally interference isn't something that's logged, but when you're in civilized space with hyperspace relays, your ship does a final handshake with the local relay station as it jumps. That station sends that handshake signature to the destination station so it knows exactly who you are to be able to reconnect communications at the other end. It's a fully automatic process, and it's independent of ship IDs. It's just buried in there as a check from back in the days when hyperdrives would occasionally explode and we'd need to work out who went missing. It gets logged and automatically overwritten every couple days, and someone would probably have gotten rid of it if it wasn't so deeply baked into the way the system works. If you know when a ship jumped and where it jumped to, you can use it to confirm it didn't blow up; and if there's something wrong with the communications equipment you can use the log info to identify if a specific ship is the same ship talking to you later, but neither of those are particularly useful since the same information can be acquired more easily and in much higher quality through other means."`
			`	He pauses, realizing he's been rambling. "Sorry, that was probably way more explanation than you needed. There's a small group of us comms people that have lost people, or know people who have, that the authorities can't help. We're scattered all over and we've been looking at this ourselves. Together we identified some ships we thought were suspicious, but we've not been able to pin down anything concrete. Bastijn was convinced there was a pattern of interference signatures from the logs; he made the analysis program, but it was never definitively distinct from the noise. Now though, well, what you've given me is a match!"`
			`	He casts around for a moment and then plugs a freshly unpacked data card into his console. "Give me a little time: I can do something for you now. I'll be back with you in ten minutes."`
			choice
				`	(Sit down.)`
				`	(Stand around idly.)`
			`	After some time, in which he looks like he's installing a series of programs, he returns your original data card and the second one, now loaded up with whatever he was putting on it. "Load this new card into one of your communicator's extra data storage slots, preferably the first one. This new card will run maintenance level processes with the communicator to download the logs from the local station when you enter a system, match the log signatures for ships that are in-system, and code up extra info for their ID's. Functionally, they'll show up as 'Smuggler' on your display. You'll have to hunt for them though, cause you'll have to be in the same system as them for any of this to work.`
			`	"Also... maybe keep this quiet. This is," he pauses and clears his throat conspicuously, "somewhat less than strictly legal, though there's no penalty attached to accessing the data at the level this card will use. You should focus your search on the uninhabited areas between the Far North and Syndicate space, plus any nearby pirate systems. That's where we've noticed the most suspicious activity."`
			`	All business and technical explanation now out of the way, you watch as the reality of what's happening seems to suddenly sink in, and his demeanor changes suddenly as his eyes shine with faint hope, "And please, if you do find my wife Janitza... please bring her home."`
			choice
				`	(Return to your ship.)`
			`	After one last ride through the shuttles and trains of <origin>, you arrive at your ship. You plug the data card into your computer, and a new "government" shows up: Smuggler. The ships will be colored differently than pirates.`
			`	It may be risky, but you should disable one and board it.`
			`	Teeneep gave you the name of a contact within a historical archive on <destination>. She wants you to speak to a woman named Giti Gilani if you find one of the smuggling ships. Giti specializes in history of ship designs and space-faring groups, including the Hai.`

			`	When you arrive, Giti tells you, "This is a religious materials archive. Give me a minute here..." Her voice trails off as she starts typing on a terminal. She walks back and forth between several bookshelves skimming books for a few minutes.`
			`	"I found it," she says. "This is a modified version of the Symbol of Baphomet, the official symbol of an older incarnation of the Church of Satan. Contrary to popular belief at the time, they were never devil-worshipers of any sort. Instead, they believed in a sort of rationalist individualism and were one of the first organizations to fund large-scale settlements on Freedom. Since then, the symbol has been co-opted by miscreants.`
			`	"But you didn't come here for a theological history disquisition. The letters around the pentagram have been replaced with galactic coordinates using an archaic notation." She smiles at you, "I wrote my Ph.D. thesis about that notation! Now I finally need that information for something other than getting a degree!`
			`	"The circle around the symbol looks almost like a wormhole. A red wormhole. I heard about one in Terminus near The Deep. Apparently nobody is able to enter one without their ship being torn to pieces. This symbol suggests there's another one in the middle of Syndicate space.`
			`	"Fly through the wormhole at the coordinates on that card, if you can, come back and tell me what you see. In the meantime, I'll ask other researchers about the microtransceivers."`
			choice
				`	(Thank her and return to your ship.)`
			`	Upon returning to your ship, you ponder Giti's findings. The coordinates are for a system in Syndicate space that is not reachable by hyperlane, so you'll need a jump drive. The red wormhole requires another key.`
			`	Once you've passed through that wormhole, hopefully Giti will have more information for you.`

			`	As soon as she sees you she asks, "What did you find out?" You explain your journey to her.`
			`	She responds, "Wait... I... lemme check..." followed by some typing on a nearby terminal. "Yes, you're right. In the late 21st century, there was an effort to map stars in that intergalactic region. By all rights these stars should not have been so visible, but some strange anomaly made that part of the sky clearer for a while. The strangest thing we spotted was not a star; it was some kind of object with unknown properties that confused our scanners. Even today I'm not sure we'd make sense of it, but the anomaly passed, and we couldn't even make an attempt now."`

There's a huge network of caves and caverns coated with a crystal that is radiating... something the computer can't identify... and deuterium. The denizens of this system siphon the deuterium to make hyperspace fuel. Also, the planet has about a thousand times the mass it should, but somehow the gravity is around Earth normal."`

They have hydroponics, big cargo bays, docking bays for ships, and some spacious living areas.

			`The Earth authorities give you an unusual landing vector that leads to a secret docking bay below ground in Argentina. You land, and a Navy cadet meets you at your ship with an urgent message: "Republic Intelligence and a Navy Marshal want to see you as soon as possible. They have news about your microtransceiver transmissions. Please follow me."`
			`	Giti adds, "I'll take the scanners and data to some researchers and let you know when I have more information. Please go with the cadet. It sounds like you'll finally get some answers."`
			`	The cadet takes you to an elevator just outside your ship, down more than three hundred floors to a large meeting room. Within, you see two men and a woman in formal dress. One man has a Republic Intelligence uniform with the name "Agent Kopkow". Another wears a Navy full dress uniform that you don't immediately recognize. After a moment of thought, you realize he is a Marshal, the second-highest rank in the Navy, answering only to the Grand Marshal. His uniform is labeled "Adurath Kaine". The woman is a Navy captain wearing the prominent Parliamentary Medal of Valor. Her name label says "Captain Anna Wallace."`

			`	You've had few dealings with Republic Intelligence, but you know what everyone knows. They're the top police force of the Republic, dealing with high-profile civilian crimes that local authorities can't handle: murder investigations, interplanetary kidnappings, and the like. They also gather intelligence throughout human space, and possibly beyond, reporting directly to the Republic Parliament.`
			`	There are only five Navy Marshals, and one Grand Marshal; this man's high rank means he reports to Parliament regularly. People this high in the Navy tend to deal more with political issues rather than combat or strategy, so you wonder why they picked him to talk to you.`
			`	The Parliamentary Medal of Valor is only given to one person per year; this captain must have done something especially heroic. She must also have supporters in Parliament to receive the award in the first place. That will give her some freedom to act independently, like Danforth does.`
			`	The three of them are looking at you confused, wondering why you've stopped and stared at them for a half minute.`

			`	Marshal Kaine introduces himself. "I'm the Marshal of the Third Armada, the guards of the Far North and the uninhabited regions near it. I know you've met one of my admirals, Danforth that is, a good man - albeit one who flouts the rules a bit too much." He gives a stern look at Captain Wallace. "Some of my carriers have detected the signals you've found. Actually, we see them quite regularly in the ships of known slave runners. The runners don't always carry slaves; they do other smuggling missions as well."`
			`	Agent Kopkow speaks his piece next. "Sometimes the runners do carry slaves, and we have found humans or Hai in crashed slaver ships. We returned the Hai to their homes, as you did, but they didn't know Republic Intelligence helped them. Several merchants have done the same. About one in seven we rescued were researchers, which is an extremely disproportionate amount when you consider the number of researchers in human and Hai space. Clearly, they're being targeted."`
			`	Kaine continues, "That, unfortunately, is where we have some bad news. Parliament has a strict policy on pirates and slaver ships: destroy on sight. This is a tradition that goes back long before the era of space travel. Raiding pirate ships is a deadly affair; numerous Navy or police will be killed. While it may seem heroic, the casualty rate is unsustainable. The only effective way to discourage piracy is to destroy the ships. If you don't believe me, try catching some yourself and count your dead."`
			`	Captain Wallace concludes, "That means many slaves are killed, including some Hai researchers."`
			`	Kaine says, "We informed the Hai government while you were away, and they've responded by moving fleets towards the wormhole; we're doing the same. By the time you arrive, there will be large fleets on both sides of the wormhole. This could quickly lead to war. Please take the message back to Teeneep and the Hai victims with our condolences. Captain, please see <first> <last> back to the <ship>."`
			choice
				`	(Return to your ship.)`
			`	Along the way, Captain Wallace tells you stories of Navy heroism and brutality towards slaver vessels. Apparently many officers like her disagree with the Navy's policy. They want to rescue slaves whenever possible, regardless of risk or orders.`
			`	She was awarded for personally leading a charge deep into pirate space to rescue a group of over a hundred high-school students that were captured on a field trip to Shroud. That led to her court-martial and conviction for disobeying a direct order. She was pardoned by the Prime Minister upon receiving the Parliamentary Award for Valor.`
			`	When you reach your ship, she hands you a business card. "Please have the Hai victims talk to this man. He's part of Syndicate Internal Affairs and may be able to help. He and I... share common goals."`
