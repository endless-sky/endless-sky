# The fact that you have to actively go to the spaceport to proc this mission is intentional. It allows the player to take a pause to reorganize themselves if they need to, B01 stays active as a reminder.
# The fight in this mission is very large, but it's also a complete roflstomp. The pirates are outnumbered 2-1, and out-gunned significantly worse than that.
# You as the player have one job: make sure everyone jumps in together, and don't die. During the first campaign it was really important the fights were all balanced for you to be able to tip the balance.
# THIS mission is designed to give you a spectacle. A little visual demonstration of what a real battle could potentially look and feel like with low stakes for you. It's a visual feast, not a challenge.

You are also unable to use it, but you have the nearly exclusive freedom to leave and re-enter the blockaded region of space.

There they go through the information on known or possible smuggling operations that they, the republic, and Syndicate had reconciled, and what they hadn't. Unfortunately, while many matches were found - which led to this occupation of Stormhold - there was nothing in the new data sets which was able to be conclusively linked to anything associated with the mysterious symbol. And no human escapees had ever been tested for mild cadmium poisoning, so that was a dead end too.>`

They're the top police force of the Republic, dealing with high-profile civilian crimes that local authorities can't handle: murder investigations, interplanetary kidnappings, and the like.

"That requires an act of parliament in a closed session, which has not occurred for a significant length of time, if you catch my drift."`

After a short commute by subway you reach his house and knock on the door.`
			`	He's a little groggy, but manages to ask, "Yes?" You explain about the kidnappings and how your colleague thinks his theory is worth investigating. You avoid mentioning that some of the people are Hai, just in case he's never heard of them. He seems to awaken immediately. "You found a lead on my wife's disappearance? Wait, you're with 'BookWyrm23'?!" He turns and steps into a pair of slip-on shoes while grabbing a jacket. "Let's go to my laboratory at once! I can show you."`

			label lead
			`	You clarify that technically it's a lead on cases that match the same profile as his wife's, not strictly his wife's case. His expression falters momentarily and then he seems to find some internal resolve to draw upon. "Good enough for me... Thank you, for your honesty."`
			label lab
			`	After a short return trip, you reach what looks like a small private spaceport. From the extra equipment and unusual ship designs, you realize it must be one of Tarazed's research shipyards. Goraz's laboratory is an entire docking bay with a modified Blackbird. Despite its size, it is conspicuously absent any other personnel. He takes you on board and, noting your attention to your surroundings, explains that he has few assistants that are typically off-world most of the time as he walks you to the communications room.`
			`	"Here, let me take a look at what you've brought me." He takes the data stick you brought and plugs it into the communicator. After several minutes of mucking about with list formats and muttering incoherently to himself he pauses as a search result collates matches on his screen. You're not sure exactly what you're looking at, but when it finishes he lets out a long slow breath and comments to himself in a low voice. "Bastijn Biesterveld, you absolute legend. He was right - it's the interference."`
			`	He turns back to you and explains. "Normally interference isn't something that's logged, but when you're in civilized space with hyperspace relays, your ship does a final handshake with the local relay station as it jumps. That station sends that handshake signature to the destination station so it knows exactly who you are to be able to reconnect communications at the other end. It's a fully automatic process, and it's independent of ship IDs. It's just buried in there as a check from back in the days when hyperdrives would occasionally explode and we'd need to work out who went missing. It gets logged and automatically overwritten every couple days, and someone would probably have gotten rid of it if it wasn't so deeply baked into the way the system works. If you know when a ship jumped and where it jumped to, you can use it to confirm it didn't blow up; and if there's something wrong with the communications equipment you can use the log info to identify if a specific ship is the same ship talking to you later, but neither of those are particularly useful since the same information can be acquired more easily and in much higher quality through other means."`
			`	He pauses, realizing he's been rambling. "Sorry, that was probably way more explanation than you needed. There's a small group of us comms people that have lost people, or know people who have, that the authorities can't help. We're scattered all over and we've been looking at this ourselves. Together we identified some ships we thought were suspicious, but we've not been able to pin down anything concrete. Bastijn was convinced there was a pattern of interference signatures from the logs; he made the analysis program, but it was never definitively distinct from the noise. This data set you've brought though, well, once you filter for the subset of ships in our data set, what you've given me matches so completely to the set of ships we've found with interference that it has to be a match! Ninety-eight point five percent confidence interval completely annihilates the idea that it could be random."`
			`	He casts around for a moment and then plugs a freshly unpacked data card into his console. "Give me a little time: I can do something for you now. I'll be back with you in ten minutes."`
			choice
				`	(Sit down.)`
				`	(Stand around idly.)`
			`	After some time, in which he looks like he's installing a series of programs, he returns your original data card and the second one, now loaded up with whatever he was putting on it. "Load this new card into one of your communicator's extra data storage slots, preferably the first one. This new card will run maintenance level processes with the communicator to download the logs from the local relay when you enter a system, match the log signatures for ships that are in-system, and code up extra info for their ID's. Functionally, they'll show up as 'Smuggler' on your display. You'll have to hunt for them though, cause you'll have to be in the same system as them for any of this to work.`
			`	"Also... maybe keep this quiet. This is," he pauses and clears his throat conspicuously, "somewhat less than strictly legal, though there's no penalty attached to accessing the data at the level this card will use. My data sets only only cover coreward parts of Syndicate space, but your other data is heavily weighted to the Far North. Maybe if you have no luck in Syndicate space it'll be worth the trip to try up there."`
			`	All business and technical explanation now out of the way, you watch as the reality of what's happening seems to suddenly sink in, and his demeanor changes suddenly as his eyes shine with faint hope, "And please, if you do find my wife Janitza... please bring her home."`
			choice
				`	(Return to your ship.)`
			`	After one last ride through the metro system of <origin>, you arrive at your ship. You plug the data card into your computer, and a new "government" shows up: Smuggler. The ships will be colored differently than pirates.`
			`	It may be risky, but you should disable one and board it.`

			`As you maneuver to board this ship you send a message telling them that you know they're smugglers and demand their surrender. There is no response, but once you dock and open your side of the airlock, the door to the smuggler ship <origin> also opens partway and a Hai pokes their head through. The Hai's eyes are wide with fear but also determination as they shout at you through the docking tube, "This door is jammed, they're locking down the ship and going to blow it up!"`
			`	In the background you hear a booming sound. "They're using the keystones, tell them they're using the keystones!"`
			`	Inside your own ship you hear danger alarms suddenly blare into full volume and you have just enough time to nod a clear acknowledgment to the doomed Hai before your airlock slams shut with automatic safeties. A moment later, you hear a very large explosion and the sound of tearing metal as the docking tube is shredded and your ship rocks as it is forced away from the expanding debris of the smuggler ship. When you return to the controls it seems the smugglers signaled for help before the ship exploded. An escape pod is rapidly escaping and pirate signatures are on a swift approach. Apparently the smugglers care more about not being caught than about finishing their mission.`

You begin to set a course for <planet>, but your scanners report multiple new contacts; hostile ships entering the system. You prepare for battle.`

			`The progressive search of <origin> still seems to be underway, and a cursory question directed to the Navy personnel now managing the spaceport indicates that they're less than happy about it. Despite the Navy promising to leave as soon as they've searched and confirmed the status of a handful of remaining pirate gang's hideouts; those gangs remain resolutely hidden and haven't been exposed by any of their compatriots as yet.`
			`	Fortunately this makes it easy to find Sayari who has comparatively little to do at the moment and is mostly just helping to keep everyone communicating effectively. When you tell her of the system you found and the message from the Hai on the smuggler ship she winces. "What a terrible fate, but it does confirm what we suspected. We'll have to see what more we can find out in the meantime while we're still bogged down here."`
			`	"The message though, I can only assume they must have been using Keystones to indicate respect for traditional superstitions. I fear it has lured some Hai into thinking they're trustworthy when they were clearly not. Perhaps there is more though. We have folktales of these stones making travel between the stars easier, and our space once extended to this region where the wormhole is. It is possible there may be a relation."`
			`	She chuckles, "Maybe it is fortunate I insisted you have one for me to travel on your ship. If our quantum keystones have some effect on the wormhole...  Please, continue your investigation, talk to whoever you need to talk to, and don't go unprepared. This may be key to a peaceful resolution at the end of all this."`
			`	"Oh by the way," she stops you before you leave, "in case you were wondering; certain people have noticed that you have had close interactions with Teeneep and I through this, and questions have indeed been asked as to whether you are responsible for the mess that was caused by Teeneep going public with the information you helped her find." Her expression is very serious. "We have not told them absolutely every detail, but we have made it clear to your diplomats that the issue was a matter which would have blocked any solution until it was resolved, regardless of if you helped or not. They understand that your involvement has helped move towards a solution, even if parts of it could be misconstrued when seen from the outside."`
			`	You thank her for explaining. Now you definitely need to take the information to Giti. She may be able to use what you've found to predict what preparations should be made.`

			`Despite expectations, you are told to leave Giti on the ship, and a man who immediately identifies himself to you as Deputy Director Stephen Moray meets you at the entrance of the docking tube at the spaceport and gestures you into the private antechamber attached to each dock in the <origin> port. "I work for Syndicate Internal Affairs. We're the internal police of the Syndicate; when an employee of any rank does misdeeds, we track them down. Janitor or executive; it doesn't matter. My department of Internal Affairs works on piracy-related matters.`
			`	After you both sit, Stephen Moray turns on a device and places it on the table. "Communications jammer," he explains, "so we're not heard.`
			`	"I know that you have been working closely with the Hai lately, helping to achieve an outcome with lasting stability. I communicated with Remington and he's informed me that while it might appear to an observer that you've caused a mess, that the Hai representatives have now explained that previous stalling on their part was because some things needed to be known first. It would seem that, as per usual, there is as much going on behind the scenes as in front and you have become embroiled in it.`
			`	"I also understand what the Hai are grappling with right now," he says. "When I was a teenager, pirates kidnapped my brother and father, and forced them to serve on pirate vessels, calling them 'indentured servants.' My father watched helplessly as my brother's disabled ship was destroyed by a Navy Frigate just as it exited hyperspace. He eventually escaped - but he's now serving his seventeenth year of a twenty-five-year sentence for piracy, even though his deeds were against his will," Moray explains as he lays out a selection of reports to emphasize his point.`
			`	"I tell you this because it is important that you understand I am on your side in this. We have not met before, but we must trust one another. You see, the hails of the Navy: loyalty, honor, bravery - half-truths at best. We see the Navy as heroes because they are the only large organization capable of self-sacrifice. Yes, they do many good deeds, but those deeds blind us to their brutality and immorality. Not all humans are like that - many members of the Navy disagree with the barbaric rules about slavery. Some of us in the Syndicate, Free Worlds, and elsewhere, are trying to solve this problem.`
			`	"In my time as a Syndicate executive, I have arranged for over eighty thousand slaves to be smuggled away from pirate planets to gain their freedom in Syndicate space. I have extensive contacts within the slaver community. Now I understand you have found some things, that are also of historic interest to us. For this reason I am doubly invested; so now I need to know what you know."`

I also recommend having a ramscoop for safety. Investigate the systems and bring her back here, after that you'll have to go back to the Hai without her."`
			`	He pauses while getting ready to leave. "Oh, and you should probably tell her about the Hai at this point. We don't know if she knows, but if she doesn't she needs to know the basics. The scanners will flag anything we can explicitly identify as Hai tech, so the time has come. Good luck."`

It is completely inhospitable and appears to have a huge network of caves and caverns with crystalline structures that are radiating... something. Whatever it is is messing with the scanner's attempts to identify it. I'd have to know more about this scanner's functions to guess what the interference is. There's deuterium though maybe denizens of this system siphon the deuterium to make hyperspace fuel? Doesn't seem very efficient, but the solar wind is thin here. There's some kind of gravitational anomaly though, or maybe its just some kind of interference lensing. It looks like the planet has about a thousand times the mass it should, but with gravity around Earth normal. That... can't be right."`
			`	She shakes it off and looks at you. "Whatever it is we're looking for its not down there. Let me look at the moon... hmmm... okay. It's just an ordinary chunk of rock, but the planet's radiation is disturbing the sensors. I can only see a few dozen meters below ground even though the scanner should be able to look down at least ten times that far... Ahah!"`
			`	"I found something. There's a facility buried in the moon's surface. There is definitely a lot of Hai tech too, so looks like the concerns you told me about were spot on. I can only see the uppermost part of the facility but it appears to be divided into two parts. One section has hydroponics, big cargo bays, docking bays for ships, even a small shipyard. Doesn't look like they have space for more than a handful of large ships though. It also seems to have the only decently sized air processor I can identify. The other section is deeper, and appears to have spacious living areas I can see some support systems, but it seems that the air supply is effectively controlled from the surface access section. I can detect 1,387 people, though no details about them, and that's just in the upper three floors that I can see."`

			`	There is a pregnant pause for a moment and then she suddenly gasps. "Captain, this must be Elenchus!"`

			`When you return to <origin> to tell Teeneep what you have found, she seems to already know much of what you have to say. She draws you into a meeting room with Sayari who seems anxious.`
			`<A report from Moray has already arrived via Remington confirming the existence of the place. He would've let you explain, but they identified two staging areas that required immediate reporting.>`
			`	Remington looks at you. "I know its rough when news travels ahead of you, but Moray's team identified two bases which act as holding facilities in human space for the previously unidentified group that you've been investigating. That's where it seems the largest number of kidnapped Hai have been taken for processing before being taken to this mysterious 'Elenchus' place you've found. One of the bases is on Deadman's Cove, and arrangements are already being made to deal with it, but the other one is right here on Stormhold. In fact it narrowed down our remaining search here to a single target in one area up in the north. It should take us no more than a few days to pinpoint it, and a few days more to plan and execute an action against it." He shrugs. "The information was just too important to delay it for your arrival."`
			`<There is then a very big meeting, with Teeneep, Sayari, Choot'k, Alondo, Remington, Xilin, Adurath Khaine (who is introduced and explained for the first time), and Danforth. Terry's absence is lightly remarked upon.>`
			
			#rework
			`	Marshal Kaine introduces himself. "I'm the Marshal of the Third Armada, the guards of the Far North and the uninhabited regions near it. I know you've met one of my admirals, Danforth that is, a good man - albeit one who flouts the rules a bit too much." He gives a stern look at Captain Wallace. "Some of my carriers have detected the signals you've found. Actually, we see them quite regularly in the ships of known slave runners. The runners don't always carry slaves; they do other smuggling missions as well."`
			`	Agent Kopkow speaks his piece next. "Sometimes the runners do carry slaves, and we have found humans or Hai in crashed slaver ships. We returned the Hai to their homes, as you did, but they didn't know Republic Intelligence helped them. Several merchants have done the same. About one in seven we rescued were researchers, which is an extremely disproportionate amount when you consider the number of researchers in human and Hai space. Clearly, they're being targeted."`
			`	Kaine continues, "That, unfortunately, is where we have some bad news. Parliament has a strict policy on pirates and slaver ships: destroy on sight. This is a tradition that goes back long before the era of space travel. Raiding pirate ships is a deadly affair; numerous Navy or police will be killed. While it may seem heroic, the casualty rate is unsustainable. The only effective way to discourage piracy is to destroy the ships. If you don't believe me, try catching some yourself and count your dead."`
			`	Captain Wallace concludes, "That means many slaves are killed, including some Hai researchers."`
			`	Kaine says, "We informed the Hai government while you were away, and they've responded by moving fleets towards the wormhole; we're doing the same. By the time you arrive, there will be large fleets on both sides of the wormhole. This could quickly lead to war. Please take the message back to Teeneep and the Hai victims with our condolences. Captain, please see <first> <last> back to the <ship>."`
			
			`<The Hai have decided that this organization is their primary concern, and have announced that, as long as the Republic is willing to negotiate on how they deal with smugglers in the future, resolving this one issue will be sufficient for them to move forward from this current crisis. Especially considering that the bulk of the *other* groups who appear to have been exploiting Hai seem to have also been on Stormhold, and so there have been serious inroads made into resolving the problem more broadly.>`
			`<However, now time is of the essence. This has gone on long enough that the popular opinion is that the Hai must obviously exist, even though there are no explicit voices saying as such. It has in fact almost become a joke; "The Navy are blockading the Hai to hide humanity from them, because the blockade isn't doing a good job of being inconspicuous." There have been memes of the Navy hiding their ships behind far too narrow light poles while they distract a squirrel with their headlights. Now it's a matter of being able to present good news.>`
			`<Reaching Elenchus though would seem to be a problem. Humanity doesn't have many jump drives, and can't or won't risk all of them to try and take a base which has surface defenses. The Hai do not have jump drives at all, though the Unfettered do.>`
			`<Additionally, the base on Elenchus appears to be a hardened target. It will need specialized and suitably equipped shock troops to be sure of taking it. The Syndicate have suitable shock troopers they can mobilize quickly, but no way of getting them there, and the Republic's suitable shock troops are largely pre-occupied either being needed here on Stormhold, or are at least a week away from being available. (which is too long).>`
			
			# float
			`	The Unfettered leader opens his mouth to speak, but Teeneep raises her hand to silence him and steps forward instead. Surprisingly, he stops without complaint.`
			`	"This is General Choot'k, supreme commander of the Unfettered Hai military."`
			`	Marshal Kaine responds, "Good to meet you."`
			
			`<They also need a way to deal with the surface turrets, and short of bringing overwhelming firepower there's only one ship available with the systems to be able to affect that without, again, being delayed beyond what's manageable. That is Teeneep's Centipede, that has electronic warfare systems installed that should be able to baffle the turrets long enough to deal with any spacehip defenders and land where the turrets will no longer matter.>`
			`<The solution therefore, is this: <last> escorts Danforth + Cruiser, Teeneep + Centipede, Choot'k + Shield Beetle and two of his closest captains, to Foundry where you'll meet up with Agent Kopkow and  - a decorated Navy captain (Parliamentary Medal of Valor recipient) who will be bringing her Auxiliary, and one Free World Dreadnought that Alondo made sure was stationed nearby after his experience being briefly trapped on Hai-home. There you'll load up the Syndicate shock troops and go to Elenchus to resolve this. One crack team of people from all over working together.>`

			`	"I can vouch for the skill of our people, but not the pirates," Kaine replies, smiling.`
			`	Choot'k addresses the group. "The designs of the facility show a weak point in one of the hangars that we specifically should be able to exploit. My flagship has weapons pillaged from another species, which are strong enough to cut open the hangar doors yet precise enough not to destroy the hangar."`
			
			`<Choot'k's two trusted captains have been exploring the value of human weapons while they've been here, and think they have some winning combinations they would like to test in battle. This is why he has chosen them - also, the fewer alien weapons they drag through human space the better.>`

			`You arrive on Foundry to a little-used spaceport which usually sees only private, Syndicate executive vessels. Kopkow gives you a mildly apologetic smile as he greets you for the second time, and introduces you to Captain Anna Wallace. She expresses her satisfaction that some serious efforts are being made to stem the plague of slavery that pirate factions get away with. Apparently many officers like her disagree with the Navy's standard non-boarding policy. They want to rescue slaves whenever possible, regardless of risk or orders.`
			`	At the present moment he seems very stressed though. "It's becoming increasingly difficult to cover up the existence of the Hai," he explains. "The captains at Ultima Thule already know about the Hai, but we had to tell the crews that we were dealing with a major pirate threat. We hired a few pirate gangs to fly through the area to back our story. The Shield Beetles you've just flown here have been explained away as experimental ship designs from the movie production being tested out. Still though, our cover stories have passed the point of plausibility into the realm of barefaced lying. I hope you can finish this without too many more public displays, otherwise we won't be able to hide the Hai anymore.`
			`	"I've organized the Syndicate's 'hostile urban insertion security operatives' to be loaded onto the Auxiliary. They look like intelligence operatives, if you ask me, so that'll be a conversation for me to follow up on later, but for now they're specially trained for attacking pirate strongholds and equipped with state of the art equipment that... is on a need-to-know basis. As long as we can protect the Auxiliary we'll be fine. The intel you brought back doesn't suggest particularly strong resistance.`
			
			`	Before you all leave for the invasion operation, General Choot'k meets you as you're making final preparations. "You have handled yourself well throughout this. I want to see you prove yourself in battle before I open the entrance to <destination>. When we arrive at Devil-Hide, we'll first fight the defense fleet waiting for us. I suspect we can handle it, but you are of course welcome to assist. The main priority for you should be to make sure nobody pursues Elder Teeneep or Captain Wallace. However, they will likely keep a couple of ships in reserve. The scans you took suggest some are not totally fighting fit, or perhaps will be kept to use their weapons inside the spaceport as a backup defense. To counter this, you'll need to draw them out by demanding tribute from the city. They'll keep sending defense fleets until they resign to their fate and pay you daily tribute. We won't help you fight the tribute defense fleets, but we'll fight the pirates waiting for our arrival and any other pirates that show up."`

Humans, Hai, and even Korath live peacefully, working side-by-side, and most have no desire to leave. They value their independence and have refused Republic membership. This city orbits a strange world that defies analysis in a region of space untouched by civilization.`

		conversation
			`General Choot'k cuts open the doors of a large hangar, and your ships land. The two hundred operatives pour out, wearing exoskeletons with high density armor plating. As they storm through the complex, you follow some of them. Their guns melt away meter-thick walls in seconds, and on the ground most of their opposition does not have environmental protection against the knockout gas bombs they're equipped with. The pirates outnumber the Syndicate's operatives two dozen to one, but this huge advantage in equipment, combined with training and discipline, gives the operatives an almost overwhelming advantage in constrained spaces.`
			`	The squads move room to room, neutralizing all opposition with relative ease until their opponents switch tactics. The pirates begin using electromagnetic pulse devices to shut down the suits (and all other electronics nearby), leaving the targeted operatives helpless for up to ten seconds. Here some of General Choot'k's Unfettered show their strength, darting between operatives and bounding off walls with pulse rifles and long knives. They strike rapidly and withdraw as the operatives suits re-engage, preventing the pirates from coordinating an opportunistic counter-assault.`
			`	After a bloody struggle, forty-three surviving operatives win the fight, clearing the way to a large blast door. Only a couple dozen operatives are critically or fatally wounded, but the pirates were very good at booby trapping things or utilizing dormant machinery to pin, crush, or disable operatives or their suits. A great many of them will be spending time in a hospital. The Unfettered fared comparatively better, having mostly acted as reserve and flanking forces; still, over a dozen of them will be taking their own tails home as trophies after a few groups of pirates used miner's cutting power-arm extensions to great effect.`
			`	Having worked through the spaceport and down the access tunnel to the settlement, the vast blast door that the force now stands before is twelve meters high and wide, and scanners show it to be six meters deep. It is designed to be closed from this side though, and has not been sealed very well against being reopened from this side. Before long it grinds part-way open, evidently sabotaged, and the operatives put on their goggles and pass through into the darkness of the next room.`
			`	You could be forgiven for hesitating to follow them, but General Choot'k appears beside you and places one strong paw on your shoulder. "Come, now we discover if our task is finished, or impossible. It is time for bravery." He guides you in after the operatives along with his own troops.`
			`	Scanners show the room to be a vast cavern, some sort of public space suitable for ten thousand people or more. It's pitch black when you enter, but as the last of you files in, a second blast door closes behind you. High lux roof lights snap on making the room as bright as day in the blink of an eye.`
			`	You see before you a couple hundred pirates, held captive by a large crowd of heavily-armed civilians - all of which are now hesitantly pointing guns at the operatives. It seems the citizens have arranged a violent rebellion to coincide with the Republic's attack. Three unarmed civilians wearing distinctive hooded robes walk towards the operatives: one Hai, one human, and to your surprise one lizard-like Korath. The leader of the Syndicate operatives exits her suit and approaches them.`
			`	The Hai speaks. "We are the leaders of the civilian government of Elenchus. Although we are grateful for your assistance in defeating our violent rulers, we will not accept your dominion either. We have heard of your civil war. Elenchus is an independent nation; and we intend to stay so unless you intend to force otherwise. I can, however, promise that unlike our overlords, we have no interest in anything other than peace, and we will send no military ships through the wormhole."`
			`	After several hours of discussion, during which agent Kopkow prepares the documents for the provisional recognition of the new "Elenctic Commune" with Admiral Danforth and Captain Wallace as witnesses, the wounded are actually attended to in the Elenctic hospital facilities, and most of the human operatives pack up their gear and return to the Auxiliary. Meanwhile Teeneep and Choot'k go to lengths to engage with the Hai here and discover what they would best like to do.`

				goto leave
			label korath
			`	The Korath leader begins speak, with the Hai translating. "Several generations ago, three of our raiding ships jumped into the Alcyone system. Numerous pirate vessels left Stormhold and disabled all of our ships. A large human ship boarded our flagship while us on the other two vessels listened over communicators. All we heard was screaming. The pirates used deadly gas - what you call 'nerve gas' - to kill the entire crew. The death is excruciatingly painful to Korath. Not wanting that fate, most of the raiders on the second and third Korath ships mutinied and then surrendered. We worked as slaves for the pirate gangs, but now we're here, safe, and free. We are not specialists or their descendants like the others here, but we help as we can.`
			`	"The pirates must defend this planet against a space-based lifeform that attacks in flocks. Our ships gave them a significant advantage. Fortunately, we have one more left defend against any threats." The Korath eyes the Republic operatives as he waits for the translator to catch up.`
			`	"I must ask you keep the presence of Korath here a secret. If the Archons or other Exiles hear of this place, they may attack to retrieve us, or the Exiles may simply pillage. We will remain here in hiding unless the Exiles finally learn to settle on their planet."`
				goto questions
			label "translation services"
			`	The Korath leader hisses and replies while the Hai translates. "No, we cannot. Few among the Korath know your language, and we must remain here in secret. Perhaps in time there will be a way, but not yet."`
				goto questions
			label "cadmium"
			`	The Korath leader looks to the Hai, who responds, "Is that how you were led back here?"`
			`	"Indirectly," you reply.`
			`	The Hai leader continues, "Fascinating, we always wondered if it would pique someone's attention! Our Korath friends here brought a ship with some remarkable technology they call a "Systems Core". None of the surviving Korath who got here had the knowledge to replicate it exactly, but they were asked to try and many of them seem to have an uncanny knack for engineering. With their help, we managed to build some of our own in a fashion. Being not quite right, they work, but they fuse irrevocably with the ship, and some flaw in their function causes cadmium particulate, which is shed by the system maintenance processes, into the air where it is recirculated and ignored by the system intended to filter it out, since it's part of it."`
			`	The human leader adds, "We worked out how to reduce that effect to safe levels, but kept that information to ourselves in the hope that it would draw some attention. It tended to make the pirates sick more often than anyone else, which also seemed to mean that more of their victims escaped."`
				goto questions
			label home
			`	The three leaders laugh. The Hai answers, "We are home. Most of us were born here, or have lived most of our adult lives here. This is a place of learning, where three races join as one to progress together. Even some of the more recent arrivals, several had few connections back in Hai space and have viewed this place as a grand new novelty. An adventure without compare. Some recent kidnapping victims wish to leave of course, and we will help you find them and send them home."`
			`	The Korath speaks next, and the Hai translates. "Where my people came from, everyone was starving, barely subsisting. We had to raid for supplies, or slave away in bleak factory stations. This is a much better place for us."`
			`	The human leader concludes, "Most of the humans in this city have been here for several generations. This has always been home to us."`
				goto questions
			label place
			`	"It must seem very strange to you," the human replies, "but I shall explain. This place was founded over a hundred twenty years ago by anarchists from the colony of Freedom. Their community had been working within the Syndicate for a long time, evolving into anarcho-syndicalists that worked to bring the Syndicate down from within. At some point they discovered this place after stealing a drive and other paraphernalia that were unearthed from a dig site during construction work on Foundry. With the Syndicate on its doorstep, and difficult access requirements, they saw the potential in this place, but needed more manpower to exploit it. To do this, they allied with less peaceful anarchists and pirates. Those less savory types kidnapped researchers and engineers, forcing them to expand the base, and devise new weapons or medicines, and who eventually inherited control here after the syndicalists were wiped out. Our city also has manufacturing facilities where we created goods the pirates could not easily build in human space, where their facilities are destroyed regularly.`
			`	"There have been various attempts to take the spaceport and the city by force or by money. Early on, there were attempts by Alpha groups, and then various illegal organizations who tracked this place down from rumors about their rivals. There was even someone from the Syndicate who came with his personal fleet. There are those who have controlled this place by controlling the spaceport and treating with us, and there are those who have tried to force their way in here and bend us to their will. None of them returned home from the latter attempts. Some used chemical or biological weapons, others sent ships. Many offered money or favors. Elenchus has always been an independent country, and with control of our own spaceport, perhaps we always will be.`
			`	"Now that the pirates are gone, us civilians may govern without fear, and for that you have our gratitude. As expendable upper regions of the spaceport have already been destroyed, we have little to fear from attack by space creatures in the short-term, and soon we'll have our shipyards and facilities at full capacity again, such that we may defend ourselves.`
			`	"We won't ever join the Republic or any other government beyond the wormhole, but you personally will always be welcome, along with those you trust, for what you have done today. Our research and manufacturing facilities are damaged now, but as they are repaired, we will make them available to you."`
				goto questions
			label do
			`	"We're scientists, engineers, philosophers, people of learning. Intergeneration traditions of knowledge and learning are strong here. There are laboratories and workshops throughout this city where people from all three races work together. We seek knowledge. Under the pirates, we were allowed this freedom, as they realized it was the most effective way to get results that helped them. Now that our most recent abusive masters are gone, our research will not be guided by their violent motives."`
			`	"Of course, this is also a city. People have lived here for several generations, multiplying fruitfully. We have had to carve out more and more of the moon. There is plenty of space left before our growth will have to stop."`
				goto questions
			label space
			`	"Very little. The pirates wouldn't let us leave the planet, and jump drives are precious to them. They cannot risk drives on science expeditions. Still, we have managed a few trips under different regimes."`
			`	"There is no evidence that any civilization has ever reached this region of space until us, and this system is not native to the others around it. It was flung from our galaxy millions of years ago, and is still traveling relatively fast. One day, far from now, this system will pass beyond even this loose collection of systems that it is now close to. There are also many space-faring indigenous creatures that live in gas giants, and sometimes venture beyond. Most are harmless, so long as you leave them alone. There are flocking apex predators who hunt anything that moves.`
			`	"The planet below is a mystery to us. It has a thousand times the mass it realistically should, and its gravitational field reads as such from a great distance. This tremendous gravitational field sustains the large asteroid belt. Despite its incredible mass, as you approach the surface, the field does not increase at anywhere near the rate that it should. Thus, when you stand upon it, the gravity is only similar to that of Earth. There are many forms of radiation and strange materials inside the planet's caves. We believe it is a relic from a forgotten past, but we have no idea what sort of relic it is. Perhaps, now that we are not developing pirate weapons, we can focus on exploration."`
				goto questions
			label leave
			`	There is just one matter which need to be addressed with the three representatives and you raise it with them. "Did we have all of the leaders of this group? Are they all accounted for?"`
			`	They consult with some of their people who have been scouring the spaceport, helping to account for both the living, and the dead on both sides. At length, just the human comes to you.`
			`	"Your question was wise, there is one unaccounted for. Before I tell you though I think perhaps you should know more than you do." They reach up and push back their hood, revealing a bald head, as they gesture to the city in general. To your surprise you realize for the first time that they are a woman, though that seems like it could be the least important part of their identity. "Many different overlords we have had, and always they have relied on recruits from the city for some capacities, and have rallied other lesser groups to their banner. As such, ever have their been factions. Some, kinder than others."`
			`	They look at you meaningfully. "There was a factional shift in progress here before you arrived. A little over a decade ago, for the first time in a century, an anarcho-syndicalist faction took over the control of the spaceport and reclaimed the mantle of our original founders who called themselves 'Base Principles'. While we as a city didn't particularly care, there were some who sympathized with them more than most. As overlords went they were, fair enough. After only a decade, and despite significantly greater access to resources than their predecessors, their control was already slipping. Deviants and extremists who lacked the capacity to subscribe to a nuanced view had supplanted most of their major players. If they did not succeed in their quest imminently, they were already doomed to be replaced. Still, they were nevertheless exploitative overlords, and we don't pity them... but their goals were more noble than most.`
			`	"I tell you all this because I suspect you must seek out this one leader who is unaccounted for, and you should do so with all the knowledge at your disposal. The one leader who is not here was the last major player from the new 'Base Principles'. I do not know where your loyalties lie, so I ask you do you wish to know?"`
			choice
				`	"I do not, but I must, out of duty."`
					goto knowduty
				`	"I wish to know, for the Hai."`
					goto knowhai
				`	"I wish to know, for the Syndicate."`
					goto knowsyndi
				`	"I wish to know, for the people."`
			`	They regard you thoughtfully. "You are well suited to the neutral ground. It is little wonder you are here as an agent of no single faction. That is appropriate then.`
				goto finished
			label knowhai
			`	They incline their head respectfully. "The Hai are perhaps the greatest valuers of truth among us. If they have set you to this, then they will be honored by your diligence.`
			label knowsyndi
			`	They focus on you closely. "The Syndicate is perhaps the most impressive machine ever wrought by man. It is worthy of both respect and fear, and will do to people as any machine does to the product of its design. Treat it as such and it will always do precisely what you expect it to; both good and bad.`
			label knowduty
			`	They lift their head and smile. "A promise made is a promise kept. If your word is your bond then it would not do for me to stand in its way.`
			label finished
			`	"The missing leader you seek is embedded within the Syndicate and is known by the name Terry Adrianopoulos."`
			choice
				`	(Be surprised.)`
					goto surprised
				`	(You suspected.)`
			`	Their words scratch an itch of suspicion that you didn't realize had been irritating you until now. They smirk knowingly. "I have merely confirmed that which you already guessed. Very well, I need say no more. This matter is yours to do with as you will." They leave you to ponder your course.`
				goto done
			label surprised
			`	Your face must have revealed your response, for they smile at you with subtle mirth. "I see you know of this person, and did not suspect. I think it is to you and you alone I shall impart this knowledge. Do with it as you will." They leave you to ponder your course.`
			label done
			`	As you return to your ship, Teeneep interrupts you. "I need you to escort me one last time, Captain <last>. I must return to <destination> to resolve things now that the threat is ended. You will be well-paid, of course."`
			`	Anticipating your next question, she says, "The ships of the Unfettered Hai will be escorted back with us since the Elenctics are convinced they are at no risk and still have a ship at their disposal. Some of those who come as crew on the Unfettered vessels have chosen to remain here and join the Elenctics. More than enough bunks have subsequently been freed to return those who have chosen to come home with us. Danforth will come with us, but the other human vessels will make their way home themselves. Now we must rejoin our people on <destination> and set about resolving this matter for good, finally."`
