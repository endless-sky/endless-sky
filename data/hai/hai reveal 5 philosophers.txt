It has not gone unnoticed that the Navy moved a large fleet into the uninhabited systems in the northern corridor between Syndicate space and the Far North. Now, it seems that blockades are going up in Rigel, Nihal, Mirfak & Zaurak using Navy or Syndicate security vessels depending on jurisdiction. The theories are flying thick and fast, but everyone seems to agree on one thing; there is some sort of major crisis happening.`

# The fact that you have to actively go to the spaceport to proc this mission is intentional. It allows the player to take a pause to reorganize themselves if they need to, B01 stays active as a reminder.
# The fight in this mission is very large, but it's also a complete roflstomp. The pirates are outnumbered 2-1, and out-gunned significantly worse than that.
# You as the player have one job: make sure everyone jumps in together, and don't die. During the first campaign it was really important the fights were all balanced for you to be able to tip the balance.
# THIS mission is designed to give you a spectacle. A little visual demonstration of what a real battle could potentially look and feel like with low stakes for you. It's a visual feast, not a challenge.

			`The Syndicate security captain in the spaceport is very easy to find. She hands you a pad with a secure validation sequence to confirm her briefing comes from the Navy, co-signed by Xilin.`
			`	She appears to have a posse of other captains with her who conveniently enforce a bubble of privacy around you just by taking up space. "So," she says. "The Republic has agreed to accompany the Hai to precisely one world. Combined intelligence indicates that <planet> is the most likely place for any kidnapped Hai to be, assuming they exist. The blockades that have gone up are to secure this area of space against the secret of this exercise... or at least try to.`

"Now, to bring you up to speed: At least two pirate groups there have been positively identified as being involved in smuggling or kidnappings in the past. <planet> is a fortress of anonymity and discretion, as well as being a literal fortress for many of those that live there. As such an agreed upon force of overwhelming numbers has been prepared at Mountaintop. The objective will be to overwhelm the defenders we're expecting to encounter, prevent any escapes, and occupy the planet while they ferret out all the groups intelligence has flagged.`
			`	"The Navy, Unfettered, and Hai fleets will travel from Mountaintop to meet you. We must fly with all haste directly to Sumar to meet them where you will act as the central coordination vessel. My security force here will follow you there, but until we get to Sumar don't worry yourself about waiting for us. We'll handle ourselves. Once we're all together in Sumar, it'll be your job to make sure everyone moves as one for each jump from there to <system>."`
			`	She lowers her voice even further, despite the privacy afforded the conversation already. "There will be two Navy Carrier groups, our full Syndicate Special Security Detachment, the Unfettered Expeditionary Fleet, and a full Hai Taskforce. I don't think I've ever heard of a fleet this large being in the one place, at least not since the Alpha Wars. This coordination role is not a joke. There's lots of scope for things to go wrong here.

			`While you join with the fleet that lands to occupy the spaceport a number of those involved in the assault descend to other areas of the planet, pursuing priority targets who revealed a little too much about their position in the attempted defense of <origin>. This leads to a significant wait until those are resolved and the port is secure before everyone needed can reconvene to discuss the next steps.`
			`	You eventually end up in the secured command area hastily set up in the spaceport as Choot'k and Danforth come in discussing the tactical minutiae of some location you're unfamiliar with. They are trailed by Batu, who looks to be doing his best to pay close attention, and eventually joined by Sayari and Teeneep. One of Danforth's lieutenants brings up the rear and closes the door behind you all.`
			`	"So," begins Danforth, "Stage one has been successful. However, it looks like we're going to be here a while. Stormhold is an absolute rabbit warren of hidden places. Even with the Hai's ships and resources on top of everything we've brought, it could take several days, or even weeks, to be satisfied that we've rooted things out sufficiently."`
			`	Batu clears his throat and Danforth glances at him before evidently remembering something discussed earlier. "I'm sorry Elder Teeneep. I must advise you that at this stage all hope of keeping the Hai a secret is probably lost now. Even if we could somehow convince all the factions here to keep the secret, that blockade has drawn enough attention that really all that remains is to try and make sure issues are resolved before it becomes irretrievably common knowledge.`
			`	"For now, all communication in and out of the area is blocked at the relay unless its to or from specific high-level Navy or Syndicate sources. Captain <last>, I'm afraid that also includes you. No communications in or out since we don't have the time or equipment to properly harden your systems against potential intrusion, but you do have the nearly exclusive freedom to leave and re-enter through the blockade. You're a pilot, not a ground combat troop operator, so I suspect that since we'll be here a while there'll be other things for you to do."`
			`	"General Choot'k, would you agree with the human's assessment of the effort required here?" asks Teeneep.`
			`	The Unfettered warlord does not even hesitate to respond, "Yes. Even with our superior capacities we will be here a while."`
			`	Danforth looks between them. "Perhaps, Elder, you and the Ambassador would find it more comfortable to return to Mountaintop? There will be little diplomacy here, and scarcely more safety, and it would seem to me that even with Batu here as the deputy minister's eyes on the ground, it would be easier to conduct your responsibilities directly."`
			`	Teeneep seems to bristle but Sayari smoothly cuts in. "You should not concern yourself with our comfort Admiral. It would not be seemly for the Elder to abandon the field while another leader remains." She looks pointedly at Choot'k. "You may have forgotten also but there are two heads of state, as you call them, in this room. It would also not be seemly for our ships to act in concert with the Unfettered without a proper diplomatic liaison here. And so I too have my place here. Things have happened very quickly of course, but my colleague Hiyamaharu will soon be arriving at Mountaintop to act as my counterpart there. I trust things are being attended to, but you might consider checking that your people are properly aware of that."`
			`	Danforth gives his lieutenant a 'follow that up' look and then looks around. "Right, well in that case, the other officers should all be here and we can review our plans for stage two in an hour. <last>, thank you for your recent efforts, but you won't be invited to that one. Meeting adjourned in favor of coffee."`
			`	On your way out Sayari catches you and suggests meeting aboard Teeneep's ship to discuss some things.`
			`	Once there she pulls up a range of information on known or possible smuggling operations that they, the Republic, and Syndicate had reconciled for justifying this move on <origin>. Her focus though, is on what they hadn't reconciled. "So, unfortunately, while many matches were found - which led to this occupation of Stormhold - there was nothing in the new data sets which was able to be conclusively linked to anything associated with the mysterious symbol. And no human escapees had ever been tested for mild cadmium poisoning, so that was a dead end too. I know it's been thrust into the background pretty heavily, but did you find anything yourself? We need to decide if we're setting this aside or not."`

At this point if it proves to be a fruitless search then so be it, but I insist on having no loose ends we haven't tried our best to follow to conclusion. If you come back and that's the end, I'll bring Teeneep around."`

She's at her desk when she answers, and it occurs to you for the first time that a research console on a Navy grade connection probably has pretty good bandwidth. "Oh it's a relief to see you Captain. There's been so much going on, I feared you'd been caught up and detained with all that blockade stuff that all over the news right now.

Obviously if you're calling me back you want to know what I found about the notation. That too is something you have good timing on, I was delayed on that until just a couple days ago. Now where was that file... ah here it is.`
			`	"So, the notation is actually quite dense, and is mostly some probably meaningless prose about something called 'Elenchus'. It sound aspirational. However, it also refers to a secret gateway. I'm sending you some coordinates." You receive a simple text message a moment later with some system coordinates in it.`
			`	"What I've just send you is the modern standard presentation for a set of coordinates that were listed in the notation. Now it's possible there's some kind of code or cipher, in which case they'd be wrong, but if they are indeed just direct from the notation, then they indicate a system in the vicinity of Syndicate space that is not on the regular star maps. It must require a jump drive to access, but fortunately I know you happen to have one."`
			`	She shrugs. "Of course I have no idea how they'd have a jump drive, but that's not my problem. Whether you find something or not come back and see me. If that turns up bust I found an online community who seem to be a support group for people who've had family members kidnapped. The missing person reports for some of them are suspiciously close matches or share features with those in the files you left for me. Not sure if it'll reveal anything but we can look into it if you don't find anything. I haven't looked deeply though, it just came up yesterday while I was chasing down loose threads."`

Wait, you're with 'BookWyrm23'?!" He turns and steps into a pair of slip-on shoes while grabbing a jacket. "Let's go to my laboratory at once! I can show you."`
			choice
				`	"Sure." (Head to the laboratory.)`
					goto lab
				`	"A lead of a sort."`
					goto lead
				`	"Oh that's her handle?"`
			`	He blinks at you. "I mean, I assume you're with the librarian?"`
			`	"Research librarian," you clarify."`
			`	"Exactly, come on, lets go." He quickly leads the way back to the tube.`
				goto lab
			label lead
			`	You clarify that technically it's a lead on cases that match the same profile as his wife's, not strictly his wife's case. His expression falters momentarily and then he seems to find some internal resolve to draw upon. "Good enough for me... Thank you, for your honesty."`
			label lab
			`	After a short return trip, you reach what looks like a small private spaceport. From the extra equipment and unusual ship designs, you realize it must be one of Tarazed's research shipyards. Goraz's laboratory is an entire docking bay with a modified Blackbird. Despite its size, it is conspicuously absent any other personnel. He takes you on board and, noting your attention to your surroundings, explains that he has few assistants that are typically off-world most of the time as he walks you to the communications room.`
			`	"Here, let me take a look at what you've brought me." He takes the data stick you brought and plugs it into the communicator. After several minutes of mucking about with list formats and muttering incoherently to himself he pauses as a search result collates matches on his screen. You're not sure exactly what you're looking at, but when it finishes he lets out a long slow breath and comments to himself in a low voice. "Bastijn Biesterveld, you absolute legend. He was right - it's the interference."`
			`	He turns back to you and explains. "Normally interference isn't something that's logged, but when you're in civilized space with hyperspace relays, your ship does a final handshake with the local relay station as it jumps. That station sends that handshake signature to the destination station so it knows exactly who you are to be able to reconnect communications at the other end. It's a fully automatic process, and it's independent of ship IDs. It's just buried in there as a check from back in the days when hyperdrives would occasionally explode and we'd need to work out who went missing. It gets logged and automatically overwritten every couple days, and someone would probably have gotten rid of it if it wasn't so deeply baked into the way the system works. If you know when a ship jumped and where it jumped to, you can use it to confirm it didn't blow up; and if there's something wrong with the communications equipment you can use the log info to identify if a specific ship is the same ship talking to you later, but neither of those are particularly useful since the same information can be acquired more easily and in much higher quality through other means."`
			`	He pauses, realizing he's been rambling. "Sorry, that was probably way more explanation than you needed. There's a small group of us comms people that have lost people, or know people who have, that the authorities can't help. We're scattered all over and we've been looking at this ourselves. Together we identified some ships we thought were suspicious, but we've not been able to pin down anything concrete. Bastijn was convinced there was a pattern of interference signatures from the logs; he made the analysis program, but it was never definitively distinct from the noise. This data set you've brought though, well, once you filter for the subset of ships in our data set, what you've given me matches so completely to the set of ships we've found with interference that it has to be a match! Ninety-eight point five percent confidence interval completely annihilates the idea that it could be random."`
			`	He casts around for a moment and then plugs a freshly unpacked data card into his console. "Give me a little time: I can do something for you now. I'll be back with you in ten minutes."`
			choice
				`	(Sit down.)`
				`	(Stand around idly.)`
			`	After some time, in which he looks like he's installing a series of programs, he returns your original data card and the second one, now loaded up with whatever he was putting on it. "Load this new card into one of your communicator's extra data storage slots, preferably the first one. This new card will run maintenance level processes with the communicator to download the logs from the local relay when you enter a system, match the log signatures for ships that are in-system, and code up extra info for their ID's. Functionally, they'll show up as 'Smuggler' on your display. You'll have to hunt for them though, cause you'll have to be in the same system as them for any of this to work.`
			`	"Also... maybe keep this quiet. This is," he pauses and clears his throat conspicuously, "somewhat less than strictly legal, though there's no penalty attached to accessing the data at the level this card will use. My data sets only only cover coreward parts of Syndicate space, but your other data is heavily weighted to the Far North. Maybe if you have no luck in Syndicate space it'll be worth the trip to try up there."`
			`	All business and technical explanation now out of the way, you watch as the reality of what's happening seems to suddenly sink in, and his demeanor changes suddenly as his eyes shine with faint hope, "And please, if you do find my wife Janitza... please bring her home."`
			choice
				`	(Return to your ship.)`
			`	After one last ride through the metro system of <origin>, you arrive at your ship. You plug the data card into your computer, and a new "government" shows up: Smuggler. The ships will be colored differently than pirates.`
			`	It may be risky, but you should disable one and board it.`

There is no response, but once you dock and open your side of the airlock, the door to the smuggler ship <origin> also opens partway and a Hai pokes their head through. The Hai's eyes are wide with fear but also determination as they shout at you through the docking tube, "This door is jammed, they're locking down the ship and going to blow it up!"`

A moment later, you hear a very large explosion and the sound of tearing metal as the docking tube is shredded and your ship rocks as it is forced away from the expanding debris of the smuggler ship. When you return to the controls it seems the smugglers signaled for help before the ship exploded. An escape pod is rapidly escaping and pirate signatures are on a swift approach. Apparently the smugglers care more about not being caught than about finishing their mission.`

			`	Fortunately this makes it easy to find Sayari who has comparatively little to do at the moment and is mostly just helping to keep everyone communicating effectively. When you tell her of the system you found and the message from the Hai on the smuggler ship she winces. "What a terrible fate, but it does confirm what we suspected. We'll have to see what more we can find out in the meantime while we're still bogged down here."`

I fear it has lured some Hai into thinking they're trustworthy when they were clearly not. Perhaps there is more though. We have folktales of these stones making travel between the stars easier, and our space once extended to this region where the wormhole is. It is possible there may be a relation."`

Please, continue your investigation, talk to whoever you need to talk to, and don't go unprepared. This may be key to a peaceful resolution at the end of all this."`

Her expression is very serious. "We have not told them absolutely every detail, but we have made it clear to your diplomats that the issue was a matter which would have blocked any solution until it was resolved, regardless of if you helped or not. They understand that your involvement has helped move towards a solution, even if parts of it could be misconstrued when seen from the outside."`

It would seem that, as per usual, there is as much going on behind the scenes as in front and you have become embroiled in it.`
			`	"I also understand what the Hai are grappling with right now," he says. "When I was a teenager, pirates kidnapped my brother and father, and forced them to serve on pirate vessels, calling them 'indentured servants.' My father watched helplessly as my brother's disabled ship was destroyed by a Navy Frigate just as it exited hyperspace. He eventually escaped - but he's now serving his seventeenth year of a twenty-five-year sentence for piracy, even though his deeds were against his will," Moray explains as he lays out a selection of reports to emphasize his point.`
			`	"I tell you this because it is important that you understand I am on your side in this. We have not met before, but we must trust one another. You see, the hails of the Navy: loyalty, honor, bravery - half-truths at best. We see the Navy as heroes because they are the only large organization capable of self-sacrifice. Yes, they do many good deeds, but those deeds blind us to their brutality and immorality. Not all humans are like that - many members of the Navy disagree with the barbaric rules about slavery. Some of us in the Syndicate, Free Worlds, and elsewhere, are trying to solve this problem.`

There's deuterium though maybe denizens of this system siphon the deuterium to make hyperspace fuel? Doesn't seem very efficient, but the solar wind is thin here. There's some kind of gravitational anomaly though, or maybe its just some kind of interference lensing. It looks like the planet has about a thousand times the mass it should, but with gravity around Earth normal. That... can't be right."`

It's just an ordinary chunk of rock, but the planet's radiation is disturbing the sensors. I can only see a few dozen meters below ground even though the scanner should be able to look down at least ten times that far... Ahah!"`

I can only see the uppermost part of the facility but it appears to be divided into two parts. One section has hydroponics, big cargo bays, docking bays for ships, even a small shipyard. Doesn't look like they have space for more than a handful of large ships though. It also seems to have the only decently sized air processor I can identify. The other section is deeper, and appears to have spacious living areas I can see some support systems, but it seems that the air supply is effectively controlled from the surface access section.

There you are led past a selection of Navy personnel on guard into a meeting room with several people, including yourself. Some appear to have just arrived but it appears that some had been here for a while, and to your surprise Alondo and Remington appear to have come in person.

As soon as you're in someone says, "We're all here," and Choot'k and Remington stand up from where they'd been looking at something intently.`

"I know its rough when news travels ahead of you, but Moray's team identified two bases which act as holding facilities in human space for the previously unidentified group that you've been investigating. That's where it seems the largest number of kidnapped Hai have been taken for processing before being taken to this mysterious 'Elenchus' place you've found. One of the bases is on Deadman's Cove, and arrangements are already being made to deal with it, but the other one is right here on Stormhold. In fact it narrowed down our remaining search here to a single target in one area up in the north. It should take us no more than a few days to pinpoint it, and a few days more to plan and execute an action against it." He shrugs. "The information was just too important to delay it for your arrival. That, and they decided they wanted me here personally since Terry appears to be busy off doing something else.`

			`	Remington clearly did not need to be introduced, but doing so gives him a disarming charm and you see for a moment some of the charisma that he must utilize as head of PR.`

I know you've met my admiral Danforth, and I'm here because occasionally the Navy needs a politician, and the politicians need someone from the service that understands politicians."`
			`	Batu jumps in. "The Marshal has been very effective in helping to develop some solutions with Hiyamaharu and has just arrived here to make sure everything is set in order."`
			`	Khaine continues, "While there is intel on some captured Hai in the North, we have worked out a program to address that side of things more subtly and with a lower risk to all parties involved. Raiding pirate ships is a deadly affair and their bases more so. While it may seem heroic, even with the help of the Hai the casualty rate is unsustainable. However, while they may be allowed to go by intact, we have much better tabs on slaver and smuggler ships in the north, so we have options that don't require the sort of thorough manhunt that's occurring here to be effective."`
			`	Sayari speaks up. "The Elders have accepted the proposed plans, but with this new information we have decided that this organization you've uncovered must still be dealt with directly. It is our main concern now. As long as the Republic remains willing to negotiate on how they deal with smugglers in the future, resolving this one issue will be sufficient for us to move forward. The overwhelming majority of the other groups who appear to have been exploiting Hai seem to have been here on <origin> and so we consider there to have been serious inroads made into resolving the problem more broadly."`
			`	Remington takes over again. "However, now time is of the essence. This has gone on long enough that the popular opinion is that the Hai must obviously exist, even though there are no explicit voices saying as such. It has in fact almost become a joke; the perception being that, 'The Navy are blockading the Hai to hide humanity from them, because the blockade isn't doing a good job of being inconspicuous.' There have been memes of the Navy hiding their ships behind far too narrow light poles while they distract a squirrel with their headlights. Now it's a matter of being able to present good news. Place a successful spin on things."`
			`	"Our problem," says Khaine. "Is Elenchus.`
			`	"Reaching Elenchus would seem to be a problem. Humanity doesn't have many jump drives, and the owners of them can't or won't risk all of them to try and take a base which has surface defenses. The Hai inform us that they do not have jump drives at all, though the Unfettered do. Additionally, the base on Elenchus appears to be a hardened target. It will need specialized and suitably equipped shock troops to be sure of taking it. In our assessment so far we have determined that the Syndicate have suitable troopers they can mobilize quickly, but no way of getting them there, and our suitable shock troops are largely pre-occupied either being needed here on <origin>, or are at least a week away from being available. We need a resolution sooner than that."`
			choice
				`	"Is it really so urgent?"`
				`	"What's the rush?"`
			`	Khaine sighs in a long-suffering sort of way and waves off a couple of people before they can say anything. "The thing about governments is that all crisis' are either to be solved, delayed, or weathered. This crisis cannot be delayed, and so they must choose to weather or resolve. There are enough representatives who feel that their positions are too fragile to weather it, and so they have pushed to resolve. The timeline is set by their perception of the urgency." He looks to the Hai. "And obviously, there are also those who value our historic relationship with the Hai and seek to resolve it for those reasons too. Those are only the first two reasons on a long list. At the end of the day, it's politics."`
			`	"That's why we need you Captain," says Danforth. "I need someone to watch my back."`
			`	"And why we also need the Unfettered," says Khaine, looking over to where the Hai leaders are.`
			`	The Unfettered leader opens his mouth to speak, but Teeneep raises her hand to silence him and steps forward instead. Surprisingly, he stops without complaint.`
			`	"This is General Choot'k, supreme commander of the Unfettered Hai military."`
			`	Marshal Kaine responds, "Good to meet you."`
			`	Choot'k nods but Teeneep continues. "We also need a way to deal with the surface turrets and, short of bringing overwhelming firepower which we do not have, there's only one ship available with the systems to be able to affect that within our timeline. That ship is my Centipede. I have installed electronic warfare systems on it to baffle pirate defenses when I was investigating this before. It is our assessment that I should be able to baffle the turrets long enough to deal with any spaceship defenders and land where the turrets will no longer matter." She looks to Choot'k. "The General has generously offered to loan a drive for my use."`
			`	Choot'k addresses the group. "The designs of the facility show a weak point in one of the hangars that we specifically should be able to exploit. My flagship has weapons pillaged from another species, which are strong enough to cut open the hangar doors yet precise enough not to destroy the hangar.`
			`	"I also have two trusted captains who have been exploring the value of human weapons while they've been here, and think they have some winning combinations they would like to test in battle. I have chosen them to make use of our remaining available drives, and out of consideration for you humans. It would seem that the fewer alien weapons we carry through your space the better."`
			`	"Which means," says Khaine, "We have all the pieces. The solution therefore, is this: <last> will escort Danforth's Cruiser, the Elder and her Centipede, the General and his Shield Beetle, and two of his closest captains to Foundry. There you'll meet up with Agent Kopkow and Captain Wallace - a decorated Navy captain who has a Parliamentary Medal of Valor for handling the rescue of slaves - who will be bringing her empty Auxiliary, and one Free World Dreadnought that the good Alondo here had the foresight to make sure was stationed nearby. There you'll load up the Syndicate troopers and go to Elenchus."`
			# One crack team of people from all over working together.
			# Alondo did this as a backup after his experience being briefly trapped on Hai-home.
			`	Khaine looks at you all with an odd expression and concludes, "As plans go, it's mental. But every one of you will be heroes if you can pull it off."`
			`	General Choot'k says, "I look forward to joining your people in combat. We haven't had a chance to fight with - or against - your species. I hope we won't be disappointed."`
			`	"I can vouch for the skill of our people, but not the pirates," Kaine replies, smiling.`
			`	Danforth turns to you, "So, Captain, to Foundry, when you're ready."`

			`You arrive on Foundry to a little-used spaceport which usually sees only private, Syndicate executive vessels. Kopkow gives you a mildly apologetic smile as he greets you for the second time, and introduces you to Captain Anna Wallace. She expresses her satisfaction that some serious efforts are being made to stem the plague of slavery that pirate factions get away with. Apparently many officers like her disagree with the Navy's standard non-boarding policy. They want to rescue slaves whenever possible, regardless of risk or orders.`
			`	Just Wallace speaking seems to make Kopkow nervous to move on though; in fact he appears very stressed at the present. "It's becoming increasingly difficult to cover up the existence of the Hai," he explains. "The captains at Ultima Thule already know about the Hai, but we had to tell the crews that we were dealing with a major pirate threat. We hired a few pirate gangs to fly through the area to back our story. The Shield Beetles you've just flown here have been explained away as experimental ship designs from the movie production being tested out. Still though, our cover stories have passed the point of plausibility into the realm of barefaced lying. I hope you can finish this without too many more public displays, otherwise we won't be able to hide the Hai anymore."`

			`	You explain how they're just trying to keep things going long enough to resolve this mission and it is like a load has been lifted off the man, though he takes it in stride fairly professionally..`
			`	"Of course, nobody tells me anything in a timely manner... Anyway, I've organized the Syndicate's 'hostile urban insertion security operatives' to be loaded onto the Auxiliary. They look like intelligence operatives, if you ask me, so that'll be a conversation for me to follow up on later, but for now they're specially trained for attacking pirate strongholds and equipped with state of the art equipment that... is on a need-to-know basis. As long as we can protect the Auxiliary we'll be fine. The intel you brought back doesn't suggest particularly strong resistance. Wallace, good luck."`
			`	The agent shakes his head and departs as everyone else assembles.`
			`	Before you all leave for the invasion operation, General Choot'k finds you making final preparations for launch. "You have handled yourself well throughout this. I want to see you prove yourself in battle before I open the entrance to <planet>. When we arrive at <planet>, we'll first fight the defense fleet waiting for us. I suspect we can handle it, but you are of course welcome to assist. The main priority for you should be to make sure nobody pursues Elder Teeneep or Captain Wallace. However, these scum will likely keep a couple of ships in reserve. The scans you took suggest some are not totally fighting fit, or perhaps will be kept to use their weapons inside the spaceport as a backup defense. To counter this, you'll need to draw them out by demanding tribute from the city. They'll keep sending defense fleets until they resign to their fate and pay you daily tribute. This is where we would like you to prove yourself. We won't help you fight the tribute defense fleets, but we'll fight the pirates waiting for our arrival and any other pirates that show up."`

			`General Choot'k cuts open the doors of a large hangar, and your ships land. The two hundred operatives pour out, wearing exoskeletons with high density armor plating. As they storm through the complex, you follow some of them. Their guns melt away meter-thick walls in seconds, and on the ground most of their opposition does not have environmental protection against the knockout gas bombs they're equipped with. The pirates outnumber the Syndicate's operatives two dozen to one, but this huge advantage in equipment, combined with training and discipline, gives the operatives an almost overwhelming advantage in constrained spaces.`
			`	The squads move room to room, neutralizing all opposition with relative ease until their opponents switch tactics. The pirates begin using electromagnetic pulse devices to shut down the suits (and all other electronics nearby), leaving the targeted operatives helpless for up to ten seconds. Here some of General Choot'k's Unfettered show their strength, darting between operatives and bounding off walls with pulse rifles and long knives. They strike rapidly and withdraw as the operatives suits re-engage, preventing the pirates from coordinating an opportunistic counter-assault.`
			`	After a bloody struggle, forty-three surviving operatives win the fight, clearing the way to a large blast door. Only a couple dozen operatives are critically or fatally wounded, but the pirates were very good at booby trapping things or utilizing dormant machinery to pin, crush, or disable operatives or their suits. A great many of them will be spending time in a hospital. The Unfettered fared comparatively better, having mostly acted as reserve and flanking forces; still, over a dozen of them will be taking their own tails home as trophies after a few groups of pirates used miner's cutting power-arm extensions to great effect.`
			`	Having worked through the spaceport and down the access tunnel to the settlement, the vast blast door that the force now stands before is twelve meters high and wide, and scanners show it to be six meters deep. It is designed to be closed from this side though, and has not been sealed very well against being reopened from this side. Before long it grinds part-way open, evidently sabotaged, and the operatives put on their goggles and pass through into the darkness of the next room.`
			`	You could be forgiven for hesitating to follow them, but General Choot'k appears beside you and places one strong paw on your shoulder. "Come, now we discover if our task is finished, or impossible. It is time for bravery." He guides you in after the operatives along with his own troops.`
			`	Scanners show the room to be a vast cavern, some sort of public space suitable for ten thousand people or more. It's pitch black when you enter, but as the last of you files in, a second blast door closes behind you. High lux roof lights snap on making the room as bright as day in the blink of an eye.`
			`	You see before you a couple hundred pirates, held captive by a large crowd of heavily-armed civilians - all of which are now hesitantly pointing guns at the operatives. It seems the citizens have arranged a violent rebellion to coincide with the Republic's attack. Three unarmed civilians wearing distinctive hooded robes walk towards the operatives: one Hai, one human, and to your surprise one lizard-like Korath. The leader of the Syndicate operatives exits her suit and approaches them.`
			`	The Hai speaks. "We are the leaders of the civilian government of Elenchus. Although we are grateful for your assistance in defeating our violent rulers, we will not accept your dominion either. We have heard of your civil war. Elenchus is an independent nation; and we intend to stay so unless you intend to force otherwise. I can, however, promise that unlike our overlords, we have no interest in anything other than peace, and we will send no military ships through the wormhole."`
			`	After several hours of discussion, during which agent Kopkow prepares the documents for the provisional recognition of the new "Elenctic Commune" with Admiral Danforth and Captain Wallace as witnesses, the wounded are actually attended to in the Elenctic hospital facilities, and most of the human operatives pack up their gear and return to the Auxiliary.

			`	The Korath leader begins speak, with the Hai translating. "Several generations ago, three of our raiding ships jumped into the Alcyone system. Numerous pirate vessels left Stormhold and disabled all of our ships. A large human ship boarded our flagship while us on the other two vessels listened over communicators. All we heard was screaming. The pirates used deadly gas - what you call 'nerve gas' - to kill the entire crew. The death is excruciatingly painful to Korath. Not wanting that fate, most of the raiders on the second and third Korath ships mutinied and then surrendered. We worked as slaves for the pirate gangs, but now we're here, safe, and free. We are not specialists or their descendants like the others here, but we help as we can.`
			`	"The pirates must defend this planet against a space-based lifeform that attacks in flocks. Our ships gave them a significant advantage. Fortunately, we have one more left defend against any threats." The Korath eyes the Republic operatives as he waits for the translator to catch up.`
			`	"I must ask you keep the presence of Korath here a secret. If the Archons or other Exiles hear of this place, they may attack to retrieve us, or the Exiles may simply pillage. We will remain here in hiding unless the Exiles finally learn to settle on their planet."`
				goto questions

				goto questions

			`	The Korath leader looks to the Hai, who responds, "Is that how you were led back here?"`
			`	"Indirectly," you reply.`
			`	The Hai leader continues, "Fascinating, we always wondered if it would pique someone's attention! Our Korath friends here brought a ship with some remarkable technology they call a "Systems Core". None of the surviving Korath who got here had the knowledge to replicate it exactly, but they were asked to try and many of them seem to have an uncanny knack for engineering. With their help, we managed to build some of our own in a fashion. Being not quite right, they work, but they fuse irrevocably with the ship, and some flaw in their function causes cadmium particulate, which is shed by the system maintenance processes, into the air where it is recirculated and ignored by the system intended to filter it out, since it's part of it."`
			`	The human leader adds, "We worked out how to reduce that effect to safe levels, but kept that information to ourselves in the hope that it would draw some attention. It tended to make the pirates sick more often than anyone else, which also seemed to mean that more of their victims escaped."`
				goto questions
			label home
			`	The three leaders laugh. The Hai answers, "We are home. Most of us were born here, or have lived most of our adult lives here. This is a place of learning, where three races join as one to progress together. Even some of the more recent arrivals, several had few connections back in Hai space and have viewed this place as a grand new novelty. An adventure without compare. Some recent kidnapping victims wish to leave of course, and we will help you find them and send them home."`
			`	The Korath speaks next, and the Hai translates. "Where my people came from, everyone was starving, barely subsisting. We had to raid for supplies, or slave away in bleak factory stations. This is a much better place for us."`
			`	The human leader concludes, "Most of the humans in this city have been here for several generations. This has always been home to us."`
				goto questions
			label place
			`	"It must seem very strange to you," the human replies, "but I shall explain. This place was founded over a hundred twenty years ago by anarchists from the colony of Freedom. Their community had been working within the Syndicate for a long time, evolving into anarcho-syndicalists that worked to bring the Syndicate down from within. At some point they discovered this place after stealing a drive and other paraphernalia that were unearthed from a dig site during construction work on Foundry. With the Syndicate on its doorstep, and difficult access requirements, they saw the potential in this place, but needed more manpower to exploit it. To do this, they allied with less peaceful anarchists and pirates. Those less savory types kidnapped researchers and engineers, forcing them to expand the base, and devise new weapons or medicines, and who eventually inherited control here after the syndicalists were wiped out. Our city also has manufacturing facilities where we created goods the pirates could not easily build in human space, where their facilities are destroyed regularly.`
			`	"There have been various attempts to take the spaceport and the city by force or by money. Early on, there were attempts by Alpha groups, and then various illegal organizations who tracked this place down from rumors about their rivals. There was even someone from the Syndicate who came with his personal fleet. There are those who have controlled this place by controlling the spaceport and treating with us, and there are those who have tried to force their way in here and bend us to their will. None of them returned home from the latter attempts. Some used chemical or biological weapons, others sent ships. Many offered money or favors. Elenchus has always been an independent country, and with control of our own spaceport, perhaps we always will be.`
			`	"Now that the pirates are gone, us civilians may govern without fear, and for that you have our gratitude. As expendable upper regions of the spaceport have already been destroyed, we have little to fear from attack by space creatures in the short-term, and soon we'll have our shipyards and facilities at full capacity again, such that we may defend ourselves.`
			`	"We won't ever join the Republic or any other government beyond the wormhole, but you personally will always be welcome, along with those you trust, for what you have done today. Our research and manufacturing facilities are damaged now, but as they are repaired, we will make them available to you."`

			`	"We're scientists, engineers, philosophers, people of learning. Intergeneration traditions of knowledge and learning are strong here. There are laboratories and workshops throughout this city where people from all three races work together. We seek knowledge. Under the pirates, we were allowed this freedom, as they realized it was the most effective way to get results that helped them. Now that our most recent abusive masters are gone, our research will not be guided by their violent motives."`
			`	"Of course, this is also a city. People have lived here for several generations, multiplying fruitfully. We have had to carve out more and more of the moon. There is plenty of space left before our growth will have to stop."`

It was flung from our galaxy millions of years ago, and is still traveling relatively fast. One day, far from now, this system will pass beyond even this loose collection of systems that it is now close to. There are also many space-faring indigenous creatures that live in gas giants, and sometimes venture beyond. Most are harmless, so long as you leave them alone. There are flocking apex predators who hunt anything that moves.`
			`	"The planet below is a mystery to us. It has a thousand times the mass it realistically should, and its gravitational field reads as such from a great distance. This tremendous gravitational field sustains the large asteroid belt. Despite its incredible mass, as you approach the surface, the field does not increase at anywhere near the rate that it should. Thus, when you stand upon it, the gravity is only similar to that of Earth. There are many forms of radiation and strange materials inside the planet's caves. We believe it is a relic from a forgotten past, but we have no idea what sort of relic it is. Perhaps, now that we are not developing pirate weapons, we can focus on exploration."`

			`	There is just one matter which need to be addressed with the three representatives and you raise it with them. "Did we have all of the leaders of this group? Are they all accounted for?"`
			`	They consult with some of their people who have been scouring the spaceport, helping to account for both the living, and the dead on both sides. At length, just the human comes to you.`
			`	"Your question was wise, there is one unaccounted for. Before I tell you though I think perhaps you should know more than you do." They reach up and push back their hood, revealing a bald head, as they gesture to the city in general. To your surprise you realize for the first time that they are a woman, though that seems like it could be the least important part of their identity. "Many different overlords we have had, and always they have relied on recruits from the city for some capacities, and have rallied other lesser groups to their banner. As such, ever have their been factions. Some, kinder than others."`
			`	They look at you meaningfully. "There was a factional shift in progress here before you arrived. A little over a decade ago, for the first time in a century, a new anarcho-syndicalist faction from Freedom took over the control of the spaceport and reclaimed the mantle of our original founders who called themselves 'Base Principles'. While we as a city didn't particularly care, there were some who sympathized with them more than most. As overlords went they were, fair enough. After only a decade, and despite significantly greater access to resources than their predecessors, their control was already slipping. Deviants and extremists who lacked the capacity to subscribe to a nuanced view had supplanted most of their major players. If they did not succeed in their quest imminently, they were already doomed to be replaced. Still, they were nevertheless exploitative overlords, and we don't pity them... but their goals were more noble than most.`
			`	"I tell you all this because I suspect you must seek out this one leader who is unaccounted for, and you should do so with all the knowledge at your disposal. The one leader who is not here was the last major player from the new 'Base Principles'. I do not know where your loyalties lie, so I ask you do you wish to know?"`

				goto finished

			`	They incline their head respectfully. "The Hai are perhaps the greatest valuers of truth among us. If they have set you to this, then they will be honored by your diligence.`
			label knowsyndi
			`	They focus on you closely. "The Syndicate is perhaps the most impressive machine ever wrought by man. It is worthy of both respect and fear, and will do to people as any machine does to the product of its design. Treat it as such and it will always do precisely what you expect it to; both good and bad.`

			`	They lift their head and smile. "A promise made is a promise kept. If your word is your bond then it would not do for me to stand in its way.`

				`	(You suspected.)`
			`	Their words scratch an itch of suspicion that you didn't realize had been irritating you until now. They smirk knowingly. "I have merely confirmed that which you already guessed. Very well, I need say no more. This matter is yours to do with as you will." They leave you to ponder your course.`
				goto done
			label surprised
			`	Your face must have revealed your response, for they smile at you with subtle mirth. "I see you know of this person, and did not suspect. I think it is to you and you alone I shall impart this knowledge. Do with it as you will." They leave you to ponder your course.`
			label done
			`	As you return to your ship, Teeneep interrupts you. "I need you to escort me one last time, Captain <last>. I must return to <planet> to resolve things now that the threat is ended. You will be well-paid, of course."`
			`	Anticipating your next question, she says, "The ships of the Unfettered Hai will be escorted back with us since the Elenctics are convinced they are at no risk and still have a ship at their disposal. Some of those who come as crew on the Unfettered vessels have chosen to remain here and join the Elenctics. More than enough bunks have subsequently been freed to return those who have chosen to come home with us. Danforth will come with us, but the other human vessels will make their way home themselves. Now we must rejoin our people on <planet> and set about resolving this matter for good, finally."`

			`Your arrival on <origin> is met with much fanfare. In your absence the remaining staging ground here was eventually found and purged, and an agreement of sorts has been made between the Republic authorities and the remaining major players here - or at least those whose lists of possible crimes aren't so long and well-evidenced as to be arrested for appearing. The hope is that after such a thorough purge, <origin> will manage to be less of a source of problems for a while, but the expectation is merely that people smuggling will no longer be an industry that is widely tolerated by the local powers that be.`
			`	The Unfettered are treated as heroes by both their comrades and the other Hai crews as they return to the fold. This causes some, like Remington and Alondo, to share some concerned looks among each other and have a number of surreptitious chats with Danforth and Marshal Khaine, but the distinction between the two groups remains pronounced throughout.`
			`	Once people have had a chance to get sorted Teeneep approaches you again. "There will be much work in the future, but for now it is time to return to <planet>. I have been too long away, and there are obligations to be discharged. I have returned the borrowed Jump Drive, so we should pick up the Deputy Minister from Mountaintop on the way."`
