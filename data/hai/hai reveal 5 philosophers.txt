			`Arriving on Sunracer, the entire port seems to be abuzz with the news. It has not gone unnoticed that the Navy moved a large fleet into the uninhabited systems in the northern corridor between Syndicate space and the Far North. Now, it seems that blockades are going up in Rigel, Nihal, Mirfak & Zaurak using Navy or Syndicate security vessels depending on jurisdiction. The theories are flying thick and fast, but everyone seems to agree on one thing; there is some sort of major crisis happening.`

# The fact that you have to actively go to the spaceport to proc this mission is intentional. It allows the player to take a pause to reorganize themselves if they need to, B01 stays active as a reminder.
# The fight in this mission is very large, but it's also a complete roflstomp. The pirates are outnumbered 2-1, and out-gunned significantly worse than that.
# You as the player have one job: make sure everyone jumps in together, and don't die. During the first campaign it was really important the fights were all balanced for you to be able to tip the balance.
# THIS mission is designed to give you a spectacle. A little visual demonstration of what a real battle could potentially look and feel like with low stakes for you. It's a visual feast, not a challenge.

	`	You've had some encounters with Republic Intelligence, but you know what everyone knows. They're the top police force of the Republic, dealing with high-profile civilian crimes that local authorities can't handle: murder investigations, interplanetary kidnappings, and the like.

			label lab
			`	After a short return trip, you reach what looks like a small private spaceport. From the extra equipment and unusual ship designs, it must be a Tarazed Corporation research shipyard. Goraz's laboratory is an entire docking bay with a modified Blackbird, but despite its size, it is conspicuously absent any other personnel. He takes you on board and, noting your attention to your surroundings, explains that he has a few assistants who are off-world most of the time.`

			choice
				`	"It's all in this data stick."`
				`	"I think this is what you've been looking for."`
			`	Goraz takes the data stick you brought and plugs it into the communicator. After several minutes of mucking about with list formats and muttering incoherently to himself, a search result collates matches on his screen and he pauses. You're not sure exactly what you're looking at, but when it finishes he lets out a long slow breath and comments to himself in a low voice. "Bastijn Biesterveld, you absolute legend. He was right - it's the interference."`
			`	He turns back to you and explains. "Normally interference isn't something that's logged, but when you're in civilized space with hyperspace relays, your ship does a final handshake with the local relay station as it jumps." He pauses briefly, maybe to see if you understand him.`
			`	You see a long technical explanation coming on.`
			choice
				`	"Skip the technical bits, please. Can you tell me what I need to do?"`
					goto skip
				`	"I've helped with hyperspace relays recently, and I can never get enough lectures about hyperspace network issues. Please don't spare any details."`
			`	He nods and begins his lecture. "The local relay station your ship contacts sends that handshake signature to the destination station so it knows exactly who you are to be able to reconnect communications at the other end. It's a fully automatic process, and it's independent of ship IDs. It's just buried in there as a check from back in the days when hyperdrives would occasionally explode and we'd need to work out who went missing. It gets logged and automatically overwritten every couple days, and someone would probably have gotten rid of it if it wasn't so deeply baked into the way the system works. If you know when a ship jumped and where it jumped to, you can use it to confirm it didn't blow up; and if there's something wrong with the communications equipment you can use the log info to identify if a specific ship is the same ship talking to you later, but neither of those are particularly useful since the same information can be acquired more easily and in much higher quality through other means.`
			`	"There's a small group of us comms geeks that have lost people, or know people who have, that the authorities can't help. We're scattered all over and we've been looking at this ourselves. Together we identified some ships we thought were suspicious, but we've not been able to pin down anything concrete. Bastijn was convinced there was a pattern of interference signatures from the logs; he made the analysis program, but it was never definitively distinct from the noise. This data set you've brought, though. Well, once you filter for the subset of ships in our data set, what you've given me matches so completely to the set of ships we've found with interference that it has to be a match! Ninety-eight point five percent confidence interval completely annihilates the idea that it could be random."`
				goto wait
			label skip
			`	Goraz pauses for a moment, struggling to lower the content to layman's terms. "There's some ships that don't show up right on comms, which only a few experts like me can spot. Some of it could be random noise, but that's unlikely. We can filter out the subset of ships in our dataset. Hold on..."`
			`	After a few moments of fiddling with terminals, he continues. "What you've given me matches so completely to the set of ships we've found with interference that it has to be a match! Ninety-eight point five percent confidence interval completely annihilates the idea that it could be random."`
			label wait
			`	He casts around for a moment and then plugs a freshly unpacked data card into his console. "Give me a little time: I can do something for you now. I'll be back with you in ten minutes."`
			choice
				`	"Take your time."`
				`	"I'll be here waiting."`
			`	After some time, in which he looks like he's installing a series of programs, he returns your original data card and the second one. "Load this new card into one of your communicator's extra data storage slots, preferably the first one. This new card will run maintenance level processes with the communicator to download the logs from the local relay when you enter a system, match the log signatures for ships that are in-system, and code up extra info for their ID's. Functionally, they'll show up as 'Smuggler' on your display. You'll have to hunt for them though, cause you'll have to be in the same system as them for any of this to work."`
			choice
				`	"That's some impressive work in such a short time."`
				`	"Thank you for the help."`
			`	He nods in response. "Also... maybe keep this quiet. This is," he pauses and clears his throat conspicuously, "somewhat less than strictly legal, though there's no penalty attached to accessing the data at the level this card will use. My data sets only cover coreward parts of Syndicate space, but your other data is heavily weighted to the Far North. Maybe if you have no luck in Syndicate space it'll be worth the trip to try up there."`
			`	All business and technical explanation now out of the way, you watch as the reality of what's happening seems to suddenly sink in, and his demeanor changes suddenly as his eyes shine with faint hope, "And please, if you do find my wife Janitza... please bring her home."`
			`	After one last ride through the metro system of <origin>, you arrive at your ship. You plug the data card into your computer, and a new "government" shows up: Smuggler. The ships will be colored differently than pirates.`
			`	It may be risky, but you should disable one and board it.`

One of the bases is on Deadman's Cove, and arrangements are already being made to deal with it, but the other one is right here on Stormhold.`

It will need specialized and suitably equipped shock troops to be sure of taking it. In our assessment so far we have determined that the Syndicate have suitable troopers they can mobilize quickly, but no way of getting them there, and our suitable shock troops are largely pre-occupied; either being needed here on <origin>, or are at least a week away from being available.

That ship is my Centipede. I had installed electronic warfare systems on it to baffle pirate defenses when I was investigating this before. It is our assessment that I should be able to baffle the turrets long enough to deal with any spaceship defenders, and land where the turrets will no longer matter." She looks to Choot'k. "The General has generously offered to loan a drive for my use."`
			`	Choot'k addresses the group. "The designs of the facility show a weak point in one of the hangars, which we can exploit. My flagship has advanced ionic weaponry, that combined with enough raw burst firepower will disable and get rid of the hangar door without destroying too much of the hangar itself.`

			`	General Choot'k says, "I look forward to joining your people in combat. We haven't had enough chances to fight with - or against - your species. I hope we won't be disappointed."`

Humans, Hai, and even Korath live peacefully, working side-by-side, and most have no desire to leave. They value their independence and have refused Republic membership. This city orbits a strange world that defies analysis in a region of space untouched by civilization.`

			`General Choot'k cuts open the doors of a large hangar, and your ships land. The two hundred Syndicate operatives pour out, wearing exoskeletons with high density armor plating and equipped with all manner of weapons and gadgetry. They storm through the complex and you follow in their wake. Their tools melt through security locks in seconds, and most of their opposition lacks protection against the suits' stun gas bombs. With pirates focusing their efforts on the imposing suits, the Unfettered make many attacks of opportunity, inflicting massive casualties. The pirates outnumber the attackers ten to one, but this huge advantage in equipment, training, and discipline gives the attackers an overwhelming advantage.`
			`	The squads move room to room, neutralizing all opposition with ease, until their opponents switch tactics. The pirates begin using electromagnetic pulse devices to shut down the Syndicate suits (and all other electronics nearby), leaving affected operatives helpless for ten long seconds. Here, some of General Choot'k's Unfettered show their strength, outmaneuvering the pirates long enough for the suits to recharge. They dart between operatives and bound off walls with Pulse Rifles and long knives. They strike rapidly and in an organized manner, before withdrawing as the operatives suits re-engage, preventing the pirates from coordinating a counter-assault.`
			`	After a bloody struggle, forty-three operatives reach the end of the fight, clearing the way to a blast door. Only a couple dozen operatives are known to be seriously wounded, but many have been missing since the pirates switched tactics and began using traps and machinery to pin, crush, or disable the operatives or their suits. The Unfettered fared comparatively better, as the pirates focused most attacks on the Syndicate operatives, letting the fast, maneuverable Hai pass through. Still, over a dozen of them will take their own tails home as trophies, after the pirates used a miner's cutting power-arm extensions to great effect.`
			`	The blast door that the force now stands before is twelve meters high and wide, and scanners show it to be six meters deep. It is designed to be closed from this side, though, and has not been sealed well against being reopened. Soon it grinds open but, evidently sabotaged, only part-way. Despite this attempt, the operatives put on their goggles and easily pass through into the darkness of the next room.`
			`	You could be forgiven for hesitating to follow them, but General Choot'k appears beside you and places one strong paw on your shoulder. "Come, now. We will discover if our task is finished or impossible. It is time for bravery." He guides you in after the operatives, along with his own troops.`

			`	It's pitch black when you enter, but scanners show the room is a vast cavern, some sort of public space suitable for ten thousand people or more. As the last of the troops file in, a second blast door closes behind you. High roof lights snap on making the room as bright as day in the blink of an eye.`
			`	You see before you scores of pirates, corralled and held captive by an equally large crowd of heavily-armed civilians - all of which are hesitantly pointing guns at the operatives. It seems the citizens arranged a violent rebellion to coincide with the Republic's attack. Three unarmed civilians wearing distinctive hooded robes walk towards the operatives: one Hai, one human, and to your surprise one lizard-like Korath. The leader of the Syndicate operatives exits her suit and approaches them.`
			`	The Hai speaks. "We are the leaders of the civilian government of Elenchus. Although we are grateful for your assistance in defeating our violent rulers, we will not accept your dominion either. We have heard of your civil war. Elenchus is an independent nation, and we intend to stay so unless you intend to force otherwise. I can, however, promise that unlike our overlords, we have no interest in anything other than peace. We will send no military ships through the wormhole.`
			`	After several hours of discussion, Agent Kopkow prepares the documents for the provisional recognition of the new "Elenctic Commune" with Admiral Danforth and Captain Wallace as witnesses. The wounded are finally attended to in the Elenctic hospital facilities, and most of the human operatives pack up their gear and return to the Auxiliary. Meanwhile, Teeneep and Choot'k go to lengths to engage with the Hai here and discover what they would best like to do.`

			`	The Korath leader speaks, with a thick, sibilant accent. "Several generations ago, three of our raiding ships jumped to the Alcyone system. Numerous pirate vessels left Stormhold and disabled our ships. A large human ship boarded our flagship, and used what you call 'nerve gas' to kill the entire crew. The death is excruciatingly painful to Korath. The pirates broadcast the footage over to us, so we could see the screaming. Not wanting that fate, most of the raiders on the other Korath ships surrendered. We worked as slaves for the pirate gangs, but now we're here, safe, and free. We are not specialists or their descendants like the others here, but we have other talents.`
			`	"The pirates must defend this planet against a space-based lifeform that attacks in flocks. Our ships gave them a significant advantage. Fortunately, we have one more left to defend against any threats." The Korath eyes the Syndicate operatives as he waits for the translator to catch up.`
			`	"I must ask you keep the presence of Korath here a secret. If the Archons or other Exiles hear of this place, they may attack to retrieve us, or the Exiles may simply pillage. We will remain here in hiding unless the Exiles finally learn to settle on their planet."`

			`	The Hai leader continues, "Fascinating, we always wondered if it would pique someone's attention! Our Korath friends have ships equipped with these remarkable "Systems Cores", which are apparently vital to all Korath ships. None of the surviving Korath had the knowledge to replicate it, but they were asked to try and many of them have an uncanny knack for engineering. With their help, we attempted to build some equivalents of our own. Being not quite right, they work, but they fuse irrevocably with the ship, and some flaw in their function causes cadmium particulate. The cadmium is shed by the system maintenance processes into the air, where it is recirculated, and ignored by the system intended to filter it out since it's a part of the system itself."`
			`	The human leader adds, "We worked out how to reduce that effect to safe levels, but kept that information to ourselves in the hope that it would draw some attention. It tended to make the pirates sick more often than anyone else, which also seemed to mean that more of their victims escaped."`

			`	The three leaders laugh, and the Hai answers. "We are home. Most of us were born here, or have lived most of our adult lives here. This is a place of learning, where three races join as one to progress together. Even several of the new arrivals had few connections back in Hai space and have viewed this place as a grand new novelty. An adventure without compare. Some recent kidnapping victims wish to leave, of course, and we will help you find them and send them home."`
			`	The Korath speaks next. "Where my people came from, everyone was starving, barely subsisting. We had to raid for supplies, or slave away in bleak factory stations. This is a much better place for us."`
			`	The human leader concludes, "Most of the humans in this city have been here for several generations. This has always been home to us."`

			`	"It must seem strange to you," the human replies, "but I shall explain. This place was founded over a hundred and twenty years ago by anarchists from the colony of Freedom. Their community had been working within the Syndicate for a long time, evolving into anarcho-syndicalists that worked to bring the Syndicate down from within. At some point they discovered this place after stealing a drive and other paraphernalia that were unearthed from a construction site on Foundry. With the Syndicate on its doorstep and difficult access requirements, they saw the potential in this place but needed more manpower to exploit it. To do this, they allied with less peaceful anarchists and pirates. Those less savory types kidnapped researchers and engineers, forcing them to expand the base and devise new weapons or medicines. They eventually inherited control here after the syndicalists were wiped out. Our city also has manufacturing facilities where we created goods the pirates could not easily build in human space, where their facilities are destroyed regularly.`
			`	"There have been various attempts to take the spaceport and the city by force or by money. Early on, there were attempts by Alpha groups, and then various illegal organizations who tracked this place down from rumors about their rivals. There was even someone from the Syndicate who came with his personal fleet. There are those who have controlled this place by controlling the spaceport and treating with us, and there are those who have tried to force their way in here and bend us to their will. None of them returned home from the latter attempts. Some used chemical or biological weapons, others sent ships. Many offered money or favors. Elenchus has always been an independent country, and with control of our own spaceport, perhaps we always will be.`
			`	"Now that the pirates are gone, us civilians may govern without fear, and for that you have our gratitude. As expendable upper regions of the spaceport have already been destroyed, we have little to fear from attack by space creatures in the short-term, and soon we'll have our shipyards and facilities at full capacity again, such that we may defend ourselves.`
			`	"We won't ever join the Republic or any other government beyond the wormhole, but you personally will always be welcome, along with those you trust, for what you have done today. Our research and manufacturing facilities are damaged now, but as they are repaired, we will make them available to you."`

This place is far from being a paradise, but it is a community that strives together. Under the pirates we were allowed this freedom, as they realized it was the most effective way to get results that helped them. Now that our most recent abusive masters are gone, we need not have our priorities guided by their violent motives."`
			`	"Of course, this is also a city. People have lived here for several generations, multiplying fruitfully. We have had to carve out more and more of the moon. There is plenty of space left before our growth will have to stop."`

			`	"There is no evidence that any civilization has ever reached this region of space until us, and this system is not native to the others around it. It was flung from our galaxy millions of years ago, and is still traveling relatively fast. One day, far from now, this system will pass beyond even this loose collection of systems that it is now close to. There are also many space-faring indigenous creatures that live in gas giants, and sometimes venture beyond. Most are harmless, so long as you leave them alone. There are flocking apex predators who hunt anything that moves.`
			`	"The planet below is a mystery to us. It has a thousand times the mass it realistically should, and its gravitational field reads as such from a great distance. This tremendous gravitational field sustains the large asteroid belt. Despite its incredible mass, as you approach the surface, the field does not increase at anywhere near the rate that it should. Thus, when you stand upon it, the gravity is only similar to that of Earth. There are many forms of radiation and strange materials inside the planet's caves. We believe it is a relic from a forgotten past, but we have no idea what sort of relic it is. Perhaps, now that we are not developing pirate weapons, we can focus on exploration."`

			`	There is one last critical matter to be addressed with the three representatives and you raise it with them. "Did we have all of the leaders of this group? Are they all accounted for?"`
			`	They consult with some of their people who have been scouring the spaceport, helping to account for both the living, and the dead on both sides. At length, just the human comes to you.`
			`	"Your question was wise. There is one unaccounted for. Before I tell you, though, I think perhaps you should know more than you do." They reach up and push back their hood, revealing a bald head, as they gesture to the city in general. To your surprise you realize for the first time that they are a woman, though that seems like it could be the least important part of their identity.`

			`	"Many different overlords we have had, and always they have relied on recruits from the city for some capacities while rallying other lesser groups to their banner. As such, ever have there been factions. Some, kinder than others."`
			`	They look at you meaningfully. "There was a factional shift in progress here before you arrived. A little over a decade ago, for the first time in a century, a new anarcho-syndicalist faction from Freedom took over the control of the spaceport and reclaimed the mantle of our original founders who called themselves 'Base Principles'. While we as a city didn't particularly care, there were some who sympathized with them more than most. As overlords went they were, fair enough. After only a decade, and despite significantly greater access to resources than their predecessors, their control was already slipping. Deviants and extremists who lacked the capacity to subscribe to a nuanced view had supplanted most of their major players. If they did not succeed in their quest imminently, they were already doomed to be replaced. Still, they were nevertheless exploitative overlords, and we don't pity them... but their goals were more noble than most.`
			`	"I tell you all this because I suspect you must seek out this one leader who is unaccounted for, and you should do so with all the knowledge at your disposal. The one leader who is not here was the last major player from the new 'Base Principles'. I do not know where your loyalties lie, so I ask you: why do you wish to know?"`

Some of those who came as crew on the Unfettered vessels have chosen to remain here and join the Elenctics.
