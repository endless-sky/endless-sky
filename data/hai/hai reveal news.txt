			"Studying this planet will accelerate human science by decades. Maybe centuries. I think the Pug may have done us more good than harm."
			"I used to think the Pug were evil after all they did, but look at the consequences of their actions. We're at peace, we allied together as a single species, and we have endless technology to study."

			"A ringworld is such a stupid idea. If you break clean through one piece, the centrifugal force tears the whole ring apart. If the Quarg were smart, they would've made a Dyson swarm instead."
