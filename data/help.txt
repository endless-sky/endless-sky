help "bank"
	`This is the bank. Here, you can apply for new mortgages, if your income and credit history allows it. The bank is also a good place to get an overview of your daily expenses: mortgage payments, crew salaries, etc.`
	`Paying off a mortgage early means you pay less interest to the bank, but it is sometimes wiser to instead use your money to buy a bigger ship which can earn you more income.`

help "basics 1"
	`Press <View star map> to bring up your map. Select a destination, then close the map and press <Initiate hyperspace jump> to jump. Press <Land on planet / station> to land.`

help "basics 2"
	`For the main menu, press <Show main menu>. The control key bindings can be viewed and changed in the preferences.`

help "dead"
	`Uh-oh! You just died. The universe can be a dangerous place for new captains!`
	`Fortunately, your game is automatically saved every time you leave a planet. To load your most recent saved game, press <Show main menu> to return to the main menu, then click on "Load / Save" and "Enter Ship."`

help "disabled"
	`Your ship just got disabled! Before an enemy ship finishes you off, you should find someone to help you.`
	`Press <Select next ship> to cycle through all the ships in this system. When you have a friendly one selected, press <Talk to selected ship> to hail it. You can then ask for help, and the ship will come over and patch you up.`
	`If the ship that disabled you is still hanging around, you might need to hail them first and bribe them to leave you alone.`

help "hiring"
	`Hiring extra crew is only helpful if you plan on capturing enemy ships. Each crew member other than yourself is paid 100 credits per day. Larger ships require more than one crew member, but you will automatically hire the minimum number of crew when you buy those ships.`
	`Crew members take up space that can otherwise be used for passengers.`

help "jobs"
	`Taking on jobs is a safe way to earn money. Special missions are offered in the Spaceport; more mundane jobs are posted on the Job Board. Most special missions are only offered once: if you turn one down, it will not be offered to you again.`
	`The payment for a job depends on how far you must travel and how much you are carrying. Jobs that have a time limit pay extra, but you are paid nothing if you miss the deadline.`
	`As you gain a combat reputation, new jobs will become available, including escorting convoys and bounty hunting.`

help "multiple ships"
	`Now that you have more than one ship, while landed on a planet you can reorder the ships in your fleet by clicking and dragging them in the shipyard, outfitter, or player info panel. You will use the first ship in the list as your flagship, unless it is a fighter or an unpiloted drone. In the player info panel you can also "park" a ship on a planet if you want to travel somewhere without it coming with you.`

help "navigation"
	`Welcome to the sky! To travel to another star system, press <View star map> to view your map, and click on the system you want to travel to. Your hyperdrive can only travel along the "links" shown on your map. After selecting a destination, close your map and press <Initiate hyperspace jump> to jump to that system.`
	`Your ship does not jump until you release the jump key. Once you have escorts, you can hold the key to get them ready to jump, then release it to have them all jump simultaneously.`
	`When you reach a new system, you can press <Land on planet / station> to land on any inhabited planets that are there.`
	`Also, don't worry about crashing into asteroids or other ships; your ship will fly safely below or above them.`

help "outfitter"
	`Here, you can buy new equipment for your ship. Your ship has a limited amount of "outfit space," and most outfits use up some of that space.`
	`Some types of outfits have other requirements as well. For example, only some of your outfit space can be used for engines or weapons; this is your ship's "engine capacity" and "weapon capacity." Guns and missile launchers also require a free "gun port," and turrets require a free "turret mount." Also, missiles can only be bought if you have the right launcher installed.`
	`Use your scroll wheel, or click and drag, to scroll the view.`
	`As in the trading panel, you can hold down Shift or Control to buy 5 or 20 of an outfit at once, or both keys to buy 100.`

help "stranded"
	`Oops! You just ran out of fuel in an uninhabited star system. Fortunately, other ships are willing to help you.`
	`Press <Select next ship> to cycle through all the ships in this system. When you have a friendly one selected, press <Talk to selected ship> to hail it. You can then ask for help, and if it has fuel to spare it will fly over and transfer fuel to your ship. This is easiest for the other ship to do if your ship is nearly stationary.`

help "trading"
	`This is the trading panel. Earn money by buying commodities at a low price in one system, and selling at a higher price elsewhere. To view your map of commodity prices in other systems, press <View star map>. To buy or sell, click on [buy] or [sell], or select a line with the up and down arrows and press "+" or "-" (or Enter and Delete).`
	`You can buy 5 tons at once by holding down Shift, 20 by holding down Control, or 100 at a time by holding down both.`
