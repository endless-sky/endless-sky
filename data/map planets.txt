Outside of the cities, which are clustered around the equator, Ablub's Invention is uninhabited except by the native lifeforms, including strange, spindly-legged quadrupeds, awkward birds with leathery wings, and amphibians with webbed feet and long, whiskered snouts.`
	spaceport `The day-night cycle here is at least three times as long as any of the Coalition's species are habituated to, so the entire city enters a "false nighttime" in the middle of the day, shuttering all the windows so that the locals can rest and reset their biological clocks. And in the middle of the night, the city is brightly lit for a "false day."`
	spaceport `	The local work schedule has adapted to this unusual cycle, with the two true daytime periods serving the equivalent of the human work week, and the false daytime treated as a weekend, a time for socializing or working at home.`

The ice moon may have been captured by Aetuah in times past as a rogue planet, and the distance of the gas giant from the system center suggests it might be a rogue planet itself as well. In time, the gravitational force exhibited by Aetuah will tear apart the ice moon, plummeting it into the abyss.`
	description `	The most striking features of Aetuah are large oval-shaped organisms inhabiting the upper atmosphere. These lifeforms resemble some of the space fauna of nearby systems, and have a strange behavior of slingshotting themselves away from Aetuah once they reach a certain size through some unknown propulsion method.`

What is not commonplace is the presence of almost perfectly pyramidal piles of regolith scattered across the world. Querying an orbiting Remnant satellite suggests that these are believed to have been remote mining sites for mineral processing.`

The next settlers were pirates who believed that a planet free from laws and constraints would be a great base of operations.`

The pirate bases, having a much more ready source of supplies, are located wherever there are flat landing areas close to craggy, defensible mountains.`

	description `	Most of the inhabitants live deep underground to avoid the hot sunlight and frequent sandstorms. It is a dangerous life; cave-ins are common in the mines, and the sand on the surface can shift so suddenly that it is not uncommon for one of the underground villages to find its surface entrance buried, and to need to call for help from another village. But the mines operate with a joint ownership model where all the workers profit equally, so working here pays well. Many of the miners stay here only for five or ten years, while sending money back to their families off-world.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is an enormous concrete tower rising a hundred meters above the sand, with the intention that it should be high enough to avoid being buried in even the largest of sandstorms. Each pad has landing clamps to secure your ship in case of high winds. Even so, you are a bit nervous as you leave your ship behind and board one of the cargo elevators to the complex below.`

The skies here are frequently blanketed in a volcanic haze. This world is rich in oil deposits, a relic of a past when more life flourished here, but drilling for oil is costly because the shifting ground can damage drills or seal up previously productive bore-holes. Since this also makes processing difficult, the oil is exported off-world for processing into plastics, instead of having the manufacturing performed locally.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is in a particularly dingy corner of Dusk Companion's largest city. The windows are caked with soot and grime, and the few plants that grow here have a thin layer of volcanic ash on their leaves. The thick clouds overhead cloak the city in a perpetual twilight, and the streetlights remain lit even at midday.`

	description `In human space, this system would probably have been left unsettled, because its sun produces too much ultraviolet radiation for animals to survive for long on its surface. But the Hai have instead turned this warm ocean world into a massive incubator for photosynthetic algae and bacteria. Each species is genetically engineered to produce one or more medical or nutritional compounds that they can make use of. Barges travel slowly through the oceans harvesting these microorganisms out of the water and separating out the chemical compounds they provide.`
	spaceport `The spaceport appears to have been built by expanding a natural set of caves in a cliff facing the ocean. At high tide the lower caves flood, allowing barges to dock and unload the compounds they have harvested. Tunnels lead deep into the rock to rooms that have been carved out as warehouse space and living quarters. The rock remains somewhat cool, even at midday, but the air is still oppressively humid.`

Centuries ago, because of its remoteness, this world was the site of some illegal genetic experiments, and rumors say that the current inhabitants are the result of those experiments. Because they are so well adapted to low gravity, few of them choose to leave, and very few outsiders choose to settle here, so this world's culture remains quite insular and detached from the rest of the galaxy.`
	spaceport `Although this is a human planet, as you walk through this spaceport you feel as if you are on an alien world. The ceilings and doorways are all a bit higher than you are used to, and the locals tower over you. Aside from a few food carts in the marketplace, there are no shops or restaurants in the spaceport, and the nearest village is several kilometers away. It is as if the entire port was designed in order to limit interactions with outsiders to the bare minimum that is necessary.`

In addition to harvesting deuterium, this is one of the few refinery stations in human space which also collects helium-3, an isotope with some exotic uses in medical imaging and in energy research.`
	description `	The diversity of isotopes found here is partly due to the station being a relatively new construction and benefiting from modern technology. But the gas giant which the station harvests from also has a composition unlike any other known planet. One theory is that it is on the cusp of becoming a brown dwarf star, in which case the isotopes now being stirred into the upper atmosphere by convection will eventually be depleted by fusion.`
	spaceport `This station is composed of two rings, one containing the refinery and the other, the living quarters and cafeteria for the workers, in addition to a docking bay for visiting freighters. The workers all seem to be very busy, and few of them pay any attention to you.`

The average adult Quarg is over three meters tall, and although they move slowly and gracefully, on their long legs they easily speed by you. Worse, the counters for the merchant exchange, bank, and job board are high enough that you can barely see over them.

However, given that some explosive eruptions here have been known to launch lava nearly a kilometer into the air, sooner or later Fourth Port will need to be replaced by a fifth.`

As a result, the population is still quite low here, and the locals live isolated lives, with most families living many kilometers away from the nearest school or hospital or even from their nearest neighbor.`
	description `	Cattle handlers here do their work on horseback, because they believe modern vehicles are more likely to spook the animals.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is on the outskirts of one of New Argentina's largest towns... which has a population of barely ten thousand people. Many of the dock workers are teenagers or barely past their teens, children of ranchers who are not drawn to the solitary sort of life that their parents enjoy. Aside from the church and the hospital, the largest building in town is "The Grange," a function hall with a sign out front advertising square dances and line dances three nights a week.`

A small fleet of tanker ships is docked on specially marked hangar bays, always ready to bring the fuel elsewhere if needed.`
	description `	"Ogmur" is the name of the gas giant below, named after a giant snake-like creature of Arach mythology. With an abnormally dense core and storms more ruthless than in any other gas giants in the Coalition, it swallowed the first five predecessors of this station before they could be completed, and though this one has remained in a stable orbit for thousands of years after its completion, superstition surrounding the planet makes it so that the Siphon receives very few visitors.`
	spaceport `While technically part of the system's "Guardian" military complex, there's little to no Heliarch control over the free space in this station, so a few shops and branded restaurants have opened up to serve the local workers and occasional visitors. Whether by necessity due to the lack of services in the system, or simply out of boredom within the monotony of the station, the food here is by far the best in the system and even better than on some Coalition planets.`
	spaceport `	With the exclusive goal of serving as a large-scale refinery, the station has far less living space than the system's main attraction, often leading to semi-crowded areas in spite of the low amount of pedestrian traffic here.`

Much of the land is forests, with villages built entirely in the treetops.`
	description `	There are also farms here, but more like gardens or parks than a human farm: each with dozens of species of plants growing side by side, and harvested by autonomous robots.`
	spaceport `The streets in the Wanderer capital city seem to be mostly reserved for cargo vehicles; the Wanderers themselves fly from one building to another instead, and the skyscrapers have balconies dozens of stories above the ground where visitors can land or take off. The air traffic seems utterly chaotic, but somehow they avoid colliding with each other in midair, and certain columns of airspace have been reserved for ships taking off and landing so that flying Wanderers will not get caught in the backwash from the ship engines.`

Engines are attached to some of these floating villages, allowing them to be slowly propelled from one part of the planet's surface to another, and the only native industries are fishing and seaweed farming.`
	spaceport `The raft of algae that supports the spaceport is probably at least a dozen meters thick, but flexible enough that it bends as the ocean swells pass underneath, causing individual buildings to rise up or tilt slightly relative to their neighbors. The effect is subtle, but disconcerting, and you cannot help but stumble drunkenly at times as you explore the island.`

But aside from a few large warehouses at ground level, the village itself is entirely made of tree-houses. A few mechanical lifts have been built into the sides of the trees to carry cargo up to the forest canopy where the Wanderers live, but the Wanderers themselves seem content to fly between the houses rather than using the lifts.`

	description `	The surface of these red-purple lakes and rivers move in odd ways that make them seem almost alive. Although they flow at extremely low rates, they also softly bulge and contract in a curious linear motion.`

	music "ambient/rulei planet"
	description `Like its parent planet below, Yniu Ena has a thick purple-reddish web of unnatural material spread across its surface, forming rivers and large lakes. While most of these lakes are rather small relative to the planet's surface, there are a few as large as oceans that give the appearance of scars on the planet.`

planet Zenith
	attributes frontier north "north pirate" pirate
	landscape land/water4
	description `Zenith is a cold and unpleasant world, where the fog seldom lifts and the sun is rarely seen, where much of the lowlands are flooded each day by the tide, and storms are unpredictable and fierce. It has, however, one major advantage as a place to settle: it is far enough away that the Republic makes no attempt to control it.`
	description `	Several villages have been founded near the equator, and in addition there are an unknown number of private holdings, ranging from underground bunkers to enormous concrete fortresses. Because the land is owned by no government and anyone can build a dwelling without permission or paperwork as long as they are willing to fight off any other claimants, the total population of Zenith is unknown.`
	spaceport `To create a spaceport for Zenith, one enterprising privateer a few centuries ago used a mixture of explosives and heavy machinery to shift the top of one of the tallest mountains down into the neighboring valleys, creating a high plateau that is (usually) above the fog line. There are landing pads both for starships like yours and for airships that carry cargo to and from the settlements elsewhere on the planet. The port is nearly deserted, however; it is clear that they do not do much business here.`

planet Zug
	attributes factory farming rim
	landscape land/city4
	description `Zug is a pleasant world of rolling hills, fertile fields, and a few small oceans. Hundreds of millions of people live here, with more immigrants arriving every day, almost faster than the construction industry can keep up with them. In addition to the larger cities, many people live in smaller farming villages, making this one of the few worlds in the region that is truly self-sufficient both in industry and in agriculture.`
	description `	The largest industry on Zug is Southbound Shipyards, which focuses on designing well-defended merchant ships to survive the pirates that are so common here.`
	spaceport `The spaceport of Zug has been growing by amalgamation for centuries. At its core is the "Old Port," a set of quaint and rudimentary shops and warehouses. The landing pads for the Old Port were torn up to make room for what the locals call "The Port," a set of buildings that were constructed a century ago, with bolder architecture and more modern design.`
	spaceport `	Some distance away is the "New Port," a towering structure with robotic cargo lifts and large hangars for more expensive ships. Meanwhile, plans are apparently underway for an expansion of the New Port. You can't help but wonder what the new expansion will be named.`

planet Zydee
	attributes moon uninhabited
	landscape land/enceladus_1
	description `Although this moon initially seems barren and lifeless, there is evidence that the nearby Gegno Scin have recently attempted to set up an outpost here. Several partially-constructed buildings and landing zones are scattered about the surface, but none of them show any signs of activity, likely due to recent warfare with the Gegno Vi. Despite this, a small number of satellites actively orbit Zydee, likely providing important tactical information such as the volume of system traffic.`
