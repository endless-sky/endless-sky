	description `This planet is the collective seat of what are known as the Old Houses, the noble families who held territorial claims to this region of space before the collapse of the Predecessors' empire and the arrival of the so-called New Houses fleeing their crumbling society.`
	description `	While today the planet is geologically stable, it has experienced major tectonic shifts in the past, folding the planet's surface into a number of visually spectacular canyons and mountain ranges. Since it serves such an important political role, tectonic activity on this planet is closely monitored, and even though there have been no major earthquakes since the Successors settled here, most of the buildings here are built to withstand even large and destructive geological shifts.`
	spaceport `Unexpectedly small for a planet of this importance, the spaceport on Aava-Aasa-Khora is composed of a number of small buildings made out of surprisingly flexible materials. While the sensation of the landing pad bowing under your ship's weight is unsettling, to say the least, it shows no signs of damage or structural fatigue.`
	spaceport `	The inside of the spaceport is very similar, with soft, rounded shapes, and flexible building materials. The floor seems to sink a little as you step on it, almost like it is actually a viscous liquid rather than a solid material.`

Outside of the cities, which are clustered around the equator, Ablub's Invention is uninhabited except by the native lifeforms, including strange, spindly-legged quadrupeds, awkward birds with leathery wings, and amphibians with webbed feet and long, whiskered snouts.`
	spaceport `The day-night cycle here is at least three times as long as any of the Coalition's species are habituated to, so the entire city enters a "false nighttime" in the middle of the day, shuttering all the windows so that the locals can rest and reset their biological clocks. And in the middle of the night, the city is brightly lit for a "false day."`

Its methane atmosphere is dominated by a titanic hurricane covering the dayside half of the planet, the result of tidal forces drawing streams of air and clouds into a planet-sized storm. The eye of the hurricane is surprisingly calm, but the heat of perpetual daylight drives temperatures higher than what is habitable for most life.`

The ice moon may have been captured by Aetuah in times past as a rogue planet, and the distance of the gas giant from the system center suggests it might be a rogue planet itself as well. In time, the gravitational force exhibited by Aetuah will tear apart the ice moon, plummeting it into the abyss.`
	description `	The most striking features of Aetuah are large oval-shaped organisms inhabiting the upper atmosphere.

The next settlers were pirates who believed that a planet free from laws and constraints would be a great base of operations.`
	description `	The anarchist farming communes, each operating independently but trading with outsiders to gain necessary supplies, are clustered in the barely temperate climate near the equator. The pirate bases, having a much more ready source of supplies, are located wherever there are flat landing areas close to craggy, defensible mountains.`

It also houses a vast museum of cultural artifacts dating back to long before the start of the space age. Today the station is mostly populated by visitors looking for particularly arcane writings or information, and librarians who have devoted their lives to keeping the archives well-indexed and up to date.`

While unattractive for settlement due to the scarcity of greenery, Amathil is still home to the descendents of those who arrived on the first few sublight starships, back when little was known about the planet besides that it had an oxygenated atmosphere. The unique culture that has since grown here, under a unified planetary government, emphasizes a sense of community and generosity - or at least that is how the locals like to be perceived by outsiders.`
	spaceport `Thanks to its abundant solar energy, the cost of powering the laser launch array that served Amathil was quite low, and glittering fields of solar panels surround the entire site. The spaceport itself is spartan, with Amathil not receiving much traffic on a daily basis even before the Incursion.

Even more significant was a long, slender megastructure near the station, appearing as though construction on it had barely been started.`

Most are cracked, many others reduced to rubble, and a scant few are intact enough for the deep carvings that cover their surface to be read. These glyphs were seemingly designed to be easily translated, which Avgi researchers quickly did. There was much excitement when it was realized that the monoliths contained instructions and advice on various technologies, but this quickly turned to disappointment when a years-long survey revealed that no monolith had information on anything more advanced than the steam engine.`

Tidally locked, one face of the gas planet is heated to incandescence while the other experiences temperatures cold enough to freeze the water and ammonia out of its mostly hydrogen atmosphere. This drives a cycle of winds that ring the entire planet, producing immense cyclones capable of throwing clouds to the edge of space.`
	description `	The erosion of the solar wind against Avalet produces a bright cometary tail visible from Aviskir, and in multiple Avgi mythologies the planet occupied a role of preeminence: a messenger, or a king, or even a creator.

Since their fall, the pirates of the region have maintained the stations - although with considerably less organization than what was upheld by the central government.`
	spaceport `Given the uninhabitability of the hot side of the planet, the spaceport and other major infrastructure is just as mobile as the mining stations. The spaceport is located close to the planet's terminator, cast in a perpetual twilight.

	description `Cyreal was one of the first extrasolar worlds to be colonized by the Avgi, and, as with the other neighboring worlds, it was settled by slower than light starships. During a period of widespread scattered settlement, this low-gravity moon's sharp mountains and tall forests became popular with asteroid miners grown weary of cramped spacecraft. When the hyperdrive brought unprecedented immigration from other worlds, conservationists set aside large swathes of the moon as natural preserves, concentrating most residents in a small group of dense cities.`
	description `	While somewhat metal-poor itself, by exploiting the asteroids and other bodies in the Span system, Cyreal developed a robust industrial base that allowed it to weather the economic shock that came with the invention of the hyperdrive relatively easily.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is large for the moon's population, a product of its status as a hub for the many mining ships in the system and the ease of lofting cargo in the low gravity. Unlike most Avgi spaceports, it was designed to primarily serve spaceplanes, enabled by the thick atmosphere and low gravity. Together with the sprawling spaceport complex, built along the side of an equatorial mountain, a set of shorter runways also service the moon's local aircraft.`

As those conflicts subsided, those privateers began turning towards piracy. Their influence was brought to an end when a fleet from Earth took control of the station, later becoming a military base for the fledgling Republic.`
	description `	In the 29th century, control of Dagon Station was passed to the Syndicate, who eventually vacated the station due to its age. Local laws prevent landing on Dagon Station without a permit, but the Syndicate doesn't pay close attention to whether or not anybody lands here, anyway.`

The skies here are frequently blanketed in a volcanic haze. This world is rich in oil deposits, a relic of a past when more life flourished here, but drilling for oil is costly because the shifting ground can damage drills or seal up previously productive bore-holes. Since this also makes processing difficult, the oil is exported off-world for processing into plastics, instead of having the manufacturing performed locally.`

The windows are caked with soot and grime, and the few plants that grow here have a thin layer of volcanic ash on their leaves.

The most striking aspect of the base, however, is how empty it is. There are enough buildings here to make it feel like a small city, but only one small corner of the port is in use; the rest of the buildings are boarded up. And there are enough landing pads and hangars to house perhaps a fifth of the entire fleet, but they are nearly all empty at the moment.`

Barges travel slowly through the oceans harvesting these microorganisms out of the water and separating out the chemical compounds they provide.`

The tectonic activity of its moon, large enough to qualify as a binary pair, causes an almost perpetual global earthquake that can be felt by simply standing on the planet.`

The anemic erosion, as a result, has done little to smooth the scars left by the influence of the tidal forces that wrack Gestli's surface.`

Geyser was settled in the very first wave of space colonization, before refueling depots were available anywhere but Earth itself, so the only systems that could maintain trade with Earth were those that were only a few jumps away. Today, most of the industry centers around oil drilling and manufacturing, and the remaining workers are those who are too poor to leave.`
	description `	In recent years, Geyser's economy has not been able to support repairs to the centuries-old terraforming equipment, and as a result the climate has become increasingly arid, and it is difficult to grow food crops here.`
	spaceport `This spaceport was built seven or eight centuries ago, and its once-grand architecture has now fallen into decay. A ring of hangars with arched concrete ceilings surrounds a central complex of warehouse towers, whose upper stories once held food courts and luxury hotel rooms.`
	spaceport `	By now many of the hangars have collapsed, and the ones that remain have rugged plastic netting bolted to the ceilings to protect ships from falling fragments of concrete. Only one of the food courts remains active, and although a few of the hotel rooms are still used, the marble fixtures and tile floors that were once so polished and clean are now chipped and cracked and worn down.`

However, during a short portion of the year, Ghneoe experiences an intense water cycle that results in a boom of greenery and wildlife activity, developing a short-lived but flourishing ecosystem. Much of the flora and fauna have adapted to such drastic shifts in climate, and return to a dormant state once the intense heat cycle returns.`

Most of the Hai settlements here are in the valleys closer to sea level, where the air is dense enough for them to breathe comfortably. The tectonic activity has left many ancient sea-beds exposed, providing access to bountiful supplies of oil. To the Hai, oil is too precious a resource to be used for fuel; instead they process it into plastic and use the byproducts in other chemical processes.`

It is only from the surface that it becomes apparent that this thriving ecosystem is in fact dominated by a mind-boggling variety of insects, large and small. The bugs are everywhere, permeating every part of the planet, and recent colonization efforts were thrwarted by just how inconvenient they make life on this world. Insecticides are quickly adapted to, eggs and larvae can lie dormant for years before re-emerging, and the swarms of insects devour anything they can sink their chitinous teeth into.`

	description `In the very early days of hyperspace travel, most settlers chose to put down roots within a few jumps of Earth, because until more fuel depots were built, colonies farther out would seldom be visited by cargo ships. As a result, a lot of effort was put into terraforming and developing worlds that would have been passed over by most colonists today.`
	description `	New China is one such world, and it is now overpopulated, and poor enough that maintaining the terraforming equipment and climate requires almost a third of the planetary government's tax income.`
	spaceport `The "new port" here was built several centuries ago, when the grand but impractical spaceport built by the original settlers had deteriorated to the point where it was no longer usable. This port is much simpler by comparison: just a ring of landing pads of various sizes around a large central building with ten levels of warehouse space accessible by freight elevator.`
	spaceport `	There are always locals hanging around the port, some of them mere children, who are trying to find a cheap ride off-planet.`

	description `Due to complex atmospheric currents and swiftly changing seasons, the surface of New Finding is constantly scoured by powerful winds, making it difficult for soil to accumulate except in sheltered canyons and gorges. Each of these patches of greenery stands like an island amid a sea of bare rock. Over time, where the forests are able to take hold and grow, they spread outward and begin to turn more of the rock into habitable soil. On the exposed slopes, rock slides are a constant danger.`
	description `	Due to the limited habitable land, the local economy focuses on high tech medicine and equipment that can be produced by relatively small laboratories.`
	spaceport `The New Finding spaceport is in a canyon, with hangars cut into both the canyon walls and delicate covered bridges linking them together. Attempting to land here without crashing into anything is a harrowing experience.`
	spaceport `	The bottom of the canyon is a bright green ribbon of trees and plants that stands out in sharp contrast against the red and yellow layers of sandstone.`

	description `New Greenland was first settled about six hundred years ago, at the peak of the "Turf Wars" era where most planets were controlled by powerful corporations and their struggles often turned into outright warfare with privately owned fleets and armies. The people who came to New Greenland were looking for a world so marginal and undesirable that they could live here in peace without being caught in the crossfire.`
	description `	The locals here grow food in greenhouses and specialize in making warm winter clothing, which is this planet's only export.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is near the equator, but it is still cold enough that there is always some snow on the ground.`
	spaceport `	You have never seen as many people in fur coats as there are here; what might be considered a luxury elsewhere is a necessity here, where the cheapest clothing material is the pelts of indigenous animals.`
	spaceport `	From the size of the claws hanging decoratively off some of the coats, you have to give a grudging respect to the hunters. High fashion is not an industry that usually involves risk of dismemberment.`
	spaceport `	New Greenland was one of the worlds occupied during the Alpha Wars. Despite this, Remembrance Day celebrations on New Greenland are quite humble, with most simply going about business as usual.`

	description `Like its namesake on ancient Earth, New Holland is a world of oceans and low country. It is an old planet, its tectonic activity long since silenced, worn smooth by eons of weather. For those who live here, flooding is a constant threat, requiring a vast network of dikes and levees. But the floods also refresh the soil, making this one of the most fertile farming worlds in the region.`
	description `	As the population has boomed, and as the farms have been consolidated and become more mechanized, large cities have grown to house factories and workers.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is on the fringes of one of the factory towns. In the distance are row after row of identical brick buildings; in the opposite direction, a safe distance from the city, are the cooling towers of several nuclear power plants. The port itself is laid out for maximum efficiency in loading and unloading cargo regardless of the weather or time of day: a row of hangars, open at one side to ships coming in and departing, and on the other to a road carrying a steady stream of trucks.`
	spaceport `	Modest Remembrance Day decorations have been set up around the spaceport, along with a sampling of the planet's produce. In the distance, you can see marginally more lavish decorations set up within the main city.`

There is a small cafeteria, offering you a choice between two kinds of soup, some pre-made sandwiches, or the hot meal of the day.`

	description `New India was first settled less than a century ago, and the settlers are still struggling to establish themselves. It is a hospitable climate, but the amount of labor needed to clear forests and to plow rocky fields has meant that the towns here can only grow very slowly.`
	description `	The farms grow both food crops and cotton, and very recently they have begun manufacturing their own textiles instead of just shipping the raw cotton off-world for processing.`
	spaceport `New India's spaceport is a ring of low wooden buildings around a wide landing area paved with concrete slabs. Around the perimeter carts of trade goods are driven, some being pulled by tractors and others, by horses or oxen. You even think you see a few carts being pulled by water buffalo.`
	spaceport `	Most of the buildings are for storage, but from somewhere nearby you can smell fresh-baked bread.`
	spaceport `	Despite the relative recency of settlement, Remembrance Day celebrations appear to be occurring, with Alpha Wars ballads audible from one of the spaceport buildings.`

	description `New Portland is a cloudy planet orbiting a dim star; the only reason it is not completely frozen is because of the heat trapped by its upper atmosphere. There are only a handful of towns here, and nothing big enough to warrant being called a city. Most of the settlers are subsistence farmers who can only dream about life on other worlds. Many houses here do not even have running water or personal computers.`
	description `	Some of the farms near the spaceport are planted with different crops forming abstract patterns visible from the air. Such a whimsical extravagance seems particularly odd when you consider that the owners will never be able to afford to see their fields from that angle. But perhaps that is precisely the point.`
	spaceport `The largest town on New Portland has set aside a landing area for ships, but it is barely what could be called a spaceport. Aside from the refueling station and a few sheds, there are no other buildings, just an open field of packed gravel, with grass and weeds peeking up in places where it has avoided the blast from landing spacecraft. A few farmers have parked wagons here and are trading food and other goods with the visiting ships.`
	spaceport `	It appears that the spaceport has not been embellished for Remembrance Day. The main celebrations are likely taking place in the planet's individual towns.`

	description `	A century ago, some entrepreneurs settled here and built a factory complex that is entirely powered by wind and solar energy, because there are so few cloudy days here and the wind and sunshine are so reliable. The factory is mostly autonomous, with only a few thousand people living here to perform maintenance or to grow crops in irrigated fields.`
	spaceport `The spaceport consists of a few large concrete slabs, each big enough for a dozen small ships or a pair of Bulk Freighters to land on. Farther away are fields of solar panels and the factories that they power. The spaceport buildings themselves, however, are underground, where less energy is needed to keep the air cool. Light pipes bring sunlight down from the surface to illuminate the subterranean storage caverns and living quarters, while keeping the searing heat of the sunlight out.`
	spaceport `	The living quarters have been modestly decorated for Remembrance Day, with ceremonial flags displayed inside the dining hall and Alpha Wars medals set up along a corridor, each one belonging to an ancestor of those who immigrated here.`

	description `	Although it has been inhabited for centuries, in many places the terrain is so rugged that roads cannot be built, leaving several of the smaller towns almost completely isolated. Taking advantage of this isolation, several orders of Buddhist monks have built monasteries here.`
	description `	In the lowlands, large farms support sprawling cities full of factories, a striking contrast to the simplicity and isolation of the mountain villages.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is in a hilly region, just outside of the largest city, with a view of a valley full of farms that stretch for tens of kilometers, all the way down to the ocean.`
	spaceport `	The port is much less modern than the city nearby; it was built by the early settlers and has not been significantly updated since then, because the focus has been on improving life for the locals, not for their occasional visitors.`
	spaceport `	Befitting their isolationist stance, the port has not been dolled up for Remembrance Day, though you are able to make out a celebration taking place in the city below.`

	description `A planet of violent storms and frequent earthquakes, New Tortuga does not have a lot to offer the average spacefarer. The most significant settlements on the planet are built predominantly underground, far from any fault lines, with only obscure, hardened access areas. Combined with the fortress-like blast doors that blockade the spaceport entrances, New Tortuga is the perfect place for those looking for somewhere to hide.`
	description `	Most of the inhabitants of this planet are Syndicate dissidents who mainly support themselves through manufacturing. The Syndicate often destroys pirate factories at their borders, but their fleets do not find the monetary cost of venturing as far as New Tortuga worth the benefit. Here, shipyards, factories, and outfitters provide a continuous supply of goods and services for the system.`
	spaceport `As you walk through the spaceport, scattered amidst the bars and black-markets, you notice a surprising number of religious buildings. There are a variety of churches, synagogues, mosques, temples, and others you can't quite remember the names of. Most of the shops are run not by pirates, but by ordinary folk, many wearing religious garb. The citizens here interact with pirates with friendliness and warmth, rather than the hostility and fear you see on other pirate worlds.`

	description `	Due to the somewhat dim light of the star Algorel, and the cloudiness of the atmosphere, this is not a good world for farming, and the population remains quite small.`

	description `	Curiously, Nilokep has an elevated level of ambient background radiation, largely due to the dispersion of pulverized granite, containing trace amounts of uranium, across its surface.

With an abnormally dense core and storms more ruthless than in any other gas giants in the Coalition, it swallowed the first five predecessors of this station before they could be completed, and though this one has remained in a stable orbit for thousands of years after its completion, superstition surrounding the planet makes it so that the Siphon receives very few visitors.`

Rather than simply ejecting her crew out of the airlock, she packed them into an escape pod that would survive the upper atmosphere of the planet. In the years that followed, many seeking to prove themselves the meanest pirate in the galaxy sought to emulate her example by making a pilgrimage to her Locker whenever a crew member went too far out of line.`

Aside from running the fueling station, one of the few jobs for the workers here is to operate the bulldozers that push away the snowdrifts and keep the station from being buried beneath them. Although the air is breathable, ships that land here connect directly to docking tubes, to protect their crews from the icy air.`

Inside, the air is still cold, but at least you are sheltered from the violent winds that sweep across the rest of the planet's surface. Some of the locals, accustomed to the cold, walk about in their shirtsleeves as if this were a balmy summer day.`

Claiming that the industrial emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases would eventually warm the planet and turn it into a tropical paradise, they were able to draw enough settlers to keep the factories going.`
