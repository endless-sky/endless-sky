		description `Long ago, this planet was home to several Korath oil mining settlements, but now all that remains visible are the tops of a few dozen of the tallest buildings. Everything else has been buried by sandstorms.`
		description `	Due to a recent shift in climate the deserts have begun shrinking once more, with local vegetation growing to cover more and more land each year. The Wanderers, working together with the Kor Efreti, have founded a settlement here and begun working to accelerate the process of rejuvenating the wastelands.`
		spaceport `This small settlement is populated by a roughly equal number of Korath and Wanderer settlers. Since most of them do not speak each other's language, the two groups do not mingle much, and communicate mostly via gestures and drawings. It's not much, but it's at least a start for the two species to begin learning from each other.`

			`You inform the Wanderers that the Korath exiles are now producing war drones. "This is [unfortunate, regrettable]," says Sobari Tele'ek. "Clearly they [anticipate, expect] further conflict in the future."`
			`	Tema'a Iriket says, "Perhaps they are [afraid of, threatened by] us and seek only to have the means to [defend, protect] themselves. The important thing is that the drones in this [territory, area] have been [neutralized, pacified] and we can now focus on our true work."`
			`	From there, the conversation shifts to an excited discussion about what worlds they will settle on next and what their next steps should be in building relationships with the Kor Efret and the Kor Mereti collective. The exiles may become a threat some time in the future, but for now the Wanderers are eager to pursue their peacetime calling in this new territory that the Eye has led them to.`
