The Wanderers install the Mind in a niche near the back of the bay and then begin welding sheets of metal over the opening to prevent the Mereti drones from gaining easy access to the Mind to shut it down or destroy it. Meanwhile, every few seconds the bay is lit by a bright flash of weapons fire or exploding ships outside. Hopefully the Wanderer fleet is managing to hold its own against the drones.`

			`As you come in for a landing, you see that the Kor Mereti drones, which up until recently had been ignoring the surfaces of the planets they controlled, are now constructing some sort of facility on <origin>. Sunlight glints off the fresh and spotless buildings, but it is not until you are only a few dozen meters above it that you realize what the facility is.`
			`	It is a greenhouse.`
			`	Inside the facility are rows and rows of plants of all different shapes and sizes. Like the Mereti drones themselves, the layout of the facility is random and haphazard. Drones nearly the size of a shuttlecraft buzz around it like bees, some of them arriving with fresh samples and others tending and watering the plants.`

It sounds like it's either conversing with someone else, or perhaps trying hard to remember something. "Yes, but the Wanderers..." It tilts its body closer to you. In a slightly less booming voice, which is perhaps its attempt at a whisper, it says, "The Wanderers created our soul."`

			label plant
			`	While you are still trying to process the drone's statement, another drone comes flying out of the greenhouse facility carrying a large square metal pot. The pot is filled with soil, and in the soil is planted a small, very dry-looking bush with a few dead leaves clinging to it. "We broke it," says the drone. "Fix it please."`

			`It must reveal something interesting about Wanderer psychology that when you return, they are more interested in poking and prodding the dead plant than in hearing your report about the Mereti drones. But once they've sent off a soil sample to be analyzed and can achieve no more until the results come back, they listen to your story.`
			`	"Our goal was to communicate with them," says Tele'ek, "not to [destroy, erase] their identity and replace it with our own. What have we done?"`
			`	Meto Pa'aret has been listening quietly, and finally speaks up. "Identity is the story the mind tells to [explain? justify? give meaning to?] its existence," he says.

			`When you last left <planet>, there were less than a dozen buildings in the greenhouse facility. It has now grown to the size of a major spaceport, including some towers that are dozens of stories high. Some plants now grow on open-air terraces; others are in domed enclosures tall enough to house fully-grown trees. The larger domes also have birds flying about inside them, and some larger land animals as well. Everything is built of gleaming steel and glass and filled with lush vegetation; from high above the facility looks like a scattered handful of diamonds and emeralds.`
			`	The freighter you were escorting was full of professors and researchers, who are clearly not used to any sort of military discipline or to living in a dangerous region of space: the moment the freighter lands they fly off toward the greenhouse without bothering to wait for instructions from their supposed manager. Several of them are already engaged in conversation with the drones, while others are exploring the different rooms of the facility, examining plants and probing soil with their talons.`

Instead, they want to focus on their true calling: terraforming planets.`
