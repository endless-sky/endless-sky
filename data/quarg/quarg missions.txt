		log "Factions" "Quarg" `The Quarg are tall, thin, inscrutable aliens who evolved on a very small planet and can live comfortably on worlds with atmosphere so thin that a human being could not breathe it. They discovered spaceflight millions of years ago. Many of them live on artificially constructed ringworlds, including one in human space. They live at peace with most sentient species and claim to be in communication with an even older species named the Drak.`
		log "Factions" "Drak" `The Drak are supposedly the oldest living species in the galaxy. The Quarg say that the Drak act as something like galactic peacekeepers or police, and will intervene if a species invents a weapon so terrible that it could drive that species to extinction.`
		conversation
			`You had seen pictures and videos of the Quarg before, but this is your first time in a spaceport that is owned by them. The architecture is truly alien: uncomfortably tall ceilings, strange colors, and walls that never quite seem to meet at right angles. The Quarg themselves are equally strange, towering above you, some nearly three meters tall. Their legs bend backwards at the bottom, like a dog walking on its hind feet, and they move gracefully and almost silently.`
			`	Most of the Quarg you see are dressed entirely in shades of gray, or only slight hints of color. Quarg fashion seems to revolve not around color, but texture: coarse and fine woven fabrics, patterns like lizard scales or cobblestones, and occasional decorative fringes of sponge-like material. Their skin is deep gray, sometimes with a hint of green or blue or brown beneath it, with a fine scale pattern like a reptile. But what makes their eyes startling is that they look very human, except that some of them have gold or violet irises instead of green or blue or brown. They have no hair, but many are wearing small cloth caps or hoods.`
			`	One of the Quarg notices you gawking at them and walks over. It squats down on its haunches so that its eyes are level with your own, and says, "Hello." Its voice is deep, sounding like an accordion or the buzz of a beehive blended with the hum of a starship engine.`
			choice
				`	"Hello."`
			`	Speaking slowly and deliberately, it says, "I think you are new here. Are you what is called a tourist?"`
			choice
				`	"Yes."`
				`	"No, I'm a merchant captain, I'm here to buy and sell cargo."`
			`	"I see." The Quarg blinks slowly. Its eyelids come from the sides of its eyes, instead of up and down. In an otherwise so human eye, the effect is disconcerting. "Many humans have many questions when they see us, and we the Quarg live for many lifetimes of humans, so it is not burdensome for this one to speak with you."`

			`	"Many. Most of them young, so much younger than the Quarg. Many foolish. A few wise. Many travel only along the ancient roads between the stars. A few need no roads to travel by. And some reshape the galaxy at will. But the Quarg are like no other, because we have nothing that the others covet."`
			choice
				`	"What do you mean?"`
			
			label quarg
			`	"We the Quarg are unique of all the species in the galaxy. Our species began on the moon of a great gas giant, on a planet most small, that gathered about itself very little air. We cannot step many steps on the worlds that the Hai, the Korath, the other species desire. And the worlds like our home, you could not breathe their so thin air, for our lungs are very subtle. And we are an old race, and do not kill for sport or whimsy, so the Drak gave us the gift, that we may go among the other races and settle where we please, and make friends of all, because none dare be our enemy."`

They tend and cultivate the pathways between the stars, and prune away the paths that any species could travel to make war against another. And they hold the secret of travel beyond those pathways, and give the secret only to a worthy few, so that peace may prevail." It taps its chest with one hand, signaling that the Quarg are among those few.`
			`	"Not that the Drak are strangers to war. Planets and moons and even stars were consumed in their wars and are no more. But then they learned wisdom, and have fought no more wars, many millions of human years. They live nearby, but they keep to themselves, and intervene in the affairs of other races only to prevent their destruction or the use of obscene technologies of war."`
			choice
				`	"We humans have used some rather destructive weapons against each other, and no alien species ever stepped in to put a stop to it."`
				`	"Well, I hope we never do anything bad enough to force them to intervene."`
					goto closing
			
			`	"You have done what? Awakened the atom? There are weapons far worse than that. Consuming planets. Snuffing out stars. Tearing the flesh of space and time itself. Weapons of chaos I pray your reckless race cannot yet even conceive of. These things will attract the attention of the Drak, because they nearly destroyed this galaxy once, and must not be allowed to do so again."`
			choice
				`	"Well, if there are technologies that dangerous out there, I hope the Drak do continue to succeed in keeping them from being used."`
			
			label closing
			`	"I hope so too, human." The Quarg stands up, towering over you once again. "As long as you are a seeker of peace, you are most welcome on our worlds at any time." It bows to you. You are not sure if that is a Quarg gesture too, or if it is simply imitating a human custom, but you bow in return, and the Quarg walks quietly away.`

Unlike most Quarg you've seen, it is wearing a pale, faded white robe, with patches of red-colored chains (that somehow perfectly transition into fabric again) becoming more and more prominent closer to the top, culminating in a firm, crimson hood covering its head. Most surprising of all for a Quarg, however, is the large scar taking up much of the left side of its face, completely covering where its left eye should be.`

As you two sit down, you notice it pauses mid-breath. After a few seconds of adjusting itself in the seat, the Quarg finally speaks up.`
			`	"Those three species arose in relative rapid succession, all in close proximity, compared to how other species tend to be separated by long periods of time, and longer still their distances." Its voice, while still sharing the buzzing, deep hums you've grown to expect from the Quarg, is broken up every other word by something like a crack - or a creak - as if certain vocal cords have grown sore, with an uncomfortable sound akin to an out of tune cello mixing its way into the Quarg's words. "So large are the gaps, that one might never learn of those that came before. But, that was not the case for the three. The first of them, the Saryds, were in many ways much like us Quarg in our younger days, and we perhaps were much too lenient because of that..." It stops, and brings one hand over its head, and then the other, closing its eye as if in a sudden headache. Your eyes almost instinctively go to its scales, expecting them to change like other Quarg you've seen. But, their colors remain unaltered, the same pale gray and silver shades. A few seconds pass, and it brings down its hands back to its lap, opening its eye as it continues. "The Kimek, traumatized by the billions fallen in their famines, sought help to make sure they would never face such a crisis again, and were eager to establish friendly relations with the Saryds. The Arachi, in a way, parallel humanity's development, though they were less keen on letting their inner conflicts be made public. They were the last of the three, and upon meeting their two seniors, invested heavily in research to catch up."`
			`	It pauses again, taking a look around the spaceport. It fixates on you for a bit, then on the ships landing and departing here. "In the intersecting point of their territories, we built our ringworlds. Seven thousand Earth years ago, the three species of the Coalition sought to take over those rings. After centuries... no, a millennium of fighting, we left that part of the galaxy."`

			`	"Whatever reasons they had, whatever drove them to attack us, we cannot quite comprehend... No." It stops, not sighing or showing much emotion, its scales still showing no sign of changing. It looks at the ceiling again, then back at you. "No. You are tired of hearing this same story from us Quarg, are you not? That the foolish and young species warred for no good reason." It pauses again, contemplating its words. "That war was not the first instance where we lost a ring of ours, but never did any of us wish for any ring to be lost in the first place. With three rings there, with the living space for over three trillion Quarg being constructed, we got awfully... protective of that region, in order to prevent outside interference from causing us trouble again. Our relations with the Kimek and Arachi were a far cry from the initial success and amicability we enjoyed with the Saryds, and when an Arach ship first showed signs of technology that repaired its hull platings mid-flight, an achievement even the Saryds were yet to make, we... jumped to conclusions."`

					goto end
			`	It slowly turns its head over to face you, with its eye gazing into your own. An uncomfortable minute passes at a snail's pace, as you seem to struggle keeping eye contact with the Quarg, while at the same time finding it difficult to look elsewhere.`
			`	"We had gone there to protect the three species. To guide them. To observe them. We failed the latter, losing track of wisdom and reason in favor of fearing past shames. In that, our guidance became compromised, for they trusted us no longer. We were no longer seen as protectors, but as those they had to protect themselves against."`

We do not kill for sport, but it has become as natural for a Quarg to defend a ring as it would be for a human to defend their family.`
			`	"By the billions, defenders arose, ignoring our ways of peace, what social customs we were expected to follow, and... what you may call 'orders.' After a few centuries, those that tolerated, or were forced to tolerate the request for a ceasefire, were evacuated from the rings, and then it was only a matter of time before those of us that remained were overrun by the Coalition."`
