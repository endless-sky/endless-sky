	description "The RG15 Ion Torch Thruster is the smallest torch thruster found amongst Gegno Vi ships and it is almost exclusively mounted on the Slate. It's not amazingly efficient, weighing more and producing more heat than most thrusters of a similar size, but it also has a slightly lower energy consumption rate."

	description "This steering system is meant for the smallest of Gegno Vi ships, and mounting it exclusively on anything larger than a Shuttle-class ship is unheard of. Still, it offers relatively high energy efficiency so some Gegno pilots use it as a cheap addon."

	description "Ion Torch Thrusters are the Gegno's equivalent of humanity's ion thrusters, but are still earlier in design and lacking in most departments when compared. They have heavier frames and their thrust output is a lot more chaotic and explosive, causing them to run notably hotter but require slightly less energy. The RG18 is the most common-sized thruster amongst Gegno Vi vessels, and a notable size at that."

	description "The RG18 Steering system is decently hefty for a steering system of its size. Most mid-ranged Gegno Vi ships run these as a minimum to be able to turn their already heavy ships, and they perform their job just well enough."

	description "RG3 Ion Torch Thrusters are the Gegno's largest thrusters and the oldest still used. Based off of the massive thrusters that powered early Gegno generation ships, these are only found on the largest of Gegno spacecraft, overweighing and overheating anything smaller out of the option."

	description "In order to power the small Halite frame, the Gegno Scin developed this smaller engine system. Based on their larger plasma thrusters, these engines are much more efficient than the Vi's larger, more sluggish Ion Engines, which would never be compact or light enough to run on a fighter."

	description "Rather than further developing on the Ion Torch design of the Gegno Vi, the Gegno Scin began work on a plasma-based thruster concept. They are more compact, weigh less, and produce significantly more thrust. However, since Ion Torches expel a percentage of heat in their thrust, the more stable and powerful SC thrusters tend to run hotter."

	description "The new SC plasma thruster design excels as a better steering system too, allowing Gegno Scin ships to turn at much faster rates than their opposing brothers. What might take a Gegno Vi ship a long time to maneuver, takes a Scin ship running these only a moment's worth or less."

	description "The Gegno Scin have taken a second step forward from the SC-14 class Engine System, incorporating both reverse and forward thrust. In order to field the SC9, the Scin had to design their largest ships around the system, rather than fit it on later. The reverse thrust is especially important in engagements with the Gegno Vi's forward-heavy combat vessels."
