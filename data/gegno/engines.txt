	description "The RG15 Ion Torch Thruster is the the smallest torch thruster found amongst Gegno Vi ships, almost exclusively mounted on the Slate. It's not amazingly efficient, weighing more and producing more heat than most thrusters of a similar sized, but also has a slightly lower energy consumption rate."

	description "This steering system that incorporates RG15 thrusters is only meant for the smallest of Gegno Vi ships, unheard of being mounted on anything larger than a Shuttle-class ship. It's energy requirement is a notch lower than normal, so some Gegno pilots use it as a cheap addon."

	description "Ion Torch Thrusters are the Gegno's equivalent of humanity's ion thrusters, but are still earlier in design and lacking in most deparments when compared. They have heavier frames, and their thrust output is a lot more chaotic and explosive, causing them to run notably hotter, but require slightly less energy. The RG18 is the most common-sized thruster amongst Gegno Vi vessels, and a notable size at that."

	description "The RG18 Steering system is decently hefty for a steering system of its size. Most mid-ranged Gegno Vi ships run these as a minimum to be able to turn their already low-maneuverability ships, and they perform their job just well enough."

	description "RG3 Ion Torch Thrusters are the Gegno's `Big Daddy` thrusters, and the oldest in the running. Based off of the massive thrusters that powered early Gegno generation ships, these thrusters are only found on the largest of Gegno ships, weighing and overheating anything smaller out of a choice."
