	description "The Augen-class is an ancient battleship design proposed by the Vi as a large weapons platform for their Ballistic Cannons. It was built in secret over many years in the huge canyon shipyard present on the foggy world of Enbi, and for many periods of time its construction was put on hold. The recent civil war with the Gegno Scin gave reason to complete the warship, although it is still somewhat of a relic compared to current vessels in the service of the Vi fleet."
	description `	This project was meant to result in two sister-ship behemoths, not one, but the blueprints for the other design went missing early in the process, and are currently nowhere to be found.`

	description "Due to the Gegno splitting up and colonizing new worlds, they needed a smaller ship to do a lot of the grunt work instead of always relying on their enormous (and expensive) City-Ships. The Shale is the Gegno's equivalent of a shuttle: small and compact with transportation being its single purpose. Whether it be cargo, trade goods, travellers, or recruits, Shales are the foundation of the Gegno interstellar civilization."

	description "Almost as large as a human cruiser, Dolomites are the Gegno's most common jack-of-all-trades cargo vessel in service, having been used since the early days of space colonization. They are used as both passenger liners and cargo vessels, and carry decent amounts of both to note. Due to its popularity and continuous usage, both the Gegno Vi and Gegno Scin factions have developed further on the original design for their own purposes."

	description "To fuel their exponentially increasing construction rates, and corresponding need for materials, the Gegno decided to design a new ship class for the sole purpose of mining. The resulting platform, the Gypsum, is not much more than a flying drill with cargo containers, engines, and a bridge attached behind it, making it cost-efficient and easy to manufacture."
	description `	Because of the Gegno's limited technology, the Gypsum is much more sluggish than similarly sized ships elsewhere in the galaxy, making it too slow to effectively catch faster asteroids. For those asteroids it can catch up to, the powerful excavator drill is able to grind materials out with ease.`

	description "The Schist is the Gegno Vi's variation of the Gegno's old mid-range Dolomite. It has a decent cargo size, and enough bunks to carry a whole platoon of Gegno warriors. It is the primary vessel used to transport recruits to the front lines, and veterans back to home territories." 
	description `	Although a relatively light armament is an exception for the Vi's very aggressive and combat-oriented ship design philosophy, Schists still carry a pair of cannon mounts to be able to bring something, rather than nothing, to a fight.`

	description "Coesites are smaller warships that the Scin use as screening vessels during battle with the Vi. They are speedy and carry two turret mounts which allows them to always be orbiting and firing on the move. Coesites are the designated platform for the Scin's anti-shell turrets, allowing them to take out shells ahead of their larger ships to reduce incoming fire and turn the tide of war."

	description "Using a similar yet smaller frame to the Coesite, the Tridymite was designed as the production platform for the Gegno Scin's new Guile system. As its younger sibling, the Tridymite is a smaller escort vessel that provides anti-cannon screening for Scin fleets, while Coesites are armed with more offensive weaponry."

	description "Felsics are based on Schists, but offer many upgrades in exchange for less durability and space for engines. The Scin have opted for three turret mounts, as well as expanded capacity for outfits and weapons. All this allows these ships to perform logistical duties well as well as doubling as a secondary combat vessel, making up for the lack of a dedicated Scin warship."

	description "The mighty Feldspar is a Scin creation to behold. As a testbed for the new Halite Fighters, Feldspars bring their own small fleets with them and overwhelm their enemy. They also were designed as a semi-experimental platform, built around a brand new multi-engine system and the latest in Gegno plasma technology."
	description `	Able to keep a decent stance away from a battle while putting down artillery fire, Feldspars are quite a dangerously well-rounded ship for their size. On the downside, they are more susceptible to hull damage like any other Scin warship, especially when alone. As such, they rely on their fighters since they aren't a dedicated warship themselves.`

	description "Since Protoliths were largely acquired by the Vi before spaceship developmented progressed too far, the Scin had to design a brand new heavy freighter vessel from scratch. The Muscovite is able to perform in many roles, having a very large crew capability and cargo capacity."
	description `	Each Muscovite is also equipped with a rear fighter bay capable of carrying a Halite, allowing the Scin to transport fighters to outposts that need them for Feldspars. Like the Felspar, the Muscovite is also equipped with a brand new engine system, making a ship that can take a bit of a pounding faster as well.`
