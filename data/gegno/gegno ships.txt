	description `After the Gegno discovered hyperspace lanes and began to use them, their enormous (and expensive) generation ships became too cumbersome to use for the purpose of interstellar commerce, leading to the need for a smaller and more manageable ship such as this. The Shale is the Gegno's equivalent of a Shuttle: a small and compact transport. Whether it be cargo, trade goods, travelers, or recruits, Shales are the foundation of Gegno interstellar civilization.`

	description `Unlike many Gegno ships that are capable in a variety of roles, Granofels were designed for the sole purpose of hauling huge loads of cargo; they lack bunks for anything beyond a proper crew, and are most often found freighting massive shipments of both raw and refined ore to and from mining industries. They can also be seen paired with a mining vessel to extend the duration of a mining run due to the higher cargo capacity. Apart from mining, Granofels are also used in transporting heavy materials needed to construct other large ships.`

	description `To fuel their increasing need for materials, the Gegno designed a new ship class for the sole purpose of mining. The resulting platform, the Gypsum, is not much more than a flying drill with cargo containers, engines, and a bridge attached behind it, making it cost-efficient and easy to manufacture.`
	description `	Because Gegno engines are not very powerful, the Gypsum has difficulty chasing faster-moving asteroids. In order to alleviate this problem without needing to massively increase the engine space on the ship, the Gegno have instead developed the powerful Excavator Drill, which can shred asteroids in a matter of seconds, meaning the Gypsum only needs to be near an asteroid for a mere moment in order to mine it.`

	description `While the Gypsum has remained the most reliable mining platform for generations, the Corundum was designed for the purpose of modularity on account of the ever-growing technological potential of the Gegno. Using a similar principle to the Gypusm's design, the Corundum's structure is mostly built around not one but two adjustable drill systems that are capable of mounting more advanced mining tools.`
	description `	Although not able to mount the powerful Excavator Drill, the Corundum's engine capacity is twice that of the Gypsum, and the modularity of the two new mounting systems grants it the ability to adapt to future technologies that the Gegno may develop.`

The most notable feature is a long mace-like protrusion next to the Irate Cannon which is used for jousting and ramming other duelists.`
	description `	Being a mangled mess of machinery designed for only a single purpose, Dunites do not come equipped with nor have room for hyperdrives, and are purely intrastellar craft.`

	description `The Augen-Class is an ancient battleship proposed by the Vi as a large weapons platform for their Ballistic Cannons. It was built in secret over many years in Enbi's canyon shipyard, and for many periods of time its construction was put on hold. The recent civil war with the Scin gave reason to complete the warship, although it is still somewhat of a relic compared to current vessels in the service of the Vi fleet.`
	description `	This project was meant to result in two sister-ship behemoths, but the blueprints for the other design went missing early in the process, and are currently nowhere to be found.`

	description `While the style of longer battleship-esque vessels is a Gegno Vi staple, another shipyard rose to the competition for Vi warship designs. The Eclogite is one of the newest designs in the Vi fleet - a gunboat armed to the teeth with cannons, and maneuverability that the Vi's larger ships lack. It plays the role of a hit-and-run vessel, unloading volleys of shells against a target's armor in a rapid maneuver before adjusting its position for another run.`

	description `Hornfels are the workhorse of the Gegno Vi's military - decently sized, decently fast, and more than decently armed warships designed for the frontline of operations. Hornfels are also the most configurable ship in the Vi's fleet, lined with many mounting points to support cargo pods, allowing them to provide a secondary transport role for when the Vi require replacement supplies in war. Other variants of Hornfels are instead occasionally found with adjustments to carry a larger armament. This multi-role function is extremely valued and is the reason why the Hornfel is one of the Vi's most popular ships.`

	description `Gneiss battleships are the Gegno Vi's true sword and shield in war.

Gneiss also have extremely strong armor plating, and can take a hefty beating while firing threatening broadsides at the opposing force.`
	description `	Unfortunately, in exchange for huge firepower and defensive armor, they lack speed and maneuverability, even when fitted with the largest engine systems the Vi have to offer.`

	description `Granulites are descendants of the Gegno's early generation ships used to colonize nearby systems before the invention of the hyperdrive. They now carry hundreds of Vi both in and out of war, and huge cargo loads to supply depots. They are not typically used as warships, but can support enough weaponry to threaten most smaller vessels, or fend off larger ships long enough for reinforcements to arrive.`

Being a smaller design, these ships are relatively easy to manufacture, and are often fielded in groups so they may overtake vessels much larger than them.`

	description `The mighty Feldspar is a Scin creation to behold. As a testbed for the new Halite fighters, Feldspars bring their own small fleets with them and overwhelm their enemy. They were also designed as a semi-experimental platform, built around a brand new multi-engine system and the latest in Gegno plasma technology.`
	description `	Able to keep a decent stance away from a battle while putting down artillery fire, Feldspars are quite a dangerously well-rounded ship for their size. On the downside, they are more susceptible to hull damage like any other Scin warship, especially when alone. As such, they rely on their fighters to keep their enemies at a distance.`

	description `Epidotes are large independent research platforms with adequately-sized cargo holds, allowing them to perform as a reliable heavy freighter for the Gegno Scin. A large number of bunks either help transport groups of Scin scientists to their project destinations, or allow for mobile on-board demonstrations and observations. Each Epidote is equipped with a rear fighter docking bay capable of carrying two Halites, typically used to ship Halite fighters around Scin space to resupply carriers. Thanks to these fighters and the Epidotes' three dorsal turrets, they can also be used as a secondary warship when needed.`
	description `	Like other Gegno Scin ships, Epidotes themselves are an experimental test bed; they are built around the same large engine system tested on Feldspars, making them notably fast for their size.`

	description `Kyanites are intricately-built test platforms for Gegno Scin technology, equipped with an extensive built-in power system and energy reserve able to support many types of outfits. Weapon experimentation, the most common practice of Kyanites, is recorded by various scanner instruments littering the two long structures on the front of the hull. Despite being weapon research vessels, Kyanites are not combat-capable due to how exposed their systems are and how little hull covers them. These systems are also very expensive and difficult to produce, so only a small amount of Kyanites are found in service.`
	description `	The scanner system found on the Tridymite was originally developed and tested on Kyanite platforms, eventually becoming integrated into the hull as well.`
