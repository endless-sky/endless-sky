Acuit Artillery turrets outrange most weapons in Gegno space, while having a higher rate of fire as well, making them very efficient bombardment weapons.`

	description `The Guile Pulse Laser is a recent experimental advancement in Scin plasma weapon technology. Rather than rapid firing plasma slugs, this weapon fires concentrated pulses of energy that only last for a brief moment. Each blast impacts the target ship almost instantaneously with a powerful hit, and a consistent amount of fire from Guile Lasers is extremely effective against slow moving targets.`
	description `	Guile Pulse Lasers have noticeable drawbacks as they quickly consume energy and generate notable heat per shot. Unlike a beam-type weapon, they are incapable of consistent output, and have a fairly short range.`

	description `Burrower Drills are longer, thinner, and more precise than the larger Excavator Drill system, although they are nowhere near as powerful.

	description `Based on the RG-series Torch engine, Ion Torches are a unique type of utility mining weapon that focus the originally explosive exhaust into a thinner, more powerful flare. The more-controlled flame is akin to a heated blade allowing for more precise handling. In contrast to the Excavator, which aggressively grinds asteroids down, an Ion Torch can remove materials more accurately and safely from an asteroid. Additionally, the flare can be tuned down to serve as a makeshift reverse thruster.`

On the forward end are several long, sharp pikes that can easily pierce enemies, and on the rear end is a built-in cannon that can fire up to two explosive rounds. The cannon rounds are rarely used by the Vi unless they deem it absolutely necessary to defeat their foe or deal with unanticipated outside factors.`

	description `Miniaturizing ship-to-ship cannons and haphazardly shoving them into small makeshift barricades isn't exactly the safest way to install boarding defenses. Despite this, the hard-armored hulls of larger Gegno warships prove resilient enough to field Irate Carronades. Anyone, or anything, that unknowingly approaches a corridor where one is installed will likely become a new paint layer on the nearby walls.`

They are effective at clearing out large groups of enemies and are less of a hazard than unpredictable fragmentation grenades, allowing them to be a bit more reliable for defensive use. These grenades are kept in odd magnetic storage devices that prevent them from accidentally detonating - except on rare occasions.`
