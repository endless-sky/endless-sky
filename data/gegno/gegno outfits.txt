	description `The Guile Pulse Laser is a recent experimental advancement in Scin plasma weapon technology. Rather than rapid firing plasma slugs, this weapon fires concentrated pulses of energy that only last for a brief moment. Each blast impacts the target ship almost instantaneously with a powerful hit, and a consistent amount of fire from Guile Lasers is extremely effective against slow moving targets.` 
	description `	Guile Pulse Lasers have noticeable drawbacks as they quickly consume energy and generate notable heat per shot. Unlike a beam-type weapon, they are incapable of consistent output, and have a fairly short range.`

	description `A Savagery Bludgeon is a mace-like weapon found jammed into the Gegno Vi's Dunite duelist ships. They are used as melee weapons for close-quarter rams and jousts during duels. However, they barely have any use of a weapon outside of this as they merely scratch larger ship's hulls and barely put a dent into anything shielded.`
