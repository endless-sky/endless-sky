While waiting for something to appear, you look up and catch a glimpse of a cloud of dust bursting from the ground far off to your right. Peering back down to your radar, you check the surface scans of that direction, but nothing appears. As you continue your flight, another sudden dust cloud appears several minutes later, but still nothing on the radar. You decide to keep your ship a few thousand meters above the surface and take the time to carefully look around, but there still doesn't seem to be anything of note besides the cracked rock formations and valleys of sand.`

The dark-brown hull appears to be made from an unknown material, and has several metallic-looking parts both hatched in crevices and protruding outward. Oddly enough, the warship seems perfectly intact, but the way it is angled into the sand suggests that the ship has been there for some time. There doesn't seem to be any activity around it either. You decide to head back to your ship and take another look around the area.`

			`	Much to your surprise, there is a large humanoid figure standing where the signature originated from. Your radar showed something much less defined than a humanoid, but standing in front of you is a large, bulky being cladded in what looks like a form of metallic armor, wielding a spear-like weapon. The figure moves around attentively as if it is focused on its surroundings, but appears to take no interest in your presence. The encounter feels very odd in that there is no immediate interaction or acknowledgment of your existence.`

You take out your sidearm in a panic, but as you look back up at the alien figure, you notice that they too enter a defensive stance - but not towards you. A large maw bursts open in the sand to your left, and out of it comes a massive creature hundreds of times your size, covered in spikes and scales.

The flailing creature begins to get closer, and your pulse begins to race. A gust of sand blasts directly towards you, and once it clears you fire your weapon. A shot flies directly into the face of the beast.`
			`	Much to your dismay, the shot almost immediately ricochets off of it. You watch as the massive monster tumbles over you, just barely leaping into the air above. The monster plunges into the earth behind you, and you fall to your back with the wind knocked out of you. You raise your sidearm once more. The creature explodes out of the ground with its gaping mouth pointed upward to the sky. With shaking hands, you take aim once again and pull the trigger.`
			`	A loud, cannon-like bang follows, but it most certainly did not come from your weapon. The beast before you falls downward in a cloud of black smoke, blasting sand and rubble everywhere with a thud. Once you come to your senses, you see the alien marching out of the creature's mouth.`

Thick facial hair covers their face, and above their human-like eyes are a pair of horns curved inward towards you.`
			`	Awkward silence ensues, and the alien looks you up and down in an unenthused way. They emit a very deep grumble, and with a loud snort, reach into a crevice in their armor to grab something. Pulling out what looks to be some sort of star map, they point to a location on it, gesture to themselves, then lower the device slowly to you.

Such a pristine, advanced structure is quite the opposite of a disorderly industrial civilization. The population of Quarg here must be in the trillions, many times more than the population of the alien homeworld. What's even more interesting is that there are aliens of the kind you met before are here on the ring too. The Quarg must have some kind of relations with them, perhaps through trade, maintenance, or other services. Despite their presence, both they and the Quarg seem to be dismissive of one another. However, a few of the aliens occasionally glance over at you in some form of curiosity.`

After turning it back to you, you see both a green-colored patch and a brown-colored patch. "Vie," the Scin enunciates, pointing to the brown. "Sinn," they say, now pointing to the green. Afterwards, they point to the group of the three Gegno portraits. "Gegno."`
