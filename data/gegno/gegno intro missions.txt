			`As you descend towards the surface of this seemingly uninhabited world, you activate your ship's radar system to scan the surface for anything of interest. While waiting for something to appear, you look up and catch a glimpse of a cloud of dust bursting from the ground far off to your right. Peering back down to your radar, you check the surface scans of that direction, but nothing appears. As you continue your flight, another sudden dust cloud appears several minutes later, but still nothing on the radar. You decide to keep your ship a few thousand meters above the surface and take the time to carefully look around, but there still doesn't seem to be anything of note besides the cracked rock formations and valleys of sand.`
			`	Suddenly, your radar system picks up a larger signal on the horizon, and you see a bulky, rock-like structure. Once you get close enough, the structure begins to resemble a ship like ones you've seen flying around in the nearby systems, although it is half sunken into the sand.`

			`	You carefully land your ship nearby, exiting your ship in an environment suit with your sidearm on hand and walk towards the alien spacecraft. The ship appears a bit larger than you thought - around the size of a Firebird. The dark-brown hull appears to be made from an unknown material, and has several metallic-looking parts both hatched in crevices and protruding outward. Oddly enough, the warship seems perfectly intact, but the way it is angled into the sand suggests that the ship has been there for some time. There doesn't seem to be any activity around it either. You decide to head back to your ship and take another look around the area.`
			`	As you fly onward, an erratic signature on the surface appears on the edge of your radar. A large arch-like structure becomes visible in the distance, but disappears shortly after. You set your ship down close to the location and exit to investigate.`

			`	Much to your surprise, there is a large humanoid figure standing where the signature originated from. Your radar showed something much less defined than a humanoid, but standing in front of you is a large, bulky being cladded in what looks like a form of metallic armor, wielding a spear-like weapon. The figure moves around attentively as if it is focused on its surroundings, but appears to take no interest in your presence. The encounter feels very odd in that there is no immediate interaction or acknowledgment of your existence.`
			choice
				`	(Approach the alien.)`
				`	(Turn back to my ship.)`
			`	Suddenly, the ground starts to vibrate intensely. You take out your sidearm in a panic, but as you look back up at the alien figure, you notice that they too enter a defensive stance - but not towards you. A large maw bursts open in the sand to your left, and out of it comes a massive creature hundreds of times your size, covered in spikes and scales. You barely have time to react as it plummets onto the sand to your right, but you get a glimpse of the alien creature riding the beast as they impale it with their weapon.`

Instead of digging back under the surface, the beast continues to thrash about where it is while the alien batters it down with their spear weapon. Making sure you don't accidentally hit them, you hold your breath and wait until the right moment comes, aiming for the creature's head. The flailing creature begins to get closer, and your pulse begins to race. A gust of sand blasts directly towards you, and once it clears you fire your weapon. A laser shot flies directly into the face of the beast.`
			`	Much to your dismay, the shot almost immediately ricochets off of it. You watch as the massive monster tumbles over you, just barely leaping into the air above. The monster plunges into the earth behind you, and you fall to your back with the wind knocked out of you. You raise your sidearm once more. The creature explodes out of the ground with its gaping mouth pointed upward to the sky. With shaking hands, you take aim once again and pull the trigger.`
			`	A loud, cannon-like bang follows, but it most certainly did not come from your weapon. The beast before you falls downward in a cloud of black smoke, blasting sand and rubble everywhere with a thud. Once you come to your senses, you see the alien marching out of the creature's mouth.`

They are much taller than you, extremely bulky, and slightly hunched over. Heavy-looking metal surrounds their body, and in any exposed areas are rough-looking patches of skin and hair. Thick facial hair covers their face, and above their human-like eyes are a pair of horns curved inward towards you.`
			`	Awkward silence ensues, and the alien looks you up and down in an unenthused way. They emit a very deep grumble, and with a loud snort, reach into a crevice in their armor to grab something. Pulling out what looks to be some sort of star map, they point to a location on it, gesture to themselves, then lower the device slowly to you.

Their skin is a smooth, light gray, and adorned with different sorts of leather that remind you of medieval human clothing."
			`	The mood here is eerie as the Quarg here move in an unusually quiet manner. They are dismissive of the other species walking about, who are equally as dismissive of you. The strange atmosphere around you is finally broken when a few Quarg start to advance towards you, moving much quicker than the rest. After some unidentifiable discussion and gestures between themselves, one of them motions you to follow them.`

			`The visual of a complete Quarg Ringworld is drastically different than the Gegno homeworld you were on before. Such a pristine, advanced structure is quite the opposite of the disorderly industry of Gegno civilization. The population of Quarg here must be at least around the trillions, many times more than the population of the Gegno homeworld. What's even more interesting is there are other aliens of the kind you met before here on the ring too. The Quarg must have some kind of relations with them, perhaps through trade, maintenance, or other services. Despite them being present, the Quarg seem to be very dismissive of them. However, a few of the aliens occasionally glance over at you with hints of interest.`
			`	Soon enough, a few Quarg start to rush towards you much faster than the others and begin a conversation between themselves. You aren't sure what language they are speaking, but judging by the tones and pronunciations, it sounds similar to the one you've heard the aliens speaking before. After a moment or so, one of them motions you to follow them.`
			
			label "walking"
			`	You walk with the Quarg, occasionally having trouble keeping pace with their silent yet brisk steps, as you head towards an area that appears devoid of the other aliens. Eventually, you are led to a smaller room with two more Quarg in waiting, silently sitting at the end of it. They talk, but this time you can hear a few familiar sounding terms, one being "Huema". Despite speaking to each other for several minutes, the Quarg still look at each other in what you assume is something like bewilderment.`
			`	One of the Quarg waiting in the room finally turns towards you and motions you to take a seat. Its look of confusion disappears when they turn their gaze back upon you. Meanwhile, the other Quarg that was seated has left the room, along with the ones that first brought you here.`
			choice
				`	"Is there a problem?"`
			`	The Quarg continues to look at you and bows its head slightly in an apologetic manner, as it seems neither it, nor any other Quarg on this ringworld, can speak your language. You continue to patiently wait in the uneasy silence, withholding your curiosities as almost half an hour goes by.`
			`	Finally, the silence is broken when the second Quarg from earlier enters the room again. This time, it glares at you much more energetically, and you begin to wonder if your presence really is an issue.`

"This must be for you an exhilarating day, young traverser. I strongly imagine this is a first for both of us." It is now obvious that this Quarg is not the same one from earlier, and you begin to see a few differences in its attire and figure. The upbeat rhythm to their speech is not something you would expect of a Quarg.`
			choice
				`	"Where am I?"`

It seems that the Quarg are already aware of your encounter on the alien homeworld. In fact, thinking back to it, the looks of interest earlier by other aliens suggests that the word got spread quickly.

Rather, they glorify their pursuit of guidance between one another to share a noble future." You wonder if the Quarg's use of boastful adjectives is because of gaps in his translations, or if they are intentionally speaking that way. Its voice still comes from the lower tones of Quarg speech, clashing with the excited pace it is speaking at.`

Although, you are appreciably welcome at this ring should you find yourself here again."`
