Eventually, you come across a large Gegno Vi vessel stationed on the surface, though unlike in your prior encounter, the ship isn't sunken into the desert - it has likely landed here recently. A group of Vi warriors are marching out and nearby the vessel, and while they do, your radar picks up two more ships descending from above.`

It looks like some sort of interceptor vessel, though it is definitely larger than something like a Sparrow from human space, maybe even the size of a Headhunter. Perhaps that ship belongs to someone of importance.`

Unlike the Scin's warships you confronted a few days ago, which were more reactive to your presence than direct about it, the Vi here are now going out of their way to approach your ship.

The Gegno seems to ask a question in their language, but receives no response. Adrauni pauses a while longer before speaking again. "Despite that, you have found yourself in precarious situations we have not. We as a species embraced contact with the Gegno; however, you remain the only human here. Perhaps therein lies a notable implication of distinction."`

If it weren't as such, I may not be the one speaking with you in this moment. Or, perhaps, it would be no one." It then looks forward again as you continue on your stroll, leaving you to think on those words. "Unfortunately, the Quarg are unable to further assist you in this delicate matter. If you recall, we have attempted prior counsel with the Gegno, yet bound they are in their ways, even should it mean incredulously opposing us Quarg."`

Many times I have said this, that the Gegno are not what I would consider humans to possess knowledge of. Should you learn more, I'm afraid even then that the Gegno do not contrastingly desire, what was the human word - camaraderie?" The Gegno then asks something in their language, and Adrauni begins a somewhat lengthy conversation with them.`

			`	The Quarg turns back to you. "You are here not at the whim of your fanatic species, but at your own behest. Actions you take may be that of a human, but are not willed by that of humanity." Blinking slowly, Adrauni then turns to the Gegno walking besides it and begins a somewhat lengthy conversation with them.`

A few moments later, you eventually begin following Adrauni and the Gegno down what appears to be a different section, though it is strangely wider than previous ones. Before you begin asking more questions, Adrauni finally replies. "It is apparent that you may understand something of your fragile circumstance. It is no longer what I, rather, the Quarg, can do for you. It is what you can do for yourself."`

You are at the end of your seemingly long trip through the ringworld, finding yourself back where you started - the docking facility where your ship is stationed. Although it felt like a dizzying maze to follow Adrauni around back to here, you can't help but imagine how much more confusing it would be to explore the entirety of a ringworld, considering that was only several minutes worth. Adrauni stops and turns to you, slightly lowering itself to speak closer to your own height. "You must seek audience on your own, tenacious, behalf. Visit the Gegno homeworld of Dueyu Eitch, present yourself in a manner that you desire to be perceived. Only then will you find your desired answer."`

Imagine if the Quarg visited your own planet called Earth with strange others in tow." You guess that Adrauni then does what the Quarg equivalent of a sigh would be.

As you return to your ship, a few other Quarg, who have been watching the conversation from afar, also return to their normal routine as if nothing had happened. Now, it is up to you to see for yourself whether or not the Gegno will accept you.`

They have the hulking appearance of Vi warriors, and while they aren't moving from their position, they watch you intently as you exit your ship. A small group of Quarg then approach you and quickly motion you to follow them, escorting you through various halls of the ring. Eventually you are led to the room where you met Adrauni in the past, or perhaps one identical to it. "Please, seat yourself."`

Should the Gegno, or species of other eccentricities, be given leisure to your planet Earth? It may be the case with you, though with anxious humanity, it certainly would not be."

The other Quarg in the room look at Adrauni strangely, after which it begins a conversation with them in their own language.

It looks up in thought for several moments. "Perhaps in your naive judgment I am mistaken. Humans tolerate their own undesirables, those who have come to be known as corsairs. Portions of your species permit their tiresome actions, while others do not. Be that as it may, suppose a species other than humanity begins similar agitation.

I had the slightest hope you understood my preachings of nonviolence, as I believe there to be benefit from optimistic aspirations in younger species, but ultimately my hopes are proven unfounded." Some of the other Quarg in the room abruptly address Adrauni as if you weren't present and begin a long period of debate, occasionally punctuated by glares in your direction.`

In our discussions with you, evident it is that this has proven to be true. However, the great bounds stepped beyond here go beyond what we are able to accommodate." Adrauni then changes its expression slightly, glowering at you again. "Particularly after continual warnings prior."

Once you return to the hangar, you're greeted by the sight of the Vi warriors being blocked off by a larger group of Quarg, although there doesn't seem to be any intentions of hostility, nor conversation, from either side.

Everything looks rocky and sculpted in appearance, although some entrances seem to be made of newer metallic materials.`
			`	You wonder if all Gegno architecture is built like this, but your curiosity is cut short when the Gegno, who has been many steps ahead of you, grunts and gestures for you to enter a cage-like platform at the other side of an enormous room.`
			choice
				`	(Enter the cage.)`
			`	Thankfully, the cage is not anything like a jail cell; with a clank of chains and other indeterminate sounds, you begin to ascend upwards to wherever your next destination may be. However, the shaking and clanging of the lift doesn't exactly ease your mind. All of a sudden, you start to hear a deep, methodical rumble coming from above you. In that same instant, you're hit with a gust of air. Your cage is outside the building, and it is rocketing upward with only the support of a few rails and pulleys. Surrounding the core of the tower in front of you are other large metal pulley systems, with the Gegno in one to your left in the distance. As you're ascending, you see that many Gegno are lined up on several balconies at different levels of the tower, playing large timpani-like drums in a steady rhythm. Occasionally they yell or play a horn-like instrument.`
			`	A few more minutes of drumming, several layers of smog, and what feels like altitude sickness all assail you until the lift arrives at the very top of the tower - a huge, circular platform out in the open with a group of Gegno wearing various fashions of armor formed up around a large table, or display grid of sorts, with several models of planets and ships on top of it. A ring of electronic torches flanking each edge of the platform extends upward to the darkened sky.`
			`	The Gegno that has guided you here gestures for you to go join them at their location among the others.`
			choice
				`	(Go to the Gegno.)`

			`	It's not long before a pair of Gegno soldiers walk over and essentially "pressure" you into joining the others. You might as well play by their rules, given the situation.`

			label meeting
			`	Once you reach the other Gegno, the drumming comes to an abrupt halt. Shown in the center of the display is some text, none of which you can understand. Three Gegno standing next to one another, separate from everyone else, begin speaking in low, booming voices; their language is incomprehensible. One is very bulky, and looks like the kind of Gegno that belong to the Vi faction, while the other two are smaller. All three of them are wearing the same set of intricate armor with fancy protrusions, drapes, and other details. All of the other Gegno present are of various builds, though none of them are wearing any colors indicating a faction. Some of them gaze toward you occasionally, while others pay you no attention at all.`
			`	The awkwardness of the situation increases as several minutes pass, during which some Gegno from the crowd step up to the opposite side of the table from the trio and have a discussion. You look over to your Gegno guide standing next to you, their gaze locked on to the conversations ahead. One of the trio finally calls them over, placing a model of a desert planet on the table - the one where this all started. A heavy discussion follows, and while you watch your guide, you realize that they are the only Gegno with that red band on their arm. The other Gegno in the crowd don't seem very pleased as their discussion continues.`
			`	Though it felt like it might not happen, the moment comes where the bulkiest of the trio directly gestures to you. The tension of the situation skyrockets as they say something in their language, then motion for you to stand across from them. All of the other Gegno are now staring you down, waiting, as your guide heads off to the side.`
			choice
				`	(Approach the trio.)`
					goto trio
				`	(Remain where you stand.)`

			`	You choose not to do anything else, remaining where you stand. Anything you do would likely be held against you. Another few moments go by and the Gegno trio return to the table, beginning to discuss amongst themselves using the assorted objects on the table grid. Images and words are cycled through on the monitor, but you're too far away to see any of them. Several more minutes pass, and you feel like they've all but forgotten you as you start to tune out their discussion. Eventually, you're pulled back to reality; everything has gone silent yet again and one member of the Gegno trio calls to you to get your attention on the display.`

Following another brief moment of silence, one which seemingly everyone weathers with anticipation, one of the three addresses you in their language at a lower volume than they were speaking before.`

Alongside it are many graphics - one representing a platoon of Vi warriors, the unique Gegno ship you saw there, and a few words scrolling by, possibly the names of each warrior that was present that day. Next to the name of the planet is a smaller graphic of one of those giant sandworms you fought, suggesting that they're found on other desert worlds beyond the first one.`

Oddly enough, you feel as if you are standing among them as part of the gathering, rather than as some foreign alien. You aren't restricted at all, even with a weapon on you.`

You still don't understand a word they are saying, but it must have been important, as all of the other Gegno except your guide back away several steps.

At the same time, you gesture using your hands, mainly representing your ship flying "away". You wonder if anything makes any sense to the Gegno, but they don't seem to be paying attention to your words or actions themselves; rather, they seem to respond to the tone and emotion of them.

Despite the grandiose nature of the Gegno's one and only space station, it seems very old and inactive. As you are escorted around the spacious interior, of which a majority is only a skeletal frame of pipes, bars, and supportive structures, you see a noticeable lack of personnel and running machinery. Some sections aren't even properly pressurized, but thankfully your spacesuit makes up for it. Occasionally, you come across some workers, but they appear very lethargic, or maybe just unmotivated.`
