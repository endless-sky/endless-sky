	description "Skirmish batteries are very common amongst ships across Gegno space. They can be either a perfectly convenient storage of battery power to offset the load of larger Gegno generators, or a nice addition to add on top of them where more energy would be needed."

	description "Battlezone batteries are primarily used on the Gegno's medium-range combat vessels, holding a decent amount of power for long lasting engagements. They also fit nicely on larger vessels as an extra power source to feed their larger systems."

	description "Warforge batteries have proved their usefulness over the years as large, sturdy battery packs. They support the equally large volleys that are fired from Gegno ships, and help maintain an excess of power for engine usage."

	description "As the largest battery mounted on Gegno ships, the Crusade Battery supplies almost enough power as a small generator, enough to support the massive warships of both the Scin and the Vi. However, they fall under the capacity of similarly-sized human batteries due to inefficient handling of their scale."

	description "The Scrap Cell is a small radiothermal generator that produces energy generation in a pinch that abusing the Gegno's slightly hotter running tech. Its output is very limited, and is only used in tandem with the Gegno's smaller-sized systems."

	description "C7 Brawl Cores are a slight deviation from the other C class cores as it is set upright-forward. It is a more rudimentary type of radiothermal reactor than the C3, but nevertheless produces the necessary power for the ships that typically carry one."

	description "As did humans, the Gegno began developing nuclear technology once their cities grew massive enough to require it. The Warzone Core is a medium-sized nuclear fission reactor that is a suitable power source for most of the Gegno's large ships, though it looks even more discomforting than a human one."

	description "In order to power the largest of vessels along with their power-guzzling systems and engines, the Gegno designed the Campaign Fusion Reactor from earlier prototypes during their colony ship era. It's still used to this day and is as efficient as one warship needs it to be, but just looking at it still raises concerns."

	description "Due to need of a smaller, more compact power system for a fighter design, the I70 Cell was designed by the Scin to be fitted on their Halite fighters. It has a small energy capacity to fuel the Scin's diminutive thrusters, and is able to power their weapons with a minor but acceptable energy generation. Unfortunately, as a side effect, a bit more unwanted heat is also generated."
