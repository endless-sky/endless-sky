	description "Skirmish batteries are very common amongst ships across Gegno space. They are a perfectly convenient storage of battery power to offset the load of larger Gegno generators, or a nice addition to add on top of them where more energy would be needed."

	description "Battlezone batteries are primarily used on the Gegno's medium-range combat vessels, holding a decent amount of power for long lasting engagements. They also fit nicely on larger vessels as an extra power source to feed their larger systems."

	description "Warforge batteries have proved their usefulness over the years. As large, sturdy battery packs, they assist with equally large vollies that are fired from Gegno ships, and help maintain an excess of power for engine usage."

	description "As the largest battery mounted on Gegno ships, the Crusade Battery supplies almost enough power as a mini generator. They are enough to support the massive warships of both the Scin and the Vi, however are slightly under the capacity of similar human batteries due to inefficient handling of their scale."

	"outfit space" -25
	description "The Scrap Cell is a small radiothermal generator that produces energy generation in a pinch, making use of the Gegno's slightly hotter running tech. It's output is very limited, and is only used in tandem with the Gegno's smaller-sized systems."

	description "C7 Brawl Cores are a slight deviation from the other C class cores as it is set upright-forward. It is a more rudimentary type of radiothermal reactor than the C3, but nevertheless produces the necessary power for the ships that carry typically carry one."

	"outfit space" -87
	description "The Gegno, as did humans, began developing nuclear technology once their cities grew massive enough. The Warzone Core is a medium-sized nuclear fission reactor that is a suitable power source for most of the Gegno's large ships, though it looks even more discomforting than a human one."

	"outfit space" -145
	description "In order to power the largest of vessels along with their power-guzzling systems and engines, the Gegno designed the Campaign Fusion Reactor from earlier prototypes during the colony ship era. It's still used to this day and is as efficient as one warship needs it to be, but just looking at it still raises concerns.."

	"outfit space" -20
	description "Due to the needs of a smaller, more compact power system for a fighter design, the I70 Cell was designed by the Scin to be fitted on their Halite fighters. It has a small energy capacity to fuel the small but quick thrusters of one, and is able to power their weapons with a small but notable energy generation. Unfortunately, as a side effect, a bit more unwanted heat is also generated."
