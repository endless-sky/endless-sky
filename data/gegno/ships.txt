	description "Due to the Gegno splitting up and colonizing new worlds, they needed a smaller ship to do a lot of the grunt work instead of always relying on their enormous (and expensive) City-Ships. The Shale is the Gegno's design of a shuttle-ship, small and compact with transportation being its single purpose. Whether it be cargo, trade goods, travellers, or recruits to move off homeworld, Slates build the foundations of the Gegno."

	description "Almost as large as a human cruiser, Dolomites are the Gegno's most common jack-of-all-trades cargo vessel in service, having been used since the early days of colonization. They are used as both passenger liners and cargo vessels, and carry decent amounts of both to note. Due to its popularity and continuous usage, both of the Gegno Vi and Gegno Scin factions have developed further on the original design for their own purposes."

	description "To fuel their exponentionally increasing construction rate and need for materials, many Miner-class ships were devised for space usage. Rather than re-use older ship designs, Miners would be designed to focus only on the purpose of mining. The Gypsum platform is not much more than a flying drill with cargo containers, engines, and a bridge attached behind it, making it cost-efficient and easily manufacturable."
	description `Compared to other vessels in the galaxy, the Gypsum is much slower due to the Gegno's technology level, and has a harder time keeping up with faster asteroids. For those asteroids it can catch up to, the powerful excavator drill is able to grind materials out with ease.`

	description "The Schist is the Gegno Vi's variation of the Gegno's old mid-range Dolomite. It has a decent cargo size, and enough bunks to carry a whole platoon of Gegno warriors. It is the primary vessel used to transport recruits to the front lines, and veterans back to home territories." 
	description `Although a relatively light armament is an exception for the Vi's very aggressive and combat-oriented ship design philosophy, Schists still carry a pair of cannon mounts to be able to bring something, rather than nothing, to a fight.`

	description "Hornfels are the workhorse of the Gegno Vi's military. They're decently sized, decently fast, and more than decently armed in order to be able to fight on their own. Because the Gegno Vi always require more replacement supplies in war, they double as a secondary cargo transport as well, and are seen occasionally with cargo pods attached to the several racks lining the sides of the ship."

	description "Gneiss Battleships are the Gegno Vi's true sword & shield in war.

Gniesses also have extremely strong armor plating, and can take a hefty beating while firing dangerously threatening broadsides at the opposing force."

It is ever so slightly smaller for the slightly shorter Scin, but carries newer engine systems that almost double the speed of both the Shale and the Slate. Combined with the speed and the room for a few more Scin, it is a relatively faster option for a captain looking for a shuttlecraft in Gegno space."

	description "Using a similar yet smaller frame to the Coesite, the Tridymite was designed as the production platform for the Gegno Scin's new Guile system. As its younger sibling, the Tridymite is a smaller escort vessel that provides anti-cannon screening for Scin fleets, while Coesites are armed with more offensive weaponry."

	description "Felsics are essentially stripped Schists repurposed for a more engaging role. In place of the heavier engines that the Vi had mounted on, they expanded the profile have more efficient engines, dedicating the remaining space to a larger cargo capacity. On top of fitting more cargo room, the Scin also oufitted these 3 turret mounts, allowing them to double as a secondary combat vessel to support their war efforts, and to fill in the lack of a dedicated warship."

	description "The mighty Feldspar is a Scin creation to behold. As a testbed for the new Halite Fighters, Feldspars bring their own small fleets with them and overwhelm their enemy. They also were designed as a semi-experimental platform, built around a brand new multi-engine system and the latest in Gegno plasma technology."
	description `Able to keep a decent stance away from a battle while putting down artillery fire, Feldspars are quite a dangerously well-rounded ship for their size. On the downside, they are more susceptible to hull damage like any other Scin warship, especially when alone, as they rely a lot on their fighters since they aren't a dedicated warship themselves.`

	description "Since Protoliths were largely acquired by the Vi before spaceship developmented progressed too far, the Scin had to design a brand new heavy freighter vessel from scratch. The Muscovite is able to perform in many roles, having a very large crew capability and cargo capacity."
	description `Each Muscovite is also equipped with a rear fighter bay capable of carrying a Halite, allowing the Scin to transport fighters to outposts that need them for Feldspars. Like the Felspar, the Muscovite is also equipped with a brand new engine system, making a ship that can take a bit of a pounding faster as well.`
