	description "Because the Gegno began splitting up and colonizing new worlds, they needed a smaller ship to do a lot of the grunt work instead of always relying on ther enourmous (and expensive) City-Ships. The Shale is the Gegno's design of a shuttle-ship, small and compact with the single purpose as a transport vessel, whether it be cargo, trade goods, travellers, or recruits to move off homeworld to pursue the efforts of the Vi and the Scin."

	description "Almost as large as a human cruiser, Dolomites are the Gegno's most common jack-of-all-trades cargo vessel in service, having been used since the early days of colonization. They are used as both passenger liners and cargo vessels, and carry decent amounts of both to note. Due to its popularity and continuous usage, both of the Gegno Vi and Gegno Scin factions have developed further on the original design for their own purposes."

	description "The Slate is the Gegno Vi's variation of the Shale, taking the original design, adding bulkier systems and space more trademarked to the Vi. Slightly larger than a normal shuttleship to suit the Vi's stature, it's able to carry more than a few Gegno cadets along with a small cargo load."

	description "The Schist is the Gegno Vi's variation of the Gegno's old mid-range Dolomite. It has a decent cargo size, and enough bunks to carry a whole squadron of Gegno warriors. It is the premire vessel to transport recruits to the frontlines, and veterans back to the homeworld. Although an exception to the Vi's very aggressive and combat-oriented ship design, Schists still carry a pair of cannons to bring something to a fight."

	description "Hornfels are the powerhorse of the Gegno Vi's military. They're decently sized, decently fast, and armed more than decently to be able to fight on their own. Because the Gegno Vi are always requiring more replacement supplies in war, they double as a secondary cargo transport as well, and are seen occasionally with cargo pods attached to the several racks lining the sides of the ship."

	description "Gneiss Battleships are the Gegno Vi's true sword & shield in war. They are slightly older than the Hornfels and Schists, but carry the heaviest armament, bolstering 3 mounts dedicated to Ballisic Cannons. Gniesses also have extremely strong armor plating, and can take a hefty beating while firing dangerously threatening broadsides at the opposing force. Unfortunately, for exchange of huge firepower and defensive armor, they lack speed and maneuverability, even when fitted with the largest engine systems the Vi have to offer."

	description "Halites are a double-first for the Gegno. They are the Gegno Scin's newest ship design, and are the Gegno's first fighter-based craft. They are also the first Gegno ships equipped with early-stage beam weapon technology, with almost half the hull dedicated to it. Able to fly around the Gegno Vi's slower projectile techology, Halites are able to bring a swarm of instant damage to the slow-moving Vi warships, making them hard to deal with in numbers."

It is ever so slightly smaller for the slightly shorter Scin, but carries newer engine systems that almost double the speed of either the Shale, or the Gegno Vi's Slate. Combined with the speed and the room for a few more Scin, it is the relatively faster option of a shuttlecraft in Gegno space."

They also double as a semi-experimental platform, carrying a brand new multi-engine system and the latest in Gegno plasma technology. Able to keep a decent stance away from a battle while still putting down fire, Feldspars are quite a dangerous well-rounded ship for their sizem but are susceptible to hull damage as any other Scin ship."

	description "Since Protoliths were largely acquired by the Vi before spaceship developmented progressed too far, the Scin had to design a brand new heavy freighter vessel from scratch. The Muscovite is able to perform in many roles, having a very large crew capability and cargo capacity. Each Muscovite is also equipped with a rear fighter bay capable of carrying a Halite, allowing the Scin to transport fighters to outposts that need them for Feldspars. Like the Felspar, the Muscovite is also equipped with a brand new engine system, making a ship that can take a bit of a pounding faster as well."
