	description "Irate Cannons are a rudimentary cannon technology that fire explosive projectiles made out of condensed energy and metal, making them effective against armor. They fire decently fast, but one cannon alone is barely enough to output any sort of meaningful damage, which is why they are often found clustered together in numbers."

	description "A caliber higher than the Irate Cannon, Chloeric cannons fire larger, slower rounds that do a noticable chunk of damage to a ship's hull. However, due to the nature of the cannon (as well as its sister cannons), it is very inneffective against any sort of shielding."

	description "Mounted on a turret a Chloeric Cannon is much more devastating without the need to line up the ship for a shot. It can consistently put out damage to a target's hull, and with multiple turrets, threatean any shieldless vessel to retreat after a long enough bombardment."

	description "The Gegno Ballistic Cannon is one of the largest cannons you've ever seen. It even requires its own vented system on the gun itself, and the huge turret mount is necessary for one of these cannons to even be fitted on a ship. The shells a Ballistic Cannon fire can almost be equated to that of explosive rockets. They deal tremendous hull damage, however they are lethargic, and are still much less effective against anything shielded."

	description "The Gegno Scin are the first Gegno to advance pure plasma technology far enough to use it in combat. Asuit Batteries are very similar to how human Energy Blasters work- they fire small condensed plasma projectles at high rates of fire. With 4 on a turreted mount, it is a constant stream of damage being laid upon a target, and although each shot does not do very much, consistent fire on the same target adds up. However, energy usage adds up just as much."

	description "Unlike the humans, the Gegno Scin were able to progress beam technology much earlier in their timeline, with experiment after experiment leading up to the Talc Laser. Although the damage is no where near as impressive as humanity's beam lasers, a consistent source of damage is notably effecting against the slow moving ships of the Gegno Vi."

	description "With a better grasp on plasma and energy weaponry, the Gegno Scin developed a larger blaster weapon to mount on the Feldspar Carrier as a counter to the Gegno's huge cannon weaponry. The Acuit Artillery Cannon outranges most weapons in Gegno space, and has a rate of fire higher than most other weapons, making it a very efficient bombardment weapon."

	description "Although the Gegno have yet to create space-rated engine systems small enough to support rocket and missile technology, the Scin developed a type of anti-missile system based on their new beam technology that began a new arms race. Guiles are able to predict the trajectory of a Vi cannon shell, as well as any other similar projectile-based weapons, and eliminate that much more damage."
