#ifndef ATTRIBUTE_CATEGORY_H_
#define ATTRIBUTE_CATEGORY_H_

// Defines groupings for attributes. Many of these are situations when outfit effects are applied to a ship.
// The first couple entries (until CLOAKING) define the same effect as the first couple entries of AttributeEffect,
// and can be used as a shortcut in the data format.
// Categories are also generated programmatically. For any category C and effect E,
// C + ATTRIBUTE_CATEGORY_COUNT * (E + 1)
// denotes a special category that is combined with the effect. This is primarily used for RESISTANCE, where
// categories such as "burn resistance" are created this way.
