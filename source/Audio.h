// This class is a collection of global functions for handling audio. A sound
// can be played from any point in the code, and from any thread, just by
// specifying the name of the sound to play. Most sounds will come from a
// "source" at a certain position, and their volume and left / right balance is
// adjusted based on how far they are from the observer. Sounds that are not
// marked as looping will play once, then stop; looping sounds continue until
// their source stops calling the "play" function for them.
