// sell is available to be bought again until you close this panel, even if it
// is not normally sold here. You can also directly install any outfit that you
// have plundered from another ship and are storing in your cargo bay. This
// panel makes an attempt to ensure that you do not leave with a ship that is
// configured in such a way that it cannot fly (e.g. no engines or steering).
