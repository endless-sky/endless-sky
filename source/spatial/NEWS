Spatial NEWS
============

	* The new library is out on this very day. A bit of documentation has
	been done, but there are still some missing unit tests and important
	parts of the documentation missing. The roadmap for spatial is much more
	ambitious that the current release: self-balancing trees to complete,
	adding boxset family of containers, and then turning all this into
	intrusive containers, plus each time, more documentation and unit
	tests. New iterators should also appear, mainly to work with boxset
	family of containers.
