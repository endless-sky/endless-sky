Spatial Installation Instruction
================================

Compilers and Options
---------------------

There is no compilation options linked with this library at the
moment. This library is a header-only library and does not require
compilation.


Installation For Linux
----------------------

Spatial is a header-only library, and all you have to do is to copy
these headers in the appropriate header directory for your
project. Generally, you must copy the contents of the 'src' folder in
a folder named 'spatial' on your computer. You can now use the library
for your project by including in the source file:

#include "spatial/poinset.hpp"

If you are using the library for several projects and you want the
library to reside in a different directory from your projects, such as
'/usr/local/include/', just copy the 'src' folder of the library in
there and rename it to 'spatial'. You can now use the library for your
project by including in the source file:

#include <spatial/poinset.hpp>


Installation For Visual Studio
------------------------------

If you are using the library for multiple shared projects and you wish
to upgrade to subsequent versions of the library, you can copy the
'src' folder in any directory that you find suitable, rename it to
'spatial', and add that directory in the 'Additional Include
Directories' of the 'General', 'C/C++' properties of
your project.

If you wish to install the library in one of the default include
directories of Visual Studio, then copy the content of the 'src'
folder into:

%Visual Studio location%\VC\include\

Rename the folder to 'spatial' and you're good to go.


Installation For Other Platforms
--------------------------------

Copy the directory 'src' and its content to the default C++ header
location for your compilation environement. Rename it to 'spatial'.
You can now use the library for your project by including in the
source file:

#include <spatial/pointset.hpp>

Or copy the directory 'src' and its content to your own project
and rename it to 'spatial'. You can now use the library by including in
the source file:

#include "spatial/pointset.hpp"
