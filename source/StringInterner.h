// This class stores a set of interned strings. Interning can be a slow operation during string creation/interning, but
// it will allow fast char-pointer based comparisons when comparing two interned strings (because interning ensures that
// each interned string only appears once in the set). Full string compares will still be needed when comparing interned
// strings to non-interned strings.
