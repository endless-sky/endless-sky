	description "The Heavy Barrage cannon is an extremely long-range weapon capable of barraging Capital ships with devastating volleys. Its range excels against most other weapons, and with enough of these in your fleet, they can quickly take out fleets of Capital warships. Its big weaknesses is its turning rate, firing velocity, and firing rate, allowing quicker ships to evade it easily. Instead of a weapon that could lay down consistent fire, the engineers turned this weapon into a support weapon."
	description "This weapon works using a long-range shell with two fuses. The first fuse explodes out of the shell, crippling the enemy ship. The second fuse hits the ship's hull directly. These fuse explosions have a small blast radius which has been known to hit friendly ships caught in the blast zone, so this weapon is only meant to be used as an initiator."

	description "This large turret fires explosive shells at a moderate rate, and can punch through light and medium armour. Against the heaviest ships, this turret doesn't do too much damage, but combined with its successor, the Tethys Cannon, the amount of firepower this turret throws at the target is terrifying."

	description "This light anti-fighter turret is a baseplate mount that can either be manned or automated by the computer. It fires explosive shells that split into dozens of shrapnel shards that pepper the area around the target, often hitting other targets as well. Against larger ships, the smaller pieces of shrapnel don't do quite so much damage, and direct hits from the explosive shells don't do much damage either."
