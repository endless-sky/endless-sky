# Endless Sky

Explore other star systems. Earn money by trading, carrying passengers, or completing missions. Use your earnings to buy a better ship or to upgrade the weapons and engines on your current one. Blow up pirates. Take sides in a civil war. Or leave human space behind and hope to find some friendly aliens whose culture is more civilized than your own...

------

Endless Sky is a sandbox-style space exploration game similar to Elite, Escape Velocity, or Star Control. You start out as the captain of a tiny spaceship and can choose what to do from there. The game includes a major plot line and many minor missions, but you can choose whether you want to play through the plot or strike out on your own as a merchant or bounty hunter or explorer.

See the [player's manual](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/PlayersManual) for more information, or the [home page](https://endless-sky.github.io/) for screenshots and the occasional blog post.

## Building from source
Most development is done on Linux and Windows, using the [SCons](https://scons.org/) build tool to compile the project. For those wishing to use an IDE, project files are provided for [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and [Code::Blocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/) to simplify the project setup. It is possible to use other IDEs or build systems to compile the game, but support is not provided.
For full installation instructions, consult the [Build Instructions](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/blob/master/readme-developer.md) readme.

# Contributing
As a free and open source game, Endless Sky is the product of many peoples' work. Contributions of artwork, storylines, and other writing are most in-demand, though there is a loosely defined [roadmap](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/DevelopmentRoadmap). Those who wish to [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md) are encouraged to review the [wiki](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki), and to post in the [community-run discord](https://discord.gg/ZeuASSx) beforehand. Those who prefer to use Steam can use its [discussion rooms](https://steamcommunity.com/app/404410/discussions/) as well. For those who do not wish to use either discord or steam, we do have access to [github discussions](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/discussions), although these are quite new and don't have a lot of traffic yet.

Endless Sky's main discussion and development area was once [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/g/endless-sky), but due to factors outside our control, it is now inaccessible to new users.
