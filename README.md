# Endless Sky

Explore other star systems. Earn money by trading, carrying passengers, or completing missions. Use your earnings to buy a better ship or to upgrade the weapons and engines on your current one. Blow up pirates. Take sides in a civil war. Or leave human space behind and hope to find some friendly aliens whose culture is more civilized than your own...

------

Endless Sky is a sandbox-style space exploration game similar to Elite, Escape Velocity, or Star Control. You start out as the captain of a tiny space ship and can choose what to do from there. The game includes a major plot line and many minor missions, but you can choose whether you want to play through the plot or strike out on your own as a merchant or bounty hunter or explorer.

See the [player's manual](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/PlayersManual) for more information, or the [home page](https://endless-sky.github.io/) for screenshots and the occasional blog post.

### Building from source
While most development is done on Linux using the [SCons](https://scons.org/) build tool to compile the project, IDE-specific files are provided for [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/) to simplify the installation on Mac OS and Windows. It is possible to use other IDEs or build systems to compile the game, but support is not provided.
For full installation instructions, consult the [Build Instructions](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/BuildInstructions) wiki page.
