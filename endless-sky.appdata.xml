    <p>Explore other star systems. Earn money by trading, carrying passengers, or completing missions. Use your earnings to buy a better ship or to upgrade the weapons and engines on your current one. Blow up pirates. Take sides in a civil war. Or leave human space behind and hope to find some friendly aliens whose culture is more civilized than your own...</p>
    <p>Endless Sky is a sandbox-style space exploration game similar to Elite, Escape Velocity, or Star Control. You start out as the captain of a tiny space ship and can choose what to do from there. The game includes a major plot line and many minor missions, but you can choose whether you want to play through the plot or strike out on your own as a merchant or bounty hunter or explorer.</p>

      <description>
        <p>This is an unstable release, containing big changes that may introduce new bugs.</p>
        <p>Breaking changes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Starting conditions no longer automatically override the game's default start. Plugins that use a "start" node will need to make changes to restore the previous behavior.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Major new changes include the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>70+ new missions in human and alien space</li>
          <li>Outfits can now be stored on planets, without needing to install them on a parked ship</li>
          <li>An overhaul of almost all human outfit images</li>
          <li>Players can now choose their starting scenario</li>
          <li>Spaceport news messages no longer include portraits by default</li>
          <li>Better handling for missing content definitions (e.g. from plugin removal)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Several features have been added to the game engine, for use by plugins and other content creators.</p>
        <p>These include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Dynamic stopover selection will consider planets without spaceports</li>
          <li>A number of new outfit and weapon attributes, offering shield/hull multipliers, weapon aiming &amp; firing overrides, percentage-based damage, and additional damage mitigation</li>
          <li>Arbitrary angles for hardpoints, engine flares, and fighter bays</li>
          <li>NPCs' objectives can now include provocation or capture</li>
          <li>Mission NPCs can be conditionally spawned or removed without needing to change the player's active missions</li>
          <li>Missions can react differently when the player aborts a mission, and when the player fails a mission</li>
          <li>Missions can give ships to the player</li>
          <li>Systems may generate environmental hazards, control the range at which ships enter, and be hidden on the map</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition to the major changes above, there are lots of smaller changes, content additions, and (of course) countless bug and typo fixes.</p>
        <p>Thanks to all of our contributors for their time and effort in making Endless Sky a community-driven project!</p>
