Good to meet you in person. Please, sit," he says, gesturing to the chair next to you before taking a seat behind his desk. "We'll get right to it. As you might know, the nuclear detonation on Geminus means we're... well, stretched thin. We've been hiring contractors to fill gaps in our manpower, and you've proved you're reliable. To my understanding, you have some experience traveling through the Far North after your scouting work with Commander Melgrew. Is that correct?"`

I've prepared a few agents disguised as colonists to infiltrate the planet and arrest the pirate, but I've hit a roadblock: transportation. Any port authority would never let a Navy ship land, so I need an alternative form of transportation. That's where you come in. Take the 'colonists' to Freedom, bribe the authorities with the credits I'll provide, wait for them to bring their 'friend' back, then return here to <origin>. Questions?"`

			`	"Well... not directly. There are two potential rewards. First, if you have any leftover bribe money, you can keep it. The funding's one of those 'spend it or lose it' situations, so I really don't mind. Second, if you perform well on this mission, I may have future work lined up with more concrete rewards. For the time being, I need to see how you do before I decide spending more money is worth it. Any more questions?"`

			`	After a couple of hours, the group returns, leading a woman in cuffs to the ship. She can't be more than twenty years old, but the death stare she gives you would be no more intimidating if it had come from someone twice her size. "We got what we came for. Please return to <origin> as soon as possible," the lead agent says to you.`

You should expect to join combat missions against them, but how much you do will depend on our resources and your own skills."`
