      * The banker from the intro conversation now provides the exact amount of interest that will be paid for the loan instead of rounding to the nearest 1,000 credits. (@ziproot)
      * The game now remembers which Deep Security ships you destroyed in "Deep Archaeology 3", and doesn't spawn them in "Deep Archaeology 5" if they died. (@ziproot)

    * Broke the user preferences up into multiple pages. (@Terin)

    * Replaced the mouse control toggle button with a preference to prevent accidental activations. (@samrocketman)
    * Added a preference to toggle whether the flagship will collect flotsams. (@TomGoodIdea)

    * The autofire preference can now be limited to only guns or only turrets. (@TomGoodIdea)
    * Added a new control to auto-aim your ship toward your target when a key is pressed, default "E". Usable as an alternative to having the auto-aim setting always on. (@ChamEV, @UnorderedSigh)
    * Only scan messages that are considered important will now be displayed. Important scan messages are when you are being scanned, or an escort with illegal cargo is being scanned. (@TomGoodIdea)
    * Controls can now be unbound by pressing X or delete when hovering over the control. (@Koranir)
    * Reordered settings in the settings menu to more sensibly group related settings. (@warp-core)

    * Refactored and improved the shop's handling of purchasing errors. (@alextd, @warp-core)

    * Moved the storage of save file information from your conditions to dedicated storage locations, such as licenses and the planets you have dominated.

Version 0.10.0
  * Breaking changes:
    * The accompany objective on mission npcs no longer implicitly sets the save objective. Plugin missions that had "accompany" but not "save" should be changed to include "save" if the intention of the mission is that the npcs live (without the bug this time). (@Amazinite, @RisingLeaf)
  * Big changes:
    * Added a young alien faction located beyond the core, inhabiting a region of space that is home to long-lost secrets and mysterious lifeforms. (@Saugia, @GefullteTaubenbrust2)

    * A long-standing UI feature has been finished: the job board can now be sorted by various metrics! Jobs can be sorted alphabetically, pay, deadline, and more. (@alextd, @samrocketman)
    * A long-standing (and annoying) bug has also been fixed: out of system mission cargo and passengers will no longer be teleported to the player's location when loading a save. (Yes, this bug was reported enough over the years that this constitutes a big change.) (@warp-core)
    * Created a large number of new conditions for content creators to make use of, including the ability to set "global conditions" that can be accessed by any save file, as well as a few new places to use them, including allowing individual lines and choices in a conversation to be hidden by conditions. More specifics can be found below.

    * Many graphical improvements, such as adding parallax for planets, stars, and haze and remodelling and improving various assets. See the graphics section for more details.
    * Made various sweeping balance changes to multiple ships and outfits to improve lesser used items or strategies and turn certain choices into a question of what fits best for the role you're looking for instead of there being single no-brainer choices as to which ship or outfit is the best. See the balance section of the changelog for more details.
    * Added over 20 new missions to the Remnant storyline, following the Remnant as they further investigate the Ember Waste and deal with the troubles it throws at them.

(@ravenshining, @Dragenhart, @EjoThims, @GefullteTaubenbrust2, @MasterOfGrey, @Saugia, @warp-core)
    * Redid large parts of the Free Worlds campaign intro and start chapters. The goals of this rework were to enhance various themes and features of the plot that were on the weaker side while also laying the groundwork for future content, such as the other main human campaigns and post-main campaign content. This rework is the first of many, with this stage primarily focusing on Tomek's storyline and the Syndicate's role in the main campaign. (@Amazinite)

      * 25 spare landscape images. (@petervdmeer)
      * The player can now attempt to ask the Unfettered for help with communicating with the Wanderers. (@Anarchist2)
      * A new set of missions involving the various Arach houses. (@Arachi-Lover)
      * New jobs and missions in the Deep region to encourage players to stick around and discover more major storylines there. (@MasterOfGrey)
      * Added a new, elusive space creature to the Ember Waste. (@Galaucus)
      * A new mission chain to investigate the appearance of a mysterious system within the Graveyard. (@beccabunny)
      * A new mission where you speak with a news reporter after the bombings of Geminus and Martini. (@DJF113)
      * A new mission chain centering on research done by the Kimek. (@Arachi-Lover)

      * Added tiny, small, and medium-sized reverse thrusters for the Hai. (@Hecter94)
    * Mission changes:
      * Killing both Arfecta that defend the Wanderer planets now causes hostility with the Wanderers upon landing on any of their planets, not just one specific planet. (@Terin)
      * The Deep Archaeology and Unfettered first contact missions now contain branches if the player knows about the Pug or Sheragi respectively, before reaching those missions. (@BlazingDiesel)
      * The Remnant now gifts a Puffin to the player instead of requiring that the player buy one. (@Zitchas)
      * The Hai first contact mission now describes the wormhole connection to human space in case the player reached the Hai via jump drive. (@Anarchist2)
      * Reordered the Deep: Remnant missions so that further investigation into the Ember Waste doesn't happen until after Deep: Scientist Rescue. (@Amazinite)
      * Removed a stopover location that was optional in a Remnant mission. (@Zitchas)
      * Reworked most pirate jobs to be higher risk but also higher reward. (@Pointedstick)
      * The "Hiding in plain sight" mission now has a deadline. (@Pointedstick, @waterhouse)
      * Changed some missions to take advantage of the new conversation action behavior. (@Amazinite)
      * Greatly reduced the threshold on the raid warning mission for players with high pirate attraction fleets from about 50% to about 14%. (@Amazinite)
      * Ivan in Terminus exploration now gives the player a hint on where to go to continue the storyline in the Deep. (@Amazinite)
      * Refit the Cosmic Devil to use less Remnant tech. (@Amazinite)
      * Added additional dialog to "FW Katya 7". (@saraswativ23)
      * Removed a mention of Freya from "FW Alphas 1.1," as she is located somewhere else at that time in the story. (@DownsB)
      * The Paradise Fortune missions now restore your reputation with the Republic to exactly what it was before the missions should you choose to cooperate with the Navy. (@Anarchist2)
      * Change the government of some hostile mission NPCs to dummy governments to prevent permanent reputation loss with the main government. (@PeacefulPotato)
      * Hai jobs now grant a small amount of reputation upon completion, allowing access to Hai-home without the need to fight the Unfettered. (@Terin)
      * Moved the defer option in "There Might Be Riots 1" to an earlier point so that information isn't repeated if the player defers multiple times. (@Anarchist2)
      * Unwanted Cargo can now trigger anywhere outside Hai space instead of only in human space. (@Anarchist2)
      * Various minor spaceport missions that did not mention their payments now do. (@Anarchist2)
      * The Hauler VI mission no longer offers if you don't have any weapons. (@Anarchist2)
      * The intro mission now mentions the usefulness of buying local maps. (@Hecter94)
      * Improved the salaries you get during the Free Worlds campaign to better cover the ships you're expected to have at the time. (@Anarchist2)
      * The final Kestrel mission now displays the thumbnail of the Kestrel you chose. (@Anarchist2)
      * Increased how much the Coalition pays for Yottrite from 220k per sample to 350k per sample. (@Arachi-Lover)
      * Updated the prisoner transports in some Free Worlds missions to be equipped with brigs. (@AlbertNewton)
      * The Remnant missions that ask you to get a copy of Alexandria's archives now make it clear that you keep a copy for yourself. (@Amazinite)

      * Improved the dialog in one of the new Remnant missions to make it more understandable. (@alextd)
      * Rewrote part of "FW Hope Recon 1C" to have the Gunboat join the Oathkeepers should you ask them to surrender. (@jostephd)
      * The senator in "FW Senate 1B" now commends you if you reach the destination in an impossibly short time. (@Hecter94)
      * The corporate espionage job now has a short deadline, as it is easy to miss the objective and never find the NPC that you're supposed to scan. (@Terin)
      * Slight wording change in FW Bounty 1 to reduce repeated information. (@Anarchist2)
    * Balance:
      * Altered the default equation for when a ship becomes disabled to become continuous. The lowest-hull ships still become disabled at about 45% remaining hull, but the highest-hull ships approach a threshold of 10% hull remaining instead of all ships over 4,500 hull becoming disabled at 15%. This results in most human ships becoming disabled slightly earlier while higher health alien ships become disabled slightly later. (@Ferociousfiend)
      * Buffed the Heavy Shuttle while increasing its price to make it more of a midpoint between the Shuttle and the Scout or Bounder rather than having a massive price gap between the Shuttle and Heavy Shuttle and the ships mentioned previously. (@Zitchas)
        * +2 bunks
        * -20 mass
        * -0.2 drag
        * +5 cargo space
        * +10 outfit space
        * +6 weapon space
        * +5 engine space
        * +15,000 cost
      * Buffed the cargo and bunk capacities of civilian Coalition ships to make them more appealing compared to when you're likely to reach them. (@Arachi-Lover)
        * +10% cargo and bunks on Saryd light freighters
        * +20% cargo and bunks on Saryd heavy freighters
        * +50% bunks and +10% cargo space on all Kimek ships
        * +20% cargo space on Arach light freighters
        * +40% cargo space on Arach heavy freighters
      * Gave the Sparrow an extra bunk to slightly increase its effectiveness in capturing other interceptors during the early game. (@Terin)
      * Greatly reduced the required crew and bunks on the Rainmaker so that it's no longer tied with the Gunboat as the highest required crew among human light warships, instead having one of the lowest crew requirements. (@Terin)
        * 7 -> 3 required crew
        * 14 -> 7 bunks
      * Lowered the offer requirements on more lucrative jobs in human space, allowing the player to start running them sooner. (@Terin)
      * Increased the Lampyrid's number of bunks to match the source material. (@Zitchas)
      * Archons now ramp up significantly in strength when they feel threatened. (@Zitchas)
        * 11x normal DPS when threatened
      * Buffed the Protector. (@Amazinite)
        * The Protector has long been considered the worst human heavy warship in the game. While some heavy warships should be better than others, the Protector had almost no redeeming factors. These changes seek to make the Protector more of a heavy weapons platform, slow but able to pack a considerable punch when within range.
        * 6 -> 8 turrets, going from "a lot" to "tied with the most among all heavy warships in the game."
        * +500 shields
        * +1300 hull
        * +20 outfit space
        * +10 weapon space
      * Rebalanced various human primary weapons. Here are some highlights: (@Amazinite)
        * Lasers have been the overwhelmingly most popular choice among human primary weapons for years due to their high damage but low firing costs, with blasters seeing little use due to their high energy and heat costs but lower damage. These changes seek to bring all human weapons more in line with one another, making choosing a weapon more a matter of what role you need filled than a matter of which weapon is better than all the rest.
        * Lasers:
          * Lasers are a pirate's friend and always will be. Easy to use and great for disabling ships without destroying them, but not necessarily the best at everything.
          * +33% firing energy and heat
        * Blasters:
          * Blasters are the smallest weapons in human space. They are weak but cheap and strong in numbers. Put eight quad blaster turrets on a new Protector and have some fun.
          * -40% firing energy and heat
          * +10% shield and hull damage
        * Cannons:
          * Cannons are the big guns. Powerful, even in small numbers. The weapons you pull out when you want to punch a hole in something.
          * +20% shield and hull damage on the Particle Cannon and Proton Gun. The Plasma Cannon has been untouched, as its added heat damage is still rather powerful.
      * Added an additional Small Heat Shunt to the stock Korath Raider. (@Arachi-Lover)
      * Rebalanced most engines in the game. Here are some highlights: (@Amazinite)
        * The goal of this was to improve lesser used engines while also making it so that choosing which engines you use is more a matter of what you're looking for instead of there being one best choice for everything.
        * Afterburners were made 33% smaller while providing 50% more thrust at 75-80% less fuel, as afterburners have long been considered not worth installing.
        * The largest ion and plasma engines were made smaller and easier to install, as these engines were so large that it was seldom feasible to use them.
        * Ion and plasma engines now provide about 20% more thrust and turn, so atomic engines aren't such a no-brainer upgrade.
        * Buffed the reverse thrust on Remnant thrusters while reducing their forward thrust to compensate, making Remnant engines more the choice for people who enjoy the reverse thrust instead of being incredibly good for almost everything.
      * Differentiated the Bulk Freighter and Container Transport. (@ravenshining)
      * Changed Coalition solar panels to use solar heat instead of heat generation. (@Arachi-Lover)
      * Buffed ion damage. Ionization now causes a ship's weapons to jam in addition to draining the ship's energy, causing ionization to be a damage debuff. The lower a ship's energy capacity and the higher its ionization, the more likely a weapon is to jam when attempting to fire, capping out at 50%. Jammed weapons must reload before attempting to fire again. (@Amazinite)
      * Rebalanced most battery outfits in the game. Here are some highlights: (@warp-core, @Zitchas)
        * The goal of this was to make relying on your batteries more viable, as with weaker batteries from past versions, outfitting your ship has almost always been a matter of ensuring your reactor produces enough energy for all your systems. With stronger batteries, getting the best energy reactor possible should be less of a requirement as you can now rely on your energy capacity to get you through short bursts of intense combat. Even going so far as to use nothing but batteries with little to no energy generation should also be a possibility as a cheaper but not as a combat-capable alternative.
        * Greatly buffed the energy capacity of most battery outfits.
          * Most dedicated battery outfits have received a 4x buff.
          * Some outfits that are batteries as a secondary characteristic, such as Korath System Cores or Wanderer Sun reactors, received a 2x buff.
          * Wanderer Small and Large Biochemical Cells received a 25x and 42.8x buff, respectively.
        * Greatly reduced the size of the two largest human and Hai batteries to make them more feasible to use.
        * Cut the cost of dedicated battery outfits in half.
      * Added an arrival distance to all systems in the game. The arrival distance is equal to the system's habitable distance, capped at the range of [500, 5000]. This causes ships to generally enter the system farther apart from one another and farther from any inhabited planets in the system, improving the ability of a player to pick and choose their fights. (@Zitchas)
      * Traded some batteries for better engines, weapons, or repairs on Heliarch ships. (@Arachi-Lover)
      * Slightly adjusted the stats on Scout and Bounder to better fit their size and role. (@Anarchist2)
        * -100 fuel capacity on the Bounder.
        * +800 shields on the Scout.
        * -1 required crew on the Scout.
    * Graphics:
      * Completely redid and improved the graphics for all existing stars. (Matteo "Lead" M., @ravenshining)
      * Created various new star graphics, including giant and supergiant variants for all star spectral types. (Matteo "Lead" M., @ravenshining)
      * Created a new planet sprite for Saturn. (@ravenshining)
      * Remodeled all Navy ships. (@GefullteTaubenbrust2)

      * Remodeled the Aerie, Bactrian, Mule, and Osprey. (@Saugia)
      * Remodeled the jump drive. (@Scrinarii1337)
      * Added extra detail to differentiate the Kestrel variants. (@Saugia)
      * Added extra detail to the Grab-Strike outfit image and updated its hardpoint sprite. (@ravenshining)
      * Remodeled the Quicksilver and Scout. (@Anarchist)
      * Remodeled the Enforcer Confrontation Gear outfit. (@1010todd)
      * Modeled the Tear of Skade for new missions in the Deep. (@Anarchist2)
      * Added unique graphics for Wanderer engine flares, corrosion and burn damage-over-time sparks, and Pug Zapper impacts. (@GefullteTaubenbrust2)
      * Redid plasma, Coalition, Pug, and Korath engine flares. (@GefullteTaubenbrust2)
      * Redid Pug ship, Coalition Finisher, and Hai Tracker explosion effects. (@GefullteTaubenbrust2)
      * Created models for the upcoming Sunder, Mining Drone, Hailstone, Heavy Gust, and Squall. (@Saugia)
      * Created a whole new scene for the plasma repeater. (@1010todd)
      * Doubled the resolution of all station graphics. (@Anarchist2)
      * Remodeled Quarg ringworlds. (@GefullteTaubenbrust2)
      * Remodeled the Pug ships. (@beccabunny)
    * Other:
      * The Pug worlds at the end of the main campaign now appear uninhabited after the Pug flee before becoming inhabited by humanity. (@Anarchist2)
      * Reworded a technically incorrect news entry. (@Anarchist2)
      * Tweaked the atomic engine sounds to be less harsh on the ear. (@ravenshining)
      * The Emerald Sword and Black Diamond now have set swizzles that don't change with the player's swizzle. (@kestrel1110)
      * Human ship name generation is now weighted so that Three Skeleton Key does not appear on every other pirate ship. (@Amazinite, @Pointedstick)
      * The Star Queen now comes with reverse engines by default and has been given reverse engine flares. (@Zitchas)
      * Tweaked the outfit cargo held by Remnant and Korath fleets in the Ember Waste to make more sense. (@Zitchas)
      * Added ships to Remnant fleets that were missing. (@Zitchas)
      * Poisonwood's spaceport description changes depending on the outcome of certain FW missions. (@Anarchist2)
      * Updated smaller human ships to use the new small secondary weapons. (@Zitchas)
      * Tweaked the descriptions on over 100 planets for better readability. (@skilaa)
      * Added reverse and steering flares to the Lampyrid. (@Zitchas)
      * The Remnant now become hostile when scanned and the player loses reputation on a completed scan or when a drone is destroyed. This behavior stops after the Remnant trust the player enough. (@Zitchas)
      * Standardized the habitable range of all systems given the star of each system. Some systems have had their planets moved around to compensate for this. (@Amazinite)
      * Readded the disables personality to Remnant fleets. (@Zitchas)
      * The Mereti will no longer remain neutral if the player attacks them after they've been made friendly. (@Hurleveur)
      * Added ramscoops to the outfitters of some Far North worlds. (@williaji)
      * The War Begins conversation no longer refers to ship licensing as being one of the Free Worlds' grievances against the Republic. (@Anarchist2)
      * The on visit dialog for "FW Albatross 2A" now mentions both possible missing objectives. (@Anarchist2)
      * The Strong Wind is now locked by a non-military Wanderer license instead of a military license. (@williaji)
      * Various human freighters and transports now come stock with reverse thrusters. (@Hecter94)
      * All fighter and drone descriptions now make it clear that you need a fighter or drone bay to carry them. (@Amazinite)
      * Reduced the mass of quantum keystones to better match their description instead of being a one-ton stone that people carry around. (@dragonmaus)
      * The first Wanderer colony in Korath space now comes with an outfitter so that you don't need to travel back to Wanderer space to rearm. (@williaji)
      * Black holes now add fuel to ships within their accretion disk, allowing ships that might have entered the system without any remaining fuel to risk getting torn to shreds to escape instead of being stuck forever. (@Amazinite)
      * Spaceport news on Wanderer planets no longer refers to them as Wanderers before you learn their name. (@Anarchist2)
      * Coalition worlds now have varying security levels instead of all having the default. (@Arachi-Lover)
      * Reworded the description of the Pug Biodefense outfit to not suggest that the Pug don't get affected by it because they do. (@Hecter94)
      * Changed the Korati Efreti station to always be located between the planet and the sun in the system, as the description suggests. (@warp-core)
      * Added two new ship categories. Space Liner, for very large transport ships, and Utility, for ships that didn't fit their previous category because they were a hybrid of multiple categories. (@MasterOfGrey)
      * Changed the stars for some systems in human space to match what is known about the real star system of the same name. (@ravenshining)
      * Created new "Mineral," "License," and "Unique" outfit categories, the former two breaking out of the "Special" category and the latter for one-time outfits gifted to the player. (@Anarchist2, @DarcyManoel, @Zitchas)
  * Game mechanics:
    * New mechanics:
      * Expanded the total number of swizzles from 7 to 27. (@Amazinite)
      * Missions are now capable of fining the player. (@petervdmeer)
      * Weapons can now create "target effects" that appear on ships similar to how jump drive effects appear. (@petervdmeer)
      * Weapon hardpoints can now be drawn under the ship. Turret hardpoints default to being drawn over the ship, while gun hardpoints default to being drawn under the ship. (@Amazinite)
      * All secondary weapons will be selected at once after cycling through your flagship's entire list of secondary weapons. Pressing the select secondary weapon key after selecting all weapons will cause no weapons to be selected. (@petervdmeer)
      * Outfit and ship categories can now be customized in the data files, allowing for the creation of new outfit or ship categories, including new categories of carried ships. (@Amazinite, @Hadron1776)
      * Choices of phrases can now have weighted outcomes akin to the weighting of variants in fleets. (@Amazinite)
      * Submunitions can now be created with an "offset" position and a "facing" angle relative to the parent projectile. (@petervdmeer, @tehhowch)
      * Created four new damage-over-time types that affect shields, hull, fuel, and heat. (@Amazinite)
      * Randomly spawned fleets are now able to use the derelict personality. (@Terin)
      * Hazards can now originate from objects in a system instead of just the system center. (@quyykk)
      * Sprites can now be drawn at customizable scales. (@Amazinite)
      * Conversations can now grant payments, levy fines, trigger events, write log entries, gift outfits, ships, and more through conversation action nodes. (@Amazinite, @tehhowch)
      * Custom text substitutions can now be created globally or within the scope of a single mission. (@Amazinite)
      * Governments can now have their reputation impacted by scanning their ships. (@Hurleveur)
      * Ships can be given a "crew equivalent" attribute that counts toward the reputation hit for interacting with a ship but doesn't contribute to boarding. (@Hurleveur)
      * Governments can now be provoked by starting a scan on their ships. (@quyykk)
      * Missions can now grant and require maps, discovering systems for the player, and requiring that nearby systems be discovered. (@LukeMarlin)
      * Added new attributes "operating income" and "income" that grant credits to the player each day. (@petervdmeer)
      * Raised the limit of the number of weapons allowed on a single ship from 32 to effectively unlimited. (@quyykk)
      * Governments can now incur a reputation loss from provoking their ships. (@Terin)
      * Engines can now have all the same costs for firing as weapons can (e.g., fuel, ionization, etc.). (@Ferociousfiend)
      * Weapons can now deal different hull damage to disabled ships compared to non-disabled ones. (@Amazinite, @ChamEV, @petervdmeer)
      * Outfits and ships can now be given a "heat capacity" attribute, which acts like mass in increasing a ship's heat capacity without reducing its acceleration and turn rate. (@Ferociousfiend)
      * Ships can now be given an overheat damage attribute that makes them take damage while overheated. (@10010101001)
      * Plugins can now optionally disable individual vanilla missions, events, and Person ship spawns. (@tehhowch)
      * Weapons can now be given "minable damage" which is used to damage minable asteroids instead of hull damage. (@pilover100)
      * Minables can now be given a random hull value that adds to their base hull. (@quyykk)
      * Added a new autocondition that allows missions to check what your flagship model is. (@warp-core)
      * Effects can now be defined with absolute angle and velocity values instead of inheriting the parent's attribute. (@Hurleveur)
      * System hazards can now be defined as being "system-wide", causing them to damage all ships in the system regardless of distance and center environmental effect generation on the center of the screen instead of the origin of the hazard. (@Hurleveur, @Amazinite)
      * Add/remove syntax can now be used on various attributes of a Government during an Event. (@Hurleveur)
      * Missions can now be given an "on daily" action to cause this to occur every time the date advances (when jumping and when departing a planet). (@thvk-net)
      * Carried ships will now restock their ammo by taking from the carrier's installed ammunition. (@tehhowch)
      * Events can now remove specific objects from a system instead of only being able to remove all objects. (@warp-core)
    * Mechanic changes:
      * "hit effect" behavior for hazards has been replaced with "target effect". (@petervdmeer)
      * Committing an atrocity now only affects the reputation of governments friendly to the government that the atrocity was committed against. (@Amazinite)
      * Flotsams dumped by a certain government will no longer be picked up by ships of the same government. This prevents merchants from picking up cargo dumped by other merchants that was intended to distract pirates. The player's government is exempt from this change. (@petervdmeer)
      * The data syntax for requiring a license on a ship or outfit now accepts one-line specifications. (@tehhowch)
      * Some heat is now removed when firing ammunition with mass. (@tehhowch)
      * Updated collision mask generation to allow ships to contain holes or disjointed regions. (@flaviojs, @tehhowch)
      * Bribing a government now breaks all projectile collisions between you and the government you bribed, preventing accidentally becoming hostile again after bribing. (@Amazinite, @tehhowch)
      * Systems can now define multiple asteroid belts. Asteroid belts can be given weights that determine the likelihood of asteroids appearing in that belt. (@Amazinite)
      * Whether an outfit is determined to have been mined from an asteroid is now handled by a positive "minable" attribute instead of being assumed from a negative "installable" attribute. (@Terin)
      * Jobs that have been offered but not yet accepted can no longer be accepted if all of the job's requirements are no longer met (e.g., have the proper outfit(s) installed, have enough credits for any negative payment) instead of only checking for cargo and passenger space. (@quyykk)
      * Submunitions now more properly inherit the velocity of the parent projectile, and inaccuracy is more accurately applied. (@Amazinite, @DeBlister, @oo13)
      * Weapons with an ammo usage of 0 no longer auto refill that ammunition. (@Amazinite)
      * Improved the behavior of the coward and appeasing ship personalities to more consistently trigger and have an effect. (@Hurleveur)
      * Active missions that you no longer have space for now count as aborted instead of simply failed. (@Amazinite)
