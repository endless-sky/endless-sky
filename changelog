        * Text changes to all chains.
        * Care Package to South:
          * Limited the source to "near earth" planets, increased offer rate to 65%.
          * Reworked the way the follow-up missions are handled:
            * Care Package 2a has been replaced with a new mission, FW Deep Memorial, a set of missions and events that offers regardless of the player's choices, but which has a branch if Brower dies during the attack.
            * Care Package 2b has been moved from immediately after Diplomacy 4 to during the first FW break, and now offers on Rust instead of Deep. The flamethrower mission will likely bring players to Rust anyway, but it's no longer in the way of the main campaign.
        * Moving House:
          * Increased offer rate to 35%, limited source planets to "near earth", "core" and "paradise".
          * Tied the second part of the chain to the FW chapter break instead of Thule's independence.
          * The player can now choose to decline the follow-up mission.
        * Southern Fiance:
          * Reduced the possible source planets to urban core Syndicate worlds.
          * Cut all of the follow up missions except for the marriage letter. The only mission string that gets multiple epilogue missions is the Free Worlds campaign; having this many follow-ups to a single mission is intrusive at best.
          * Moved some of the information from the later missions up into the first mission to compensate.
      * "Deep: Interrogation" no longer offers during the main campaign. (@Saugia)
      * Various improvements to some pirate jobs. (@ziproot)
        * "Drug Running" missions are now "infiltrating".
        * Added (and used) generic aborted phrases for pirate slave jobs.
        * Failing or aborting a pirate slave job causes a reduction in reputation with the "Pirate" government.
        * Many jobs now have a minimum travel distance of 4, instead of 3, to prevent them from involving travelling between the Men system and a CCOR world, as this route does not involve any territory hostile to pirates. Affected jobs:
          * "Cargo Smuggling", "Bulk", and "Stealth (South)" variations,
          * "Drug Running", and "Stealth (South)" variation,

          * "Escort Illegal Cargo" South variation, and
          * "Escort Stolen Vessel" South variation.
        * The targets NPCs in "Eliminating Law Enforcement" jobs have been given the "marked" personality.
        * Alphabetized the list of personalities for the target NPCs in "Eliminating Competition" jobs.
        * Various jobs will now only place NPCs in systems neighbored by a non-Pirate system. Affected jobs are:
          * "Eliminating Law Enforcement" Core and South variations,
          * "Raid on Merchants" North and South variations, and
          * "Cargo Theft (South)".
        * Various jobs will now only offer from systems neighbored by a non-Pirate system (that is, they will no longer offer from CCOR worlds). Affected jobs are:
          * "Eliminating Law Enforcement (South)",
          * "Southern Pirate Defense",
          * "Cargo Theft (South)", and
          * "FW Assassination".
      * Use "mark" instead of "waypoint" in Betelgeuse in "Deep Scientist Rescue 0". (@roadrunner56)
      * Use "mark" instead of "waypoint" in "Pact Recon 3". (@ziproot)
    * Balance:
      * Reduced the chances of finding Bactrians in random pirate fleet spawns by half. (@alexrovw)
      * Nerfed the Unfettered medical jobs. (@Hurleveur)

        * Sidewinder pod 4 -> 6
        * Typhoon pod 2 -> 3
      * Reduced the damage and increased the blast radius of the Heavy Rocket (and Pod). (@Quantumshark)
        * "blast radius": 50 -> 90
        * "shield damage": 1060 -> 790
        * "hull damage": 900 -> 670

      * "Expedition to Hope 2" now gives clearance to the destination, allowing it to offer if you are hostile with the destination instead of not offering without explanation. (@warp-core)
      * Old pilots who completed part of the Wanderer campaign will now be properly retroactively granted the Wanderer outfit license. (@warp-core)
      * The "Remnant: Expanded Horizons Astral" job can no longer choose the Deep Space systems as waypoints. (@Quantumshark)

      * Replaced the "shield resistance" attribute (which doesn't do anything) on the Embersylph with "ion resistance". (@Quantumshark)
      * Set the Hai merchant fleets to use the correct government. (@warp-core)

      * Trailing whitespace in hails no longer causes hails to overlap with one another. (@flowers9)

      * Added the mission destination to the description of "Remnant: Cognizance 7". (@lumbar527)
      * The Heliarch jump drive jobs now use the <payment> text replacement instead of spelling out the payment. (@Arachi-Lover, @tibetiroka)
      * Removed a sentence that didn't make sense from the description of the secure package delivery job completion dialog. (@ziproot)
    * Balance:
      * Added weaponry to some human fighters to fit in the additional hardpoints that they were recently given. (@AvianGeneticist)
      * Increased the reputation gains with Unfettered sympathizers when doing Unfettered jobs. (@Hurleveur)
      * Changed the stock Frigate to have two Torpedo Launchers instead of one Torpedo and a Sidewinder, in exchange for less battery power. (@warp-core)
      * Added a deadline to the pirate occupation spaceport missions to prevent them from being stacked indefinitely. (@lumbar527)
      * The Quarg in Korath space now receive permanent reputation hits if you attack the Efreti. (@Saugia)
      * Gave the Dagger +5 engine space and stock A120 Atomic Thrusters to give it more of a niche among the other human fighters. (@Quantumshark)
      * Gave the Violin Spider +4 weapon space to allow it to equip an anti-missile turret in addition to its gun. (@Hurleveur)
      * Flattened the thrust scaling of sets of engines as you get bigger engines in a set. (@Quantumshark)
        * The exact changes depend on the set of engines, but the changes are roughly as follows:
          * Tiny: +23.0% thrust
          * Small: +14.3%
          * Medium: +5.5%
          * Large: +0.0%
          * Huge: -5.1%
        * In other words: small engines have been made stronger while large engines have been made slightly weaker. The result of this is that smaller ships should be generally quicker than they were before while larger ships should either see no change or should be slightly slower.
        * Afterburners are unchanged.
      * Reduced the cost of the supercapacitor from 9,000 credits to 1,500, to bring it closer in line with other human batteries while still having a slight "premium" for its tiny size. (@Zitchas)
      * Removed a few ship variants from the pirate raid fleet that had high damage weapons not conducive to disabling their target. (@Zitchas)
      * The Ka'het Nullifier has been rebalanced to more effectively disable targets by draining their energy. (@beccabunny)
        * Energy damage from 0 to 3200. This is energy which is immediately removed from the target's batteries on impact.
        * Ion damage from 150 to 220. This is lingering energy loss that results in about 22,000 energy lost over the course of the next ten seconds after impact.
        * Scrambling damage from 150 to 10. This causes the Nullifier to have much less of an effect on the target's weapons, instead relying on its much greater energy and ion damage.
      * Buffed the Ion Cannon's ion and scrambling damage by 20%, from 5 to 6 for each in order to make it a bit more competitive with other weaponry. (@Hurleveur)
      * Reduced the profitability of commodity trading in Hai space by about 40% by bringing trade prices closer together, as the lack of piracy in Hai space makes it an easy place for trading. (@Anarchist2)
      * Combined the two Barb variants into a single ship. This effectively just means that the turreted variant of the ship has gained +4 weapon space, and the Proton Gun variant of the ship is no longer sold. These two ships weren't sufficiently differentiated from one another to justify keeping both around. (@Quantumshark)
      * Reduced the buff to engine space provided to the Marauder Leviathan and Falcon engine variants. (@Quantumshark)
        * Falcon: +55 to +25 (total of 220 to 190)
        * Leviathan: +80 to +40 (total of 220 to 180)
    * Other:
      * Tweaked the wording of the description of the Vivid Aether planet. (@Zitchas)
      * Ringworld planets now have a "ringworld" attribute for missions to use. (@Quantumshark)
      * Added a "frozen" attribute to various cold and frozen worlds for missions and spaceport news to use. (@dorbarker, @Anarchist2)
      * The Unfettered Solifuge and Violin Spider are now added to the Unfettered shipyards at the same time as they are added to Unfettered fleets. (@Hurleveur)
      * Added the "forest" attribute to Stormhold and changed its planet sprite in order to better match the planet's description. (@bene-dictator)
      * Various NPC ships in Free Worlds missions which state that they carry cargo now actually have the cargo you're told they have. (@bene-dictator)
      * Changed the attitude of various Hai governments toward certain actions that the player takes to better reflect the story. (@Hurleveur)
        * You no longer gain reputation with the Hai for attacking or destroying Unfettered ships.

        * The scan time is now always 2 seconds at the best and 10 seconds at the worst.

    * Added a preference to blink the map mission marker for missions with a deadline more quickly if you have fewer extra days to reach the destination compared to the minimum number of days necessary to reach it. The default behavior is to simply blink based on the number of days until the deadline. (@TomGoodIdea)

    * Only scan messages that are considered important will now be displayed. Important scan messages are when you are being scanned, or an escort with illegal cargo is being scanned. (@TomGoodIdea)

    * Added a young alien faction located beyond the core, inhabiting a region of space that is home to long-lost secrets and mysterious lifeforms. (@Saugia, @GefullteTaubenbrust2)

    * A long-standing UI feature has been finished: the job board can now be sorted by various metrics! Jobs can be sorted alphabetically, pay, deadline, and more. (@alextd, @samrocketman)
    * A long-standing (and annoying) bug has also been fixed: out of system mission cargo and passengers will no longer be teleported to the player's location when loading a save. (Yes, this bug was reported enough over the years that this constitutes a big change.) (@warp-core)

More specifics can be found below.

Version 0.9.15:
  * Big changes:
    * Over a year's worth of new content and bug fixes! We hope it was worth the wait!
    * Many graphical improvements, such as adding parallax for planets, stars, and haze and remodelling and improving various assets. See the graphics section for more details.
    * Made various sweeping balance changes to multiple ships and outfits to improve lesser used items or strategies and turn certain choices into a question of what fits best for the role you're looking for instead of there being single no-brainer choices as to which ship or outfit is the best. See the balance section of the changelog for more details.
    * Added over 20 new missions to the Remnant storyline, following the Remnant as they further investigate the Ember Waste and deal with the troubles it throws at them. Includes the addition of new ships and outfits. (@Zitchas, @Azure3141, @beccabunny, @Dschiltt, @GefullteTaubenbrust2, jeverett#3344, @Saugia, scrinarii1337)
    * Added a massive amount of new content to the Korath Exiles, including two new systems near the core, multiple new ships, over two dozen new weapons and outfits, improved models for some older ships and outfits, and a new set of names for the outfits and ships that avoid having "Korath" as a prefix for every name. (@ravenshining, @Dragenhart, @EjoThims, @GefullteTaubenbrust2, @MasterOfGrey, @Saugia, @warp-core)
    * Redid large parts of the Free Worlds campaign intro and start chapters. The goals of this rework were to enhance various themes and features of the plot that were on the weaker side while also laying the groundwork for future content, such as the other main human campaigns and post-main campaign content. This rework is the first of many, with this stage primarily focusing on Tomek's storyline and the Syndicate's role in the main campaign. (@Amazinite)

        * +15,000 cost
      * Buffed the cargo and bunk capacities of civilian Coalition ships to make them more appealing compared to when you're likely to reach them. (@Arachi-Lover)
        * +10% cargo and bunks on Saryd light freighters
        * +20% cargo and bunks on Saryd heavy freighters
        * +50% bunks and +10% cargo space on all Kimek ships
        * +20% cargo space on Arach light freighters
        * +40% cargo space on Arach heavy freighters
      * Gave the Sparrow an extra bunk to slightly increase its effectiveness in capturing other interceptors during the early game. (@Terin)
      * Greatly reduced the required crew and bunks on the Rainmaker so that it's no longer tied with the Gunboat as the highest required crew among human light warships, instead having one of the lowest crew requirements. (@Terin)
        * 7 -> 3 required crew
        * 14 -> 7 bunks
      * Lowered the offer requirements on more lucrative jobs in human space, allowing the player to start running them sooner. (@Terin)
      * Increased the Lampyrid's number of bunks to match the source material. (@Zitchas)
      * Archons now ramp up significantly in strength when they feel threatened. (@Zitchas)
        * 11x normal DPS when threatened
      * Buffed the Protector. (@Amazinite)
        * The Protector has long been considered the worst human heavy warship in the game. While some heavy warships should be better than others, the Protector had almost no redeeming factors. These changes seek to make the Protector more of a heavy weapons platform, slow but able to pack a considerable punch when within range.
        * 6 -> 8 turrets, going from "a lot" to "tied with the most among all heavy warships in the game."
        * +500 shields
        * +1300 hull
        * +20 outfit space
        * +10 weapon space
      * Rebalanced various human primary weapons. Here are some highlights: (@Amazinite)
        * Lasers have been the overwhelmingly most popular choice among human primary weapons for years due to their high damage but low firing costs, with blasters seeing little use due to their high energy and heat costs but lower damage. These changes seek to bring all human weapons more in line with one another, making choosing a weapon more a matter of what role you need filled than a matter of which weapon is better than all the rest.
        * Lasers:
          * Lasers are a pirate's friend and always will be. Easy to use and great for disabling ships without destroying them, but not necessarily the best at everything.
          * +33% firing energy and heat
        * Blasters:
          * Blasters are the smallest weapons in human space. They are weak but cheap and strong in numbers. Put eight quad blaster turrets on a new Protector and have some fun.
          * -40% firing energy and heat
          * +10% shield and hull damage
        * Cannons:
          * Cannons are the big guns. Powerful, even in small numbers. The weapons you pull out when you want to punch a hole in something.
          * +20% shield and hull damage on the Particle Cannon and Proton Gun. The Plasma Cannon has been untouched, as its added heat damage is still rather powerful.
      * Added an additional Small Heat Shunt to the stock Korath Raider. (@Arachi-Lover)
      * Rebalanced most engines in the game. Here are some highlights: (@Amazinite)
        * The goal of this was to improve lesser used engines while also making it so that choosing which engines you use is more a matter of what you're looking for instead of there being one best choice for everything.
        * Afterburners were made 33% smaller while providing 50% more thrust at 75-80% less fuel, as afterburners have long been considered not worth installing.
        * The largest ion and plasma engines were made smaller and easier to install, as these engines were so large that it was seldom feasible to use them.
        * Ion and plasma engines now provide about 20% more thrust and turn, so atomic engines aren't such a no-brainer upgrade.
        * Buffed the reverse thrust on Remnant thrusters while reducing their forward thrust to compensate, making Remnant engines more the choice for people who enjoy the reverse thrust instead of being incredibly good for almost everything.
      * Differentiated the Bulk Freighter and Container Transport. (@ravenshining)
      * Changed Coalition solar panels to use solar heat instead of heat generation. (@Arachi-Lover)
      * Buffed ion damage. Ionization now causes a ship's weapons to jam in addition to draining the ship's energy, causing ionization to be a damage debuff. The lower a ship's energy capacity and the higher its ionization, the more likely a weapon is to jam when attempting to fire, capping out at 50%. Jammed weapons must reload before attempting to fire again. (@Amazinite)
      * Rebalanced most battery outfits in the game. Here are some highlights: (@warp-core, @Zitchas)
        * The goal of this was to make relying on your batteries more viable, as with weaker batteries from past versions, outfitting your ship has almost always been a matter of ensuring your reactor produces enough energy for all your systems. With stronger batteries, getting the best energy reactor possible should be less of a requirement as you can now rely on your energy capacity to get you through short bursts of intense combat. Even going so far as to use nothing but batteries with little to no energy generation should also be a possibility as a cheaper but not as a combat-capable alternative.
        * Greatly buffed the energy capacity of most battery outfits.
          * Most dedicated battery outfits have received a 4x buff.
          * Some outfits that are batteries as a secondary characteristic, such as Korath System Cores or Wanderer Sun reactors, received a 2x buff.
          * Wanderer Small and Large Biochemical Cells received a 25x and 42.8x buff, respectively.
        * Greatly reduced the size of the two largest human and Hai batteries to make them more feasible to use.
        * Cut the cost of dedicated battery outfits in half.
      * Added an arrival distance to all systems in the game. The arrival distance is equal to the system's habitable distance, capped at the range of [500, 5000]. This causes ships to generally enter the system farther apart from one another and farther from any inhabited planets in the system, improving the ability of a player to pick and choose their fights. (@Zitchas)
      * Traded some batteries for better engines, weapons, or repairs on Heliarch ships. (@Arachi-Lover)
      * Slightly adjusted the stats on Scout and Bounder to better fit their size and role. (@Anarchist2)
        * -100 fuel capacity on the Bounder.
        * +800 shields on the Scout.
        * -1 required crew on the Scout.
    * Graphics:
      * Completely redid and improved the graphics for all existing stars. (Matteo "Lead" M., @ravenshining)

      * Modeled the Tear of Skade for new missions in the Deep. (@Anarchist2)
      * Added unique graphics for Wanderer engine flares, corrosion and burn damage-over-time sparks, and Pug Zapper impacts. (@GefullteTaubenbrust2)
      * Redid plasma, Coalition, Pug, and Korath engine flares. (@GefullteTaubenbrust2)
      * Redid Pug ship, Coalition Finisher, and Hai Tracker explosion effects. (@GefullteTaubenbrust2)
      * Created models for the upcoming Sunder, Mining Drone, Hailstone, Heavy Gust, and Squall. (@Saugia)
      * Created a whole new scene for the plasma repeater. (@1010todd)
      * Doubled the resolution of all station graphics. (@Anarchist2)
      * Remodeled Quarg ringworlds. (@GefullteTaubenbrust2)
      * Remodeled the Pug ships. (@beccabunny)
    * Other:

      * Reworded a technically incorrect news entry. (@Anarchist2)
      * Tweaked the atomic engine sounds to be less harsh on the ear. (@ravenshining)
      * The Emerald Sword and Black Diamond now have set swizzles that don't change with the player's swizzle. (@kestrel1110)

      * Added reverse and steering flares to the Lampyrid. (@Zitchas)
      * The Remnant now become hostile when scanned and the player loses reputation on a completed scan or when a drone is destroyed. This behavior stops after the Remnant trust the player enough. (@Zitchas)
      * Standardized the habitable range of all systems given the star of each system. Some systems have had their planets moved around to compensate for this. (@Amazinite)
      * Readded the disables personality to Remnant fleets. (@Zitchas)
      * The Mereti will no longer remain neutral if the player attacks them after they've been made friendly. (@Hurleveur)
      * Added ramscoops to the outfitters of some Far North worlds. (@williaji)
      * The War Begins conversation no longer refers to ship licensing as being one of the Free Worlds' grievances against the Republic. (@Anarchist2)

      * The Strong Wind is now locked by a non-military Wanderer license instead of a military license. (@williaji)
      * Various human freighters and transports now come stock with reverse thrusters. (@Hecter94)
      * All fighter and drone descriptions now make it clear that you need a fighter or drone bay to carry them. (@Amazinite)
      * Reduced the mass of quantum keystones to better match their description instead of being a one-ton stone that people carry around. (@dragonmaus)
      * The first Wanderer colony in Korath space now comes with an outfitter so that you don't need to travel back to Wanderer space to rearm. (@williaji)
      * Black holes now add fuel to ships within their accretion disk, allowing ships that might have entered the system without any remaining fuel to risk getting torn to shreds to escape instead of being stuck forever. (@Amazinite)
      * Spaceport news on Wanderer planets no longer refers to them as Wanderers before you learn their name. (@Anarchist2)
      * Coalition worlds now have varying security levels instead of all having the default. (@Arachi-Lover)

      * Changed the Korati Efreti station to always be located between the planet and the sun in the system, as the description suggests. (@warp-core)
      * Added two new ship categories. Space Liner, for very large transport ships, and Utility, for ships that didn't fit their previous category because they were a hybrid of multiple categories. (@MasterOfGrey)
      * Changed the stars for some systems in human space to match what is known about the real star system of the same name. (@ravenshining)
      * Created new "Mineral," "License," and "Unique" outfit categories, the former two breaking out of the "Special" category and the latter for one-time outfits gifted to the player. (@Anarchist2, @DarcyManoel, @Zitchas)
  * Game mechanics:
    * New mechanics:

      * Missions can now grant and require maps, discovering systems for the player, and requiring that nearby systems be discovered. (@LukeMarlin)
      * Added new attributes "operating income" and "income" that grant credits to the player each day. (@petervdmeer)
      * Raised the limit of the number of weapons allowed on a single ship from 32 to effectively unlimited. (@quyykk)

      * Added a new autocondition that allows missions to check what your flagship model is. (@warp-core)
      * Effects can now be defined with absolute angle and velocity values instead of inheriting the parent's attribute. (@Hurleveur)
      * System hazards can now be defined as being "system-wide", causing them to damage all ships in the system regardless of distance and center environmental effect generation on the center of the screen instead of the origin of the hazard. (@Hurleveur, @Amazinite)
      * Add/remove syntax can now be used on various attributes of a Government during an Event. (@Hurleveur)
      * Missions can now be given an "on daily" action to cause this to occur every time the date advances (when jumping and when departing a planet). (@thvk-net)
      * Carried ships will now restock their ammo by taking from the carrier's installed ammunition. (@tehhowch)
      * Events can now remove specific objects from a system instead of only being able to remove all objects. (@warp-core)

      * "hit effect" behavior for hazards has been replaced with "target effect". (@petervdmeer)
      * Committing an atrocity now only affects the reputation of governments friendly to the government that the atrocity was committed against. (@Amazinite)
      * Flotsams dumped by a certain government will no longer be picked up by ships of the same government. This prevents merchants from picking up cargo dumped by other merchants that was intended to distract pirates. The player's government is exempt from this change. (@petervdmeer)

      * Jobs that have been offered but not yet accepted can no longer be accepted if all of the job's requirements are no longer met (e.g., have the proper outfit(s) installed, have enough credits for any negative payment) instead of only checking for cargo and passenger space. (@quyykk)
      * Submunitions now more properly inherit the velocity of the parent projectile, and inaccuracy is more accurately applied. (@Amazinite, @DeBlister, @oo13)
      * Weapons with an ammo usage of 0 no longer auto refill that ammunition. (@Amazinite)
      * Improved the behavior of the coward and appeasing ship personalities to more consistently trigger and have an effect. (@Hurleveur)
      * Active missions that you no longer have space for now count as aborted instead of simply failed. (@Amazinite)
      * Fighters and drones now retreat and redeploy at 50% and 75% health, respectively, instead of 25% and 35%, increasing their survivability. (@Amazinite)
      * Ships that are appeasing no longer drop their cargo if there are no hostile ships to drop it for. (@DeBlister)
      * The inaccuracy of a projectile is now also applied to the firing effect. (@DeBlister)
      * Expanded the attribute whitelist to allow more outfit attributes to become negative, such as allowing engines to produce energy while in use. (@Ferociousfiend)
      * Escorts ordered to leave the system will now ignore hostiles to leave instead of continuing to fight. (@alextd)
      * Music no longer restarts from the beginning if the track trying to be played is the same as the one already playing. (@samrocketman)
      * Overheating has been nerfed from completely disabling an overheated ship to only disabling an overheated ship's power generation. (@Amazinite)
      * Reverted how hit force is applied to ships to how it was before v0.9.9: only take the ship's mass into account instead of adding a fixed mass that reduced the hit force to small ships while increasing the hit force to large ships. (@1010todd)
  * User interface:
    * Pilot playtime is now visible in the player info panel. (@Terin)
    * The map can now be opened at the end of a conversation. (@Amazinite)
    * The player info panel now displays the current amount of combat experience and the amount of experience needed to reach the next level instead of just displaying the current level. (@Terin)
    * If moving at high speed, hitting the landing key while over an uninhabited planet will no longer attempt to land on the uninhabited planet. (@Terin)
    * Available jobs on the jobs board are now sorted alphabetically. (@quyykk)
    * Improved keyboard-triggered scrolling in shops to prevent the shop from flickering when first selecting an item with the keyboard. (@quyykk, @tehhowch)

    * The bank will now allow commas in player-entered input when applying for loans or paying off debts. (@thomasballinger)
    * Pirate raid alert messages are now considered critical messages that get highlighted. (@Terin)
    * Commodities in the plundering panel now display their unit mass. (@jostephd)

    * Added a new "fleet jump" command, activated by pressing shift+jump, as an alternative to holding the jump key. Your fleet will jump automatically once every member is ready. (@petervdmeer, @yjhn)
    * Pressing space or double clicking now pauses and unpauses the scrolling of the credits on the main menu. (@quyykk, @tehhowch)
    * The Home and End keys can now jump to the top and bottom of various panels. (@MagicMuscleMan)

    * A help dialog is now shown when attempting to buy more cargo than you have space for. (@alextd)
    * Holding ctrl when accepting a job now automatically makes room for it. (@alextd)

    * Laser weapons that fire in a burst no longer display their per-shot values, instead displaying their rate of fire as "continuous" with some percentage value next to them for the amount of time they maintain continuous fire. (@warp-core)
    * Moved the title on the main menu up 30 pixels so that it doesn't get overlapped by other UI elements that can appear in the middle of the screen. (@Amazinite)
