# This makefile wraps the Endless Sky SCons build instructions and supports the same targets
# and options it does, by simply passing them through to the SCons program. If you have Scons
# installed, this makefile will defer to your installed version. Otherwise, a local SCons package
# will be obtained from SourceForge and made available to the Endless Sky tooling.

# Build targets:
# 'dist'    - a 64-bit general-release version of Endless Sky (non-specific architecture, default target)
# 'release' - a 64-bit optimized (-O3 -march=native) version of Endless Sky for local consumption
# 'debug'   - a 64-bit version of Endless Sky with debugging symbols (-g)
# 'profile' - a 64-bit version of Endless Sky with debugging symbols and profiling hooks for gprof (-pg)
# 'clean'   - removes all compiled objects and binaries.
# 'clean-all' - runs clean, and also removes `scons-local`

# End-user configuration
# https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/BuildInstructions
# 1. Obtain the 'dev64' zip archive from the Endless Sky wiki, unzip it, and
#    set DIR_ESLIB to its location
# 2. Set BIN_DIR to where you want the exe to be placed (it will ship in a
#    config-dependent subfolder, e.g. BIN_DIR\debug\endless-sky.exe)
# 3. Set BUILDDIR to where you would like the intermediate .o files to reside
# 4. Set SCONS_VERSION to the version of the SCons program you would like to use
#    if SCons is not found in PATH
# 5. Set PYTHON_BINARY to the name or path of a Python3 binary. Python v2 is not supported.
# 6. Set AR and RANLIB to the binary archive tooling that is capable of link-time optimization
#
DIR_ESLIB ?= C:\dev64
BIN_DIR ?= bin
BUILDDIR ?= build
SCONS_VERSION ?= 4.0.1
PYTHON_BINARY ?= py
AR ?= gcc-ar
RANLIB ?= gcc-ranlib

# Note: Several tools provided by MinGW & MSYS are required.
# 1. `cURL` - command-line HTTP client, used to download the `scons-local` package from SourceForge
# 2. `tar` - command-line compression client, used to unzip the downloaded `scons-local` package
