#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Suggestions for Future Expansion
#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# - Test 'to display' on main conversation nodes, not just choices.
# - Test interactions with other conditions (e.g., `has outfit`, `credits >`, `random <`).
# - Test complex nested conditions if supported by the DSL.
# - Test failure paths explicitly (e.g., assert "failed test" == 1).
# - If possible, find more robust ways to change pilot name or other setup states than keypress simulation.
# - Add tests verifying that lines/choices *are not* displayed when conditions are *not* met.
