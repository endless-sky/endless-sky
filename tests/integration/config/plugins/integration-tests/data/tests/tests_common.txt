#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Suggestions for Future Expansion
#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# - Add more diverse save game scenarios (different factions, locations, cargo, active missions).
# - Create more robust helper functions using `command` where possible instead of `input key`.
# - Develop tests for specific game mechanics:
#   - Combat scenarios (using different fleet compositions from saves).
#   - Trading routes and profit calculation.
#   - Mission completion logic for various mission types.
#   - Fleet command testing (formation, targeting, escort behavior).
#   - Outfitting and equipment interactions.
# - Refactor or remove the "Start Game" test once the underlying issues are understood.
# - Add helper functions for common assertions (e.g., checking credits, cargo, outfits).
