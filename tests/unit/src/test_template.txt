// WHEN, and THEN macros. (There will be cases where the more traditional TEST_CASE and SECTION macros
// are better suited to declaration of the public API.)

// When writing assertions, prefer the CHECK and CHECK_FALSE macros when probing the scenario, and prefer
// the REQUIRE / REQUIRE_FALSE macros for fundamental / "validity" assertions. If a CHECK fails, the rest
// of the block's statements will still be evaluated, but a REQUIRE failure will exit the current block.
