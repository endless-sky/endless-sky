// Often we cannot test a class using just the class and primitives such as ints or doubles - we need
// classes, classes that expose a particular interface, or even calls to third party libraries like
// SDL. For unit tests, we do _NOT_ want to actually make these calls to other implementations, so we
// declare file-local mocks and/or stubs that allow us to inspect or control these calls, for the sake
// of testing our particular implementation.

// Test code goes here. Preferably, use scenario-driven language making use of the SCENARIO, GIVEN,
// WHEN, and THEN macros. (There will be cases where the more traditional TEST_CASE and SECTION macros
// are better suited to declaration of the public API.)
