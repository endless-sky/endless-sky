### When will `########` be completed?
Endless Sky is a community-driven project run entirely by volunteers. There is no specific timeline for when tasks will be worked on or finished; it depends entirely on our volunteers' schedules and availability. If you want to see something completed sooner, consider [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### What is a PR?
A PR is a "Pull Request", a request to pull specific changes into the [repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories). This is how contributors suggest changes to the game in a way that allows those changes to be reviewed and potentially added to the game. Check the official GitHub [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) for additional details.

### How can I contribute?
You may contribute in many ways. Playtesting and reviewing [PRs](#what-is-a-pr), creating your own PRs, testing and fixing bugs, showcasing the game, and many more. See our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for additional details on how to get started.

### Can I add my own faction?
Certainly! However, be aware that adding a whole new faction is a significant task, which typically requires several years before it is ready to be added to the game. If you're a new contributor, we usually recommend starting with a few smaller contributions, such as a short storyline or a couple of new missions, before attempting to create an entire faction.

### Can I use generative AI tools to contribute?
No. AI-generated or assisted content is not permitted in the Endless Sky project. See our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md#on-ai-generatedassisted-content) for further details.

### Do you accept donations?
We do not accept donations. We ask that you instead donate to a charity of your choice. Please see https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/Donations for more details.

### What is a faction lead?
"Faction Lead" is an unofficial term used by the Endless Sky community to refer to someone who is especially knowledgeable about a specific faction. They may have created the faction or made significant contributions to it. It is not an official role and does not come with any additional rights or responsibilities.

### What are author ships?
Author ships are special, unique ships that can spawn in the game. They are typically dedicated to a specific person or team of people who have made significant contributions to the project to recognize their efforts.

### What is tier?
Tiers are a balancing metric used to help our development team compare combat capabilities between ships of different factions. It is a very rough estimate of how combat-capable we expect a specific ship to be relative to other ships. Tier is not a measure of overall technological progress and should not be used as a strict guideline for what a faction can and cannot possess. A list of factions by tier is available in [Story Ideas](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/StoryIdeas).

### What is the difference between stable and unstable?
Endless Sky follows a cyclical release pattern, switching between stable and unstable versions. Unstable versions end in odd numbers and usually include new storylines, mechanics, and features, but may also have experimental elements and bugs. Stable versions end in even numbers and mainly focus on fixing bugs. You can download unstable versions using [GitHub](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/releases), [ESLauncher2](https://github.com/EndlessSkyCommunity/ESLauncher2), [Steam](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/branches) or [GOG](https://docs.gog.com/gc-beta-channels/).

### What is Continuous?
Continuous builds are the most up-to-date version of Endless Sky, generated automatically whenever a [PR](#what-is-a-pr) is [merged](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request). Continuous builds always contain the latest changes but may also contain bugs, including serious ones. If you would like to try a Continuous build they are available through [GitHub](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/releases) and [ESLauncher2](https://github.com/EndlessSkyCommunity/ESLauncher2). Continuous builds are _not_ available on Steam or GOG.

### Are there mods for Endless Sky?
Yes! Typically called plugins, there are many available for Endless Sky. You can find them on the official [plugin list](https://endless-sky.github.io/plugins.html), the #plugin-releases channel on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZeuASSx) or on sites like [moddb](https://www.moddb.com/games/endless-sky/mods). Once downloaded, simply unpack to your Plugins folder located in the Endless Sky directory and enjoy.
