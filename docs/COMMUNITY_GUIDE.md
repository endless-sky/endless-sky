### Guide to Contributing to the Endless Sky Community

When interacting, strive to maintain a friendly, empathetic tone. This includes, but is not limited to, interactions on Discord, GitHub, and Steam.

"Tone" refers to word, punctuation, and conversational choices that determine how your message _feels_ to others. This includes nonverbal cues, like emojis and gifs.

_Question:_ Hey! I'm interested in helping with development, I think some of the existing fights are too difficult and I'd like to help with rebalancing them. Where should I start?

| skill issue lol, the fights aren't too hard, they're intentionally balanced that way. Just build your ship better 😂 | Hey, welcome to the community and thanks for your interest in contributing! <br/> I would reccomend checking out our [Readme](README.md) to get a feel for the project and you could start out by posting a [discussion](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/discussions) or an [issue](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/issues) detailing which sections you find too difficult and what changes you think might help. Once you've gotten some feedback feel free to post your changes in a [Pull Request](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/pulls) so they can be reviewed. I'm looking forward to seeing what you can come up with! |

Answer 2 centered the user's feelings and as such, took more effort. However, it made a significant difference. This response:

- welcomed the new member into the community
- thanks them for their interest in contributing to the project
- gives them several resources they can use to get started
- assures them that their contribution will be properly reviewed and discussed
- gives them insight into what to expect on the path towards making a change
- ends on a positive note

Our community prides itself on being _positive_, _helpful_, and _inclusive_. If you have these goals in mind when interacting in the community, you're on the right track!

- To stay positive:

  - Make it clear that you appreciate the other person's contributions.
  - Aim to learn: even complaints can be valuable feedback.
  - Look for alternate interpretations of your message before sending, and consider clarifying your intent if you're unsure how your words might come across (using exclamation points and emojis to convey friendliness is generally 👍 !)
  - During conflict: maintain respect, avoid aggression, and avoid making it personal ("you").
  - Set boundaries. Feel free to step away from a conversation when you feel frustrated. Reach out to community leaders who can step in and de-escalate the situation. We are in this together!

- To stay helpful:

  - Seek to understand the other person's desired outcomes. Are they looking for assistance? Just wanting to vent?
  - When explaining something, first establish the knowledge level of the person you're responding to. Match your explanation to that level. A good rule of thumb is to assume that everyone is a beginner. Your response will most likely be read by others as well!
  - Ask clarifying questions. If you're not sure what the person meant, ask them if your understanding is correct. If you're not sure what they already know, ask them if they're familiar with a concept.

- To stay inclusive:

  - Refer to someone by their expressed name. Don't use your own nicknames for someone (unless you're friends with established trust).
  - Refer to someone by their expressed pronouns. If this wasn't expressed, use [`they/them`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they), which in English can be used to refer to individuals of any gender.
  - If you sense hesitancy in someone's participation, make it clear that you're happy they're participating.
  - Advocate for someone if you see that they're being dismissed.
