			`As you land, you are greeted by a man and a woman, both dressed in quite a striking manner, perhaps as a sign of distinction. They collectively begin to chant in an almost gleeful tone`
			`"We are aware of your contributions to our society, and we have a task to ask of you"`
			``
			`You note that they are all fixated on you more than you might expect.`
			choice
				`	"How can I help?"`
				`	"Sorry, I don't have the time to help."`
					decline
			`The man begins to chant`
			`"We have numerous reports from our explorers that there are Korath stranded in the Stercutus system and it's neighbours."`
			`The woman then calmly joins in, seemingly in a rehearsed manner`
			`"We believe the Korath have been stranded by the powerful electromagnetic storms that can occur in the Waste."`
			`The man ceases chanting, however, the woman continues`
			`"We want you to locate and eliminate the Korath fleets, though we warn you to be careful in dealing with the electromagnetic storms."`
			choice
				`	"How dangerous are these storms?"
				`	"I can do that."`
					accept
				`	"Sorry, but I can't help with that right now."`
					decline
			`The man begins to chant once more`
			`"The storms can weaken your shields, as well as inhibit energy generation. Though these storms seem to strike at varying intensity, and larger fleets seem to evenly absorb the shock of these storms, dulling the effects of a storm."`
			choice
				`	"I can handle that."`
					accept
				`	"Sorry, but that sounds too dangerous."`
